1010612_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that growth for outsourced customer contact management solutions and services will be fueled by the trend of global Fortune 1000 companies and medium-sized businesses turning to outsourcers to provide high-quality, cost-effective, value-added customer contact management solutions.

1010612_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Global competition, pricing pressures, softness in the global economy and rapid changes in technology continue to make it difficult for companies to cost effectively maintain the in-house personnel necessary to handle all of their customer contact management needs.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a result, companies are increasingly turning to outsourcers to perform specialized functions and services in the customer contact management arena.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	By working in partnership with outsourcers, companies can ensure that the crucial task of retaining and growing their customer base is addressed.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Companies outsource customer contact management solutions for various reasons, including the need to focus on core competencies, to drive service excellence and execution, to achieve cost savings, to scale and grow geographies and niche markets, and to efficiently allocate capital within their organizations.

1010612_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Build Long-Term Client Relationships Through Operational Excellence.

1010612_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	This standard is a compilation of more than 30 years of experience and best practices.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P13_S4	Every customer contact management center strives to meet or exceed the standard, which addresses leadership, hiring and training, performance management down to the agent level, forecasting and scheduling, and the client relationship including continuous improvement, disaster recovery plans and feedback.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Capitalize on Our Worldwide Response Team.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Companies are demanding a customer contact management solution that is global in nature one of our key strengths.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition to our network of customer contact management centers throughout North America and Europe, we continue to develop our global delivery model with operations in the Philippines, The Peoples Republic of China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Egypt, Romania, Norway and Brazil, offering our clients a secure, high-quality solution tailored to the needs of their diverse and global markets.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	With the acquisition of ICT, we expanded our global delivery model with operations in Mexico, India and Australia.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Maintain a Competitive Advantage Through Technology Solutions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	For more than 30 years, we have been an innovative pioneer in delivering customer contact management solutions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	We seek to maintain a competitive advantage and differentiation by utilizing technology to consistently deliver innovative service solutions, ultimately enhancing the client s relationship with its customers and generating revenue growth.

1010612_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Through strategic technology relationships, we are able to provide fully integrated communication services encompassing e-mail, chat, text messaging and Internet self-service platforms.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	In addition, we utilize Global Direct, our customer relationship management ( CRM )/e-commerce application for our European fulfillment operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Global Direct establishes a platform whereby our clients can manage all customer profile and contact information from every communication channel, making it a viable customer-facing infrastructure solution to support their CRM initiatives.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are also continuing to capitalize on sophisticated technological capabilities, including our current digital private network that provides us the ability to manage call volumes more efficiently by load balancing calls and data between customer contact management centers over the same network.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our converged voice and data digital communications network provides a high-quality, fault tolerant global network for the transport of Voice Over Internet Protocol communications and fully integrates with emergent Internet Protocol telephony systems as well as traditional Time Domain Multiplexing telephony systems.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our flexible, secure and scalable network infrastructure allows us to rapidly respond to changes in client voice and data traffic and quickly establish support operations for new and existing clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Continue to Grow Our Business Organically and through Acquisitions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have grown our customer contact management outsourcing operations utilizing a strategy of both internal organic growth and external acquisitions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	On February 2, 2010, we completed the ICT acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	The strategic rationale behind the acquisition was as follows:
1010612_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We doubled the number of new clients in the financial services and communication verticals, thus deepening our expertise within those verticals.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	ICT has clients in the healthcare vertical in the United States ( U.S. ), along with clients in the utilities vertical, which are new to us.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Accordingly, the ICT acquisition provided an entry into those verticals on an accelerated basis.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The ICT acquisition extends our geographic footprint into India, Mexico and Australia, providing us with additional delivery capabilities for our existing clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Sustainable Revenue Growth and Margin Expansion.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	The addition of ICT s clients to our portfolio, together with ICT s expertise in certain verticals, provides us with the ability to provide a greater depth of services to existing clients, thereby creating revenue growth rates that are expected to be more consistent and sustainable than can be achieved by growth solely from a new client sales pipeline.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	Additionally, the increase in annual revenues permits the leverage of our infrastructure to improve and sustain margins.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The increase in revenues resulting from the ICT acquisition allows us to pursue client acquisition opportunities that are larger and more complex in scope.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The addition of new clients in new verticals to our existing client portfolio further reduces our client concentration, thereby further mitigating our risk profile.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The terms of the ICT acquisition providing for each of ICT s 16.364 million outstanding shares of common stock to be converted into $7.69 in cash and 0.3423 of a share of SYKES stock allowed us to achieve the benefits of the ICT acquisition without depleting our cash reserves, thereby maintaining a strong balance sheet.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	In 2010, we realized synergies of approximately $28 million as a result of the ICT acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	These synergies were realized primarily through the elimination of duplicative general and administrative expenses, operational synergies and implementation of our lower cost structure.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our organic growth strategy is to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Entry into Brazil, Romania, Egypt and El Salvador are examples of how we leveraged these new delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Applying the key principles of our business strategy, we execute our growth strategy by focusing on the following levers.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The key driver of our revenues is increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	With the acquisition of ICT and our organic expansion, net of the sale of our Argentine operations, our seats increased to 42,700 from 32,700 in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing seat capacity as deemed necessary.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues, where we deploy the seat capacity geographically is also important.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	By broadening and continuously strengthening our global delivery footprint, we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer contact management needs globally as they enter new markets.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	As a result of the ICT acquisition and our organic expansion, net of the sale of our Argentine operations, our footprint increased to 24 countries from 20 countries in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Increasing Share of Seats Within Existing Clients and Winning New Clients .
1010612_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	We provide customer contact management support to over 100 multinational companies.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	With this client list, we have the opportunity to grow our client base.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We strive to achieve this by winning a greater share of our clients in-house seats as well as gain share from our competitors by providing consistently high-quality service.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	In addition, as we further leverage our knowledge of verticals and business lines, we plan to win new clients as a way to broaden our base of growth.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	To mitigate the impact of economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	We are targeting the following verticals for growth: communications, financial services, technology/consumer, healthcare and transportation and leisure.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	These verticals cover various business lines, including wireless services, broadband, retail banking, credit card/consumer fraud protection, content moderation, telemedicine and travel portals.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	The ICT acquisition expanded our presence in the utilities vertical, in addition to our target verticals.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we will continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Bilingual customer support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities .
1010612_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	The United States, Canada and Germany, for instance, are markets, which are served by either in-country or from offshore regions, or a combination thereof.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer contact management services.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We expanded our market presence to 18 from 17 in 2010 with the addition of Australia through the ICT acquisition and Norway, offset by the sale of our Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We specialize in providing inbound outsourced customer contact management solutions in the BPO arena on a global basis.

1010612_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	As part of our marketing efforts, we invite existing and potential clients to visit our customer contact management centers, where we can demonstrate the expertise of our skilled staff in partnering to deliver new ways of growing clients customer satisfaction and retention rates, and thus profit, through timely, insightful and proven solutions.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	During these visits, we demonstrate our ability to quickly and effectively support a new client or scale business from an existing client by emphasizing our systematic approach to implementing customer contact solutions throughout the world.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	In 2010, we provided service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Philippines, The Peoples Republic of China, India and Africa.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	These clients are Fortune 1000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the communications, financial services, technology/consumer, transportation and leisure, healthcare and other industries.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	Revenue by vertical market for 2010, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 33% for communications, 25% for financial services, 21% for technology/consumer, 7% for transportation and leisure, 7% for healthcare, and 7% for all other vertical markets, including government, retail and utilities.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Total consolidated revenues included $154.1 million, or 13.3%, of consolidated revenues for 2010 from AT T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, compared to $111.3 million, or 13.7% for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	This included $147.6 million in revenues from the Americas and $6.5 million in revenues from EMEA for 2010 and $102.1 million in revenues from the Americas and $9.2 million in revenues from EMEA for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 41% of our consolidated revenues in 2010, a decrease from 48% in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	Our broader base of clients in 2010, primarily due to the ICT acquisition, resulted in a reduction in client concentration; therefore, a lower percentage of consolidated revenues originated from our top ten clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S4	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S5	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P65_S6	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under our contracts without penalty.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The industry in which we operate is global and, therefore, highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	While many companies provide customer contact management solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer contact management operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	When it is not the in-house operations of a client, our public and private direct competition includes TeleTech, Sitel, APAC Customer Services, Convergys, West Corporation, Stream, Aegis BPO, Sutherland, 24/7 Customer, vCustomer, StarTek, Atento, Teleperformance, and NCO Group as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Wipro, Infosys and IBM.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer management solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer contact management services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer contact management solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	We own and/or have applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the United States and/or in many additional countries throughout the world.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our registered trademarks and service marks include SYKES , REAL PEOPLE.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	REAL SOLUTIONS , SCIENCE OF SERVICE , CLEARCALL , I AM SYKES.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	YOU LET ME TAKE YOU? , and ICT .
1010612_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, but may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	As of January 31, 2011, we had approximately 43,400 employees worldwide, including 40,400 customer contact agents handling technical and customer support inquiries at our centers, 2,800 in management, administration, information technology, finance, sales and marketing roles, 100 in enterprise support services, and 100 in fulfillment services.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	We have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Due to laws in their respective countries, Brazil and Spain require that wages are collectively bargained for certain non-management employees.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The negotiations are conducted irrespective of the individual employee s member status relative to the union.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	In the two countries, approximately 1,600 employees are governed by laws whereby their wages are determined by collective bargaining: 200 in Brazil and 1,400 in Spain.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P79_S3	As such, competition for such personnel is intense and employee turnover in our industry is high.
1010612_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	The following table provides the names and ages of our executive officers, and the positions and offices currently held by each of them:

1010612_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about us, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	projects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the marketplace s continued receptivity to our terms and elements of services offered under our standardized contract for future bundled service offerings; our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer contact management centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors:
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our client s products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 41% of our consolidated revenues in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	While we take measures to protect the security and privacy of this information and to prevent unauthorized access, it is possible that our security controls over personal data and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While many companies provide outsourced customer contact management services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	There are numerous and varied providers of our services, including firms specializing in call center operations, temporary staffing and personnel placement, consulting and integration firms, and niche providers of outsourced customer contact management services, many of whom compete in only certain markets.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our competitors include both companies who possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer contact management services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer contact management services companies on price.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Regardless of the outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Significant capital expenditures may be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Emergency interruption of customer contact management center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer contact management centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers, and as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer contact centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P31_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer contact centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Some of our customer contact centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we deliver offshore services, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer contact centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	At December 31, 2010, our international operations in EMEA, India and the Asia Pacific Rim were conducted from 39 customer contact management centers located in Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Egypt, South Africa, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, India, The Peoples Republic of China, Australia and the Philippines.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Revenues from these international operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, were 44%, 55%, and 60% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We also conduct business from 17 customer contact management centers located in Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	International operations are subject to certain risks common to international activities, such as changes in foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, import/export license requirements, the imposition of trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in the Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador and India which expire at varying dates from 2011 through 2018.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash balances of approximately $173.9 million (excluding restricted cash of $0.5 million) held in international operations, some of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2012 Revenue Proposals in February 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We have, from time to time, taken limited actions, such as using foreign currency forward contracts, to attempt to mitigate our currency exchange exposure.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will take any actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our offshore delivery locations include The Peoples Republic of China, Australia, the Philippines, India, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Brazil, and while we have operated in global delivery markets since 1996, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct and expand such operations, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, as with all of our operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer contact management solutions and services could effectively have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We provide services to our clients customers in 24 countries around the world.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Violations of these various laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, thereby threatening our ability to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our customer contact centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We may not succeed in our continued efforts to fully integrate the operations of ICT into our own, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	It is possible that the integration of the operations of ICT into our own could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or identify inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors and lessors, or to achieve the full level of anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Specifically, issues addressed in completing the integration of the operations of ICT into our own operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include, among other things:
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	making any necessary modifications to operating control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Integration efforts between the two companies at times may divert management attention and resources.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate ICT s operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from the ICT acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from the ICT acquisition relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The ICT acquisition resulted in substantial goodwill.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If the goodwill becomes impaired, then our profits would be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders equity would be reduced.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We recorded $97.8 million in goodwill as a result of the ICT acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	This would result in a charge to the combined company s operating earnings.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P75_S2	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer contact management services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer contact management services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Because we are a publicly traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and expensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S3	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S4	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P79_S5	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Additionally, the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) will subject us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements and disclosures, some of which have yet to be implemented by the SEC.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Compliance with their requirements may be costly and adversely affect our business.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also anticipates the enactment of regulations that may affect the ability of financial institutions to offer credit and hedging instruments without significant additional capital or other costs to them.
1010612_11_ITEM1A_P80_S3	This may make it more difficult for us to have access to foreign exchange hedging transactions on favorable terms, which may limit the predictability of cash flows from operations and result in increased operating expenses.
1010612_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the year ended December 31, 2010 relating to our periodic or current reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in Tampa, Florida.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility currently serves as the headquarters for senior management and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new customer contact management centers are available.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	During 2010, our customer contact management centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 77% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_11_ITEM2_P0_S5	The following table sets forth additional information concerning our facilities:
1010612_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Considered part of the Toronto, Ontario, Canada customer contact management center.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to these matters, we believe that we have adequate legal defenses and/or when possible and appropriate, have provided adequate accruals related to those matters such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	We have previously disclosed three pending matters involving regulatory sanctions assessed against our Spanish subsidiary.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	All three matters relate to the alleged inappropriate acquisition of personal information in connection with two outbound client contracts.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	In connection with the appeal of one of these claims, we issued a bank guarantee, which is included as restricted cash of $0.4 million and $0.5 million in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	Based upon the opinion of legal counsel regarding the likely outcome of these three matters, we accrued a liability in the amount of $1.3 million in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification 450 Contingencies because we believed that a loss was probable and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	In the quarter ended December 31, 2010, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled in our favor in one of the three subject claims.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S5	Accordingly, we have reversed the accrual in the amount of $0.5 million related to that particular claim.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S6	The accrued liability included in Other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets was $0.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM3_P1_S7	One of the other two claims has been finally decided against the Company on procedural grounds, and the final claim remains on appeal to the Spanish Supreme Court.
1010612_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol SYKE.
1010612_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information as to the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

1010612_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our effective tax rate for the periods presented includes the effects of our change of intent during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 regarding the permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings (see Note 21, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ), state income taxes, net of federal tax benefit, tax holidays, valuation allowance changes, foreign rate differentials, foreign withholding and other taxes, and other permanent differences.

1010612_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of revenues represented by certain items reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations:
1010612_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain data derived from our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts and percentage of revenues for direct salaries and related costs, general and administrative costs, impairment of goodwill and intangibles and impairment of long-lived assets for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	During 2010, we recognized consolidated revenues of $1,158.7 million, an increase of $345.1 million or 42.4%, from $813.6 million of consolidated revenues for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Excluding the ICT revenues of $362.7 million, revenues decreased $17.6 million for 2010 compared to 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	America, India and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 80.6%, or $934.3 million, for 2010 compared to 69.4%, or $565.0 million, for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa represented 19.4%, or $224.4 million, for 2010 compared to 30.6%, or $248.6 million, for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The increase in the Americas revenues was $369.3 million, or 65.4%, for 2010, compared to 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Excluding the ICT revenues of $362.7 million, the Americas revenues for 2010, compared to 2009 increased $6.6 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The $6.6 million increase consists of a positive foreign currency translation impact of $24.9 million and a favorable foreign currency hedging fluctuation of $14.4 million, partially offset by a $32.7 million decrease in revenues principally due to expiration of certain client programs and lower than forecasted demand within certain clients.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.7%, or 54.6% excluding ICT revenues, of Americas revenues, compared to 57.5% for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	We weight these factors in our focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The decrease in EMEA revenues of $24.2 million, or 9.7%, for 2010, compared to 2009, reflects a decrease of $20.7 million due largely to client program expirations, near-shore migration to lower cost geographies in Egypt, Romania and Germany and sustained weakness within the technology and communication verticals and a $4.7 million negative foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by a $1.2 million contribution in revenues from ICT.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Excluding the $4.7 million negative foreign currency translation impact, EMEA s revenues decreased 7.8% for 2010 compared to 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Direct salaries and related costs increased $235.0 million, or 45.5%, to $751.5 million for 2010 from $516.5 million in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	This increase includes ICT direct salaries and related costs of $230.1 million for 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	On a reporting segment basis, direct salaries and related costs from the Americas segment increased $239.0 million, or 70.0%, to $580.7 million for 2010 from $341.7 million in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Direct salaries and related costs from the EMEA segment decreased $4.0 million, or 2.3%, to $170.8 million for 2010 from $174.8 million in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	While changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues in the Americas, they negatively impacted direct salaries and related costs in 2010 compared to 2009 by $15.4 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	Conversely, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues in EMEA, they positively impacted direct salaries and related costs in 2010 compared to 2009 by $4.3 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 62.2% for 2010 from 60.5% in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	This increase of 1.7%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 2.8% (primarily related to lower than forecasted demand within certain clients without a commensurate reduction in labor costs and wage increases in certain geographies), higher communication costs of 0.6% and higher billable supply costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower auto tow claim costs of 1.4%, lower travel costs of 0.2%, lower bonus award costs of 0.1% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 76.1% for 2010 from 70.3% in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	This increase of 5.8%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 3.4% (primarily related to near-shore migration to new facilities in Egypt, Romania and Germany and the corresponding termination and duplicative costs), higher severance costs of 1.6%, higher travel costs of 0.2%, higher billable supply costs of 0.2%, higher recruiting costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	General and administrative expenses increased $151.6 million, or 68.2%, to $373.8 million for 2010 from $222.2 million in 2009.

1010612_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	On a reporting segment basis, general and administrative expenses from the Americas segment increased $124.3 million, or 103.6%, to $244.3 million for 2010 from $120.0 million in 2009.

1010612_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	While changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues in the Americas, they negatively impacted general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 by $4.5 million.

1010612_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	This increase of $21.1 million was primarily attributable to ICT acquisition-related costs (comprised of $14.9 million in severance costs and other costs and $6.0 million in transaction and integration costs), higher compensation costs of $0.9 million, higher travel costs of $0.4 million, higher dues and subscriptions of $0.3 million and higher training costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees of $0.9 million, lower business development costs of $0.4 million and lower other costs of $0.4 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.2% for 2010 from 21.2% in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	This increase of 5.0%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher facility-related costs of 1.4%, higher depreciation and amortization costs of 1.9%, higher equipment and maintenance costs of 0.7%, higher ICT acquisition-related costs of 1.1% (primarily severance and lease termination costs) and higher compensation costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 28.9% for 2010 from 23.6% in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	This increase of 5.3%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher facility-related costs of 2.5%, higher compensation costs of 1.0% (primarily related to near-shore migration to new facilities in Egypt, Romania and Germany and the corresponding termination and duplicative costs), higher travel costs of 0.4%, higher depreciation and amortization costs of 0.3%, higher legal and professional fees of 0.5%, higher equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2%, higher communications costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	During 2010, we reversed an accrual of $0.4 million related to the provision for regulatory penalties, which is related to one of three privacy claims associated with the alleged inappropriate acquisition of personal bank account information by our Spanish subsidiary, as a result of a favorable ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The provision was initially recorded in 2007.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	In September 2009, the building and contents of one of our customer contact management centers located in Marikina City, the Philippines (acquired as part of the ICT acquisition) was severely damaged by flooding from Typhoon Ondoy.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Upon settlement with the insurer in November 2010, we recognized a net gain of $2.0 million (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	The damaged property and equipment had been written down by ICT prior to the ICT acquisition in February 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	We make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows, investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Based on actual and forecasted operating results and deterioration of the related customer base in our ICT-acquired United Kingdom operations, the EMEA segment recorded an impairment charge of $0.4 million on goodwill and intangibles (primarily customer relationships) during 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Americas segment recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 million on goodwill and intangibles during 2009 related to the March 2005 acquisition of KLA.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	During 2010, we recorded a $3.1 million impairment charge for long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, in the Americas segment, including the Philippines and the United States (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Additionally, we recorded a $0.2 million impairment charge for long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment in the EMEA segment, including the United Kingdom and Ireland (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets which cannot be redeployed to other locations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest income was $1.2 million for 2010, compared to $2.3 million in 2009, reflecting lower average rates earned on lower average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense was $5.6 million for 2010 compared to $0.7 million in 2009, an increase of $4.9 million reflecting interest and fees on higher average levels of borrowings related to the acquisition of ICT.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect interest expense to decrease in 2011 as a result of the payoff of the $75 million Bermuda Credit Agreement and the $75 million Term Loan, drawn down in 2010 in connection with the acquisition of ICT.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	In the Americas segment, we recorded an impairment loss of $2.1 million on our entire investment in SHPS during 2009 (none in 2010).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Other expense, net, was $5.9 million for 2010 compared to $0.3 million in 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The net increase in other expenses, net, of $5.6 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.7 million in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains, an increase of $2.6 million in forward currency contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments) and an increase of $0.3 million in other miscellaneous expenses, net.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Other income (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for 2010 was based upon pre-tax income of $21.9 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $26.1 million for 2009 based upon pre-tax income of $72.3 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The effective tax rate was 10.0% for 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 36.1% for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate of 26.1% resulted primarily from the proportionately higher income under tax holiday jurisdictions, the foreign tax rate differential, a favorable change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable settlement of a tax audit, expiring statutes of limitation and tax benefits related to the ICT legal entity reorganization, and the absence of an unfavorable impact related to the $85.0 million change of intent to repatriate foreign earnings in 2009, partially offset by the lack of a release of valuation allowances and a higher proportion of withholding taxes in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	On December 17, 2010 the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Tax Relief Act ) was enacted.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Included in the Tax Relief Act is the extension until December 31, 2011 of Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	As a result of this extension, we changed our intent to distribute current earnings from various foreign operations to their foreign parents.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	These tax provisions permit continued tax deferral on such distributions that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the United States.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	While the distributions are not taxable in the United States, related withholding taxes of $1.7 million are included in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief Act, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	During December 2010, we committed to a plan and sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	We accounted for this transaction in accordance with ASC 205-20 ( ASC 205-20 ) Discontinued Operations , and, accordingly, we have reclassified the results of operations and any losses resulting from the sale for all periods presented to reflect them as such.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $6.5 million and $2.9 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	This increase of $3.6 million includes $3.3 million from the ICT Argentine operations acquired in February 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	Excluding the loss from discontinued ICT Argentine operations of $3.3 million, the loss from discontinued operations increased $0.3 million for 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	The loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, was $23.5 million for 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2010 of $32.2 million, a decrease of $40.8 million from 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	This decrease was principally attributable to a $235.0 million increase in direct salaries and related costs, a $151.6 million increase in general and administrative costs and a $3.3 million impairment of long-lived assets, partially offset by a $345.1 million increase in revenues, a $2.0 million net gain on insurance settlement, a decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangibles of $1.6 million and a $0.4 million reversal of the provision for regulatory penalties.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	In addition to the $40.8 million decrease in income from continuing operations, we experienced a $5.6 million increase in other expense, net, an increase in interest expense of $4.9 million, a $1.1 million decrease in interest income, an increase of $3.6 million of loss from discontinued operations and a $23.5 million loss on sale of discontinued operations, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million due to the impairment loss on investment in SHPS in 2009 and a $23.9 million lower tax provision, resulting in a net loss of $10.3 million for 2010, a decrease of $53.5 million compared to 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	During 2009, we recognized consolidated revenues of $813.6 million, an increase of $31.3 million or 4.0%, from $782.3 million of consolidated revenues for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Revenues increased in 2009, despite the rapid and sharp deterioration in the economy, due to increased demand from our new and existing client relationships.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	On a geographic segment basis, revenues from the Americas region, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, India and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 69.4%, or $565.0 million, for 2009 compared to 65.8%, or $514.9 million, for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa represented 30.6%, or $248.6 million, for 2009 compared to 34.2%, or $267.4 million, for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The increase in the Americas revenues of $50.1 million, or 9.7%, for 2009 compared to 2008, reflects a broad-based growth in client demand, including new and existing client relationships, partially offset by certain program expirations and a negative foreign currency impact of $13.8 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Excluding this $13.8 million foreign currency impact, Americas revenue increased $63.9 million, or 12.4% in 2009 compared to 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The $63.9 million increase includes new and existing client relationships, primarily due to a combination of new programs with existing clients, expansion of existing programs and new client relationships.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 57.5% of Americas revenues, compared to 59.0% for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	Americas revenues for 2009 and 2008 also included a $9.3 million and a $2.4 million net loss on foreign currency hedges, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	Excluding the effect of this $6.9 million foreign currency hedging fluctuation, the Americas revenues increased $57.0 million, or 11.1%, for 2009 compared to 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The decrease in EMEA s revenues of $18.8 million, or 7.1%, for 2009 compared to 2008, reflects a $22.4 million negative foreign currency impact partially offset by an increase of $3.6 million in client demand.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	This $3.6 million increase in client demand includes a $3.0 million increase in existing client programs as well as a $0.6 million increase in new client relationships.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Excluding the $22.4 million foreign currency impact, EMEA s revenues increased 1.3% for 2009 compared to 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Direct salaries and related costs increased $18.6 million, or 3.7%, to $516.5 million for 2009 from $497.9 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	On a reporting segment basis, direct salaries and related costs from the Americas segment increased $25.6 million, or 8.1%, to $341.7 million 2009 from $316.1 million for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Direct salaries and related costs from the EMEA segment decreased $7.0 million, or 3.9%, to $174.8 million for 2009 from $181.8 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenues in the Americas, they also positively impacted direct salaries and related costs in 2009 compared to 2008 by $17.3 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	While changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues in EMEA, they positively impacted direct salaries and related costs in 2009 compared to 2008 by $15.1 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs decreased to 60.5% for 2009 from 61.4% in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	This decrease of 0.9%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower auto tow claim costs of 0.7%, lower other costs of 0.4%, lower travel costs of 0.1% and lower recruiting costs of 0.1%, partially offset by higher bonus award costs of 0.2%, higher compensation costs of 0.1%, and higher communication costs of 0.1%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 70.3% for 2009 from 68.0% in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	This increase of 2.3%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.8%, higher fulfillment material costs of 0.3%, higher billable supply costs of 0.2%, higher communication costs of 0.1%, higher seminar costs of 0.1% and higher other costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower recruiting costs of 0.5%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	General and administrative expenses increased $5.3 million, or 2.4%, to $222.2 million for 2009 from $216.9 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	On a reporting segment basis, general and administrative expenses from the Americas segment increased $8.4 million, or 7.5%, to $120.0 million for 2009 from $111.6 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	General and administrative expenses from the EMEA segment decreased $5.8 million, or 8.9%, to $58.6 million for 2009 from $64.4 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	While changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues in the Americas and EMEA, they positively impacted general and administrative expenses in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 by approximately $4.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million, or 6.5%, to $43.6 million for 2009 from $40.9 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	This increase of $2.7 million was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of $3.6 million, higher software maintenance costs of $0.5 million, higher legal and professional fees of $2.6 million, higher business development costs of $0.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower travel costs of $1.3 million, lower facility-related costs of $0.2 million, lower consulting costs of $0.6 million, lower training costs of $0.7 million, lower insurance costs of $0.4 million, lower bad debt expense of $0.8 million and lower other costs of $0.6 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 21.2% for 2009 from 21.7% in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	This decrease of 0.5%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower software maintenance costs of 0.2%, recruiting costs of 0.2% and lower depreciation and amortization costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 23.6% for 2009 from 24.1% in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	This decrease of 0.5%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower travel costs of 0.3%, lower recruiting costs of 0.2%, lower facility-related costs of 0.1%, lower supply costs of 0.1%, lower communications costs of 0.1%, lower training costs of 0.1% and lower other costs of 0.3%, partially offset by higher compensation costs of 0.3%, higher bad debt expense of 0.2% and higher depreciation and amortization costs of 0.2%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows, investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Based on actual and forecasted operating results, deterioration of the related customer base and loss of key employees, the Americas segment recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 million on goodwill and intangibles during 2009 related to the March 2005 acquisition of KLA (none in 2008).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Interest income was $2.3 million in 2009, compared to $5.4 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Interest income decreased $3.1 million reflecting lower average rates earned on higher average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Interest expense was $0.7 million for 2009 compared to $0.2 million for 2008, an increase of $0.5 million reflecting higher average levels of outstanding short-term debt, primarily related to the $75 million Bermuda Credit Agreement, higher average rates, amortization of deferred loan fees and fees paid on our unused revolving credit facility.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	During 2009, we received notice from SHPS that the shareholders of SHPS had approved a merger agreement between SHPS and SHPS Acquisition, Inc., pursuant to which the common stock of SHPS, including the common stock owned by us, would be converted into the right to receive $0.000001 per share in cash.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	SHPS informed us that it believed the estimated fair value of the SHPS common stock to be equal to such per share amount.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	As a result of this transaction and careful evaluation of our legal options, we believed it was more likely than not that we will not be able to recover the $2.1 million carrying value of the investment in SHPS.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	Therefore, in the Americas segment, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $2.1 million during 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P71_S4	Subsequent to the recording of the impairment loss, we liquidated our noncontrolling interest in SHPS by converting our SHPS common stock into cash for $0.000001 per share during 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Other expense, net, was $0.3 million in 2009 compared to other income, net, of $11.3 million in 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	This $11.6 million net increase in other expense was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.6 million in unrealized foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains arising from the revaluation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities and an increase of $1.7 million in forward currency contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments), partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in other income.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	Other income excludes the effects of cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The provision for income taxes of $26.1 million for 2009 was based upon pre-tax income of $72.3 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $21.4 million for 2008 based upon pre-tax income of $84.1 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The effective tax rate was 36.1% for 2009 compared to an effective tax rate of 25.5% for 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate of 10.6% resulted primarily from our change of intent during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 regarding the permanent reinvestment of $85 million of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings, which came about due to our borrowing of a $75 million Term Loan on February 2, 2010 to close the ICT acquisition and a $10 million increase in estimated costs relating to the ICT acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The proposed acquisition of ICT and the intent to fund the transaction through committed credit facilities was announced on October 6, 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Under the provisions of ASC 740-30, we determined that, based upon historical results, we could not retire the $75 million Term Loan and pay the additional $10 million in estimated costs without depleting excess U.S. cash flows needed for future operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Accordingly, a deferred tax expense of $14.7 million, net of a release of a valuation allowance of $1.6 million on foreign tax credits related to this change in intent, was required to be recorded for financial reporting purposes during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 under ASC 740-30.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Finance Committee of our Board of Directors approved the repatriation of $85.0 million of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and undistributed earnings on February 8, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	All other undistributed earnings are still permanently reinvested in accordance with ASC 740-30.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	Other items that increased the effective tax rate were an additional deferred tax liability of $2.9 million, favorable foreign income tax rate differentials of $1.6 million and the effects of the change in our permanent differences in the amount of $1.5 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	This increase in the effective rate was partially offset by a $6.6 million change in the recognition of deferred tax assets primarily due to fluctuations in our valuation allowances, a reduction of $3.5 million in foreign withholding taxes, and a $2.9 million increase in the benefits from tax holiday jurisdictions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The reduction of $3.5 million in foreign withholding taxes was primarily a result of a reduction in the amount of dividends distributed by our Philippine company to its foreign parent in the Netherlands in 2009 when compared to 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Generally, earnings associated with our investments in our subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested and no provision for income taxes on those earnings or translation adjustments has been provided.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2010 Revenue Proposals in May 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings, including our position on permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	In response to this release, we changed our intent for 2009 with respect to the distribution of current earnings for one lower tier subsidiary and incurred withholding tax expense of $2.5 million in 2009 with respect to this subsidiary s current earnings.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	During December 2010, we committed to a plan and sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	We accounted for this transaction in accordance with ASC 205-20, and, accordingly, have reclassified the results of operations to reflect them as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $2.9 million and $2.1 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P81_S3	The $0.8 million increase in loss from discontinued operations, driven by a decrease in client demand, resulted from a $4.5 million decrease in revenues, partially offset by $1.7 million lower direct salaries and related costs, $1.4 million lower general and administrative costs and $0.6 million lower other expenses (including asset disposals and interest expense).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2009 of $73.0 million, an increase of $5.5 million from 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	This increase was principally attributable to a $31.3 million increase in revenues, partially offset by an $18.6 million increase in direct salaries and related costs, a $5.3 million increase in general and administrative costs and an impairment charge of $1.9 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The $5.5 million increase in income from continuing operations was offset by a $11.6 million decrease in other income, net, a $3.1 million decrease in interest income, a $2.1 million impairment loss on investment in SHPS, an increase in interest expense of $0.5 million, a $4.7 million higher tax provision and an increase of $0.8 million in loss from discontinued operations, resulting in net income of $43.2 million for 2009, a decrease of $17.3 million compared to 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results from continuing operations for 2010 and 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	On August 5, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	A total of 2.2 million shares have been repurchased under this program since inception.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price and general market conditions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	During 2010, we repurchased 0.3 million common shares under the 2002 repurchase program at prices ranging between $16.92 and $17.60 per share for a total cost of $5.2 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	During 2009, we repurchased 0.2 million common shares under the 2002 repurchase program at prices ranging between $13.72 and $14.75 per share for a total cost of $3.2 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	During 2008, we repurchased less than 0.1 million common shares under the 2002 repurchase program at a price of $14.83 per share for a total cost of $0.5 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	We may make additional discretionary stock repurchases under this program in 2011 depending upon economic and market conditions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	During 2010, cash increased $80.0 million upon the lapse of restrictions on our cash balances as a result of our repayment of short-term debt, we received $75.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt, $45.1 million from operating activities, $2.0 million from an insurance settlement, $0.4 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $0.2 million in cash from grant proceeds.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Further, we used $85.0 million to repay short-term debt, $77.2 million for the ICT acquisition (net of ICT cash acquired), $75.0 million to repay long-term debt, $28.5 million for capital expenditures, $14.5 million of cash divested as part of the sale of the Argentine operations, $5.2 million on the repurchase of the Company s stock, $1.3 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, invested $0.2 million in restricted cash and paid $3.0 million for loan fees related to the debt financing resulting in a $90.0 million decrease in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of $2.8 million).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2010 were $45.1 million, compared to $87.6 million provided by operating activities for 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The $42.5 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a $53.5 million decrease in net income and a net decrease of $16.7 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as the loss on sale of discontinued operations, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation and unrealized gains on financial instruments.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	The $16.7 million decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $12.6 million decrease in income taxes payable, an $7.6 million decrease in other liabilities and a $1.5 million increase in receivables, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in other assets and a $0.9 million increase in deferred revenue.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	During 2010, we committed to a plan and sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	Cash flows from discontinued operations were as follows (in millions):
1010612_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Cash provided by (used for) operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash provided by (used for) the Argentine operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations in 2010 primarily represents the cash on the balance sheet of the Argentine operations at the time of the sale.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 primarily represents capital expenditures.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	The sale of the Argentine operations resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29.9 million, or a $23.5 million loss, net of tax.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	We do not expect the sale of our Argentine operations to negatively affect our future liquidity and capital resources.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $28.5 million for 2010, compared to $30.3 million for 2009, a decrease of $1.8 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	During 2010, approximately 12% of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers, primarily in near-shore and offshore locations, and 88% was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	In 2011, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $38.0 million to $42.0 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	On February 2, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for a $75 million Term Loan and a $75 million revolving credit facility, which is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	We drew down the full $75 million Term Loan on February 2, 2010 in connection with the acquisition of ICT on such date.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the entire $75 million Term Loan has been repaid and is no longer available for borrowings.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	See Note 2, Acquisition of ICT, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the Credit Agreement dated February 2, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The $75 million revolving credit facility provided under the Credit Agreement replaces the previous senior revolving credit facility under a credit agreement, dated March 30, 2009, which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the Credit Agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	The $75 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $40 million multi-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $5 million letter of credit sub-facility, may be used for general corporate purposes including strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support, and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the revolving credit facility, if necessary.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	However, due to recent economic conditions and the volatile business climate facing financial institutions, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	The revolving credit facility will mature on February 1, 2013.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	The applicable interest rate is determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	The base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest established by KeyBank, from time to time, as its prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate in effect from time to time, plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; and (iii) the then-applicable LIBOR rate for one month interest periods, plus 1.00%.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	Swingline loans bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of up to 0.75%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the revolving credit facility.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	We paid an underwriting fee of $3.0 million for the Credit Agreement, which is deferred and amortized over the term of the loan.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The related interest expense and amortization of deferred loan fees on the Credit Agreement of $3.6 million are included in Interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	The $75 million Term Loan had a weighted average interest rate of 3.93% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the Credit Agreement dated February 2, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	On December 11, 2009, Sykes (Bermuda) Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted company ( Sykes Bermuda ) which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SYKES, entered into a credit agreement with KeyBank (the Bermuda Credit Agreement ).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Bermuda Credit Agreement provided for a $75 million short-term loan to Sykes Bermuda with a maturity date of March 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	Sykes Bermuda drew down the full $75 million on December 11, 2009, which is included in Short-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	The Bermuda Credit Agreement required that Sykes Bermuda and its direct subsidiaries maintain cash and cash equivalents of at least $80 million at all times, which amount is included in Restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	Interest was charged on the outstanding amounts, at the option of Sykes Bermuda, at either a Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Bermuda Credit Agreement) or a Base Rate (as defined in the Bermuda Credit Agreement) plus, in each case, an applicable margin specified in the Bermuda Credit Agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S5	The underwriting fee paid of $0.8 million was deferred and amortized over the term of the loan.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P98_S6	Sykes Bermuda repaid the entire outstanding amount plus accrued interest on March 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	related interest expense and amortization of deferred loan fees of $1.4 million are included in Interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2010 (none in 2009).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of the Bermuda Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guaranty of Payment agreement with KeyBank, pursuant to which the obligations of Sykes Bermuda under the Bermuda Credit Agreement were guaranteed by SYKES.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Also, simultaneous with the execution and delivery of the Bermuda Credit Agreement, SYKES, KeyBank and the other lenders that are a party thereto entered into a First Amendment Agreement, amending the credit agreement, dated March 30, 2009, between SYKES, KeyBank and the other lenders that are a party thereto.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The First Amendment Agreement amended the terms of the credit agreement to permit the loan to Sykes Bermuda and SYKES guaranty of that loan.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding balances and no borrowings in either 2010 or 2009 under the credit agreement dated March 30, 2009, as amended.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	As previously mentioned, this credit agreement was terminated on February 2, 2010 simultaneous with entering into the Credit Agreement and unamortized deferred loan fees of $0.2 million were written off during 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P101_S4	Interest expense for 2009 includes $0.1 million related to this terminated credit agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had $189.8 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash of $0.5 million), of which approximately 91.6% or $173.9 million was held in international operations, of which $113.9 million may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and repatriation tax on the foreign-source income.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	Of the remaining $60.0 million in cash and cash equivalents held in international operations, we repatriated approximately $35.0 million in January 2011 (the remaining balance of the $85.0 million 2009 change of intent) and in the future expect to repatriate $25.0 million (the remaining balance of the $50.0 million 2010 determination of intent to distribute the majority of the accumulated and undistributed earnings of an ICT foreign subsidiary).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	We believe that our current cash levels, accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows generated from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, future debt repayment requirements, continued expansion objectives, funding of potential acquisitions, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next twelve months and any stock repurchases.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	At December 31, 2010, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P106_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2010, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our operating leases as discussed in Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits (See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements), which exclude other non-cash accrued employee compensation and benefits, represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Other accrued expenses and current liabilities, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts as disclosed in Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 21 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of these long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments due under pension obligations and restructuring accruals (primarily lease obligations).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	See Notes 4 and 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results:
1010612_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call or per transaction basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Revenues from contracts with multiple-deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value, if the deliverables in the contract(s) meet the criteria for such treatment.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	Separation criteria included whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item, whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis, which generally consists of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	If there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service, revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	If there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service, the contract(s) is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	We recognize revenues for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known, uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved, and there are no client-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	Once we determine the allocation of revenues between deliverable elements, there are no further changes in the revenue allocation.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S5	If the separation criteria are met, revenues from these services is recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S6	If the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables, all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S7	For these deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value, revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P121_S8	As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no contracts containing multiple-deliverables for customer contact management services and fulfillment services.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $3.9 million as of December 31, 2010 or 1.6% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	Our estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain clients, historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	At December 31, 2010, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $60.1 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $6.2 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $53.9 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $18.3 million at December 31, 2010 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	As of December 31, 2010, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $302.8 million at December 31, 2010, as the earnings are permanently reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2012 Revenue Proposals in February 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P132_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had $21.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net increase of $17.2 million from $3.8 million as of December 31, 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	This increase results primarily from to the acquisition of ICT, partially offset by the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and for the resolution of a tax audit in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $21.0 million and $3.1 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P133_S3	We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $2.9 million due to expiration of statutes of limitations, audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	We review long-lived assets, which had a carrying value of $288.8 million as of December 31, 2010, including goodwill, intangibles and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	Upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired, we would record an impairment charge, or loss, to reduce the asset to its fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P134_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2009-13 which amended the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements .
1010612_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	The amended guidance will make it easier for companies to account for each deliverable in multiple-deliverable arrangements separately.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	The amended guidance will require the allocation of the overall consideration to each deliverable based upon its estimated selling price in absence of other objective evidence of selling prices.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P135_S3	The amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and was adopted for applicable transactions as of January 1, 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P135_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this amendment to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Acts ).
1010612_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The Acts contain provisions that could materially impact the Company s healthcare costs in the future, thus adversely affecting the Company s profitability.
1010612_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Acts, if any, on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Dollar ( USD ) are translated into the Company s USD Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Movements in non-U.S. Dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Option and forward hedge contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables, and transactions initiated in the United States that are denominated in a foreign currency.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Additionally, the Company has employed FX forward contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the Philippines and Canada, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in U.S. Dollars, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ) and the Canadian Dollar ( CAD ), which represent an FX exposure.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP and CAD by entering into foreign currency hedge contracts with counterparties to acquire a total of PHP 5.5 billion and CAD 7.5 million through December 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The fair value of these hedge contracts as of December 31, 2010 is presented in Note 12, Financial Derivatives, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S4	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2010, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the FX rates is approximately $6.1 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P5_S5	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Derivatives and Hedging , to sell 1.4 billion Philippine Pesos versus the U.S. Dollar for maturities through December 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of these derivatives was a net payable of $0.4 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2010, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $4.8 million.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P7_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Since December 31, 2010, we entered into additional foreign currency forward contracts against the following currencies: PHP, CAD, Eurodollar, Danish Krone, Great British Pound, Egyptian Pound, Australian Dollar and Romanian Leu.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These contracts, with notional amounts of $78.0 million, generally do not exceed 90 days in duration.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	During 2010, we had no debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are located beginning on page 56 and page 38 of this report, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	This report appears on page 48.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company acquired ICT on February 2, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company began to integrate ICT into its internal control over financial reporting structure subsequent to the acquisition date.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	As such, there have been changes during the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with the establishment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to ICT.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	ICT has been included in management s report of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated March 8, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	Separation criteria includes whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item, whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in the Company s control.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	Fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis, which generally consists of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	If there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service, revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	If there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service, the contract(s) is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known, uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved, and there are no client-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S5	If the separation criteria are met, revenues from these services is recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S6	If the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables, all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P91_S7	For these deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value, revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	In June 2009, the Company received notice from SHPS that the shareholders of SHPS had approved a merger agreement between SHPS and SHPS Acquisition, Inc., pursuant to which the common stock of SHPS, including the common stock owned by the Company, would be converted into the right to receive $0.000001 per share in cash.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P101_S2	SHPS informed the Company that it believed the estimated fair value of the SHPS common stock to be equal to such per share amount.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P101_S3	As a result of this transaction and evaluation of the Company s legal options, the Company believed it was more likely than not that it would not be able to recover the $2.1 million carrying value of the investment in SHPS.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P101_S4	Therefore, due to the decline in value that is other than temporary, management recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $2.1 million included in Impairment loss on investment in SHPS during 2009.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense included within general and administrative costs over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	Amounts received in excess of the cost of the building are allocated to the cost of equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P121_S3	Amortization of the deferred grants that is included as a reduction to General and administrative costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations was approximately $1.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P121_S4	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	In addition, the Company received grants from a government entity in Ireland as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a period of five years.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	The grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreement.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P122_S2	Accordingly, the grant monies received are deferred and amortized using the proportionate performance model over the five-year employment period.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	recorded as a reduction to General and administrative costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively (none in 2010).
1010612_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from six months to seven years.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P124_S2	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over the next ensuing twelve month period and the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P124_S3	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the 2004 Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), both approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 25, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P125_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, common stock units, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	The Company issues common stock and treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	In accordance with ASC 718 ( ASC 718 ) Compensation Stock Compensation , the Company recognizes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Cash, Short-Term and Other Investments, Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts, Short-Term Debt and Accounts Payable.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trusts, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	Forward Currency Forward Contracts and Options.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	Forward currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion thereof, approximates its estimated fair value as it re-prices at varying interest rates.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	Fair Value Measurements - Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 ( ASC 820 ) Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825 ( ASC 825 ) Financial Instruments .
1010612_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	ASC 825 permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P137_S1	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P137_S2	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable .
1010612_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Determination of Fair Value - The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P141_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P141_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	Money Market and Open-End Mutual Funds - The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of money market and open-end mutual funds, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options - The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over the counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P145_S2	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts - The investment assets of the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 13, Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts, and Note 25, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	Guaranteed Investment Certificates - Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P148_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P152_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P154_S1	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P155_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P160_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P160_S3	At December 31, 2010, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P161_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P161_S2	All changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Other income (expense) .
1010612_11_ITEM15_P161_S3	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, for further information on financial derivative instruments.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2009-13 which amended the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements .
1010612_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	The amended guidance will make it easier for companies to account for each deliverable in multiple-deliverable arrangements separately.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P162_S2	The amended guidance will require the allocation of the overall consideration to each deliverable based upon its estimated selling price in absence of other objective evidence of selling prices.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P162_S3	The amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and was adopted for applicable transactions as of January 1, 2011.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P162_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	On February 2, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of ICT through a merger of ICT with and into a subsidiary of the Company.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	ICT provides outsourced customer management and business process outsourcing solutions with its operations located in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, India, Australia and the Philippines.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	The results of ICT s operations have been included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements since its acquisition on February 2, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	acquired ICT to expand and complement its global footprint, provide entry into additional vertical markets, and increase revenues to enhance its ability to leverage the Company s infrastructure to produce improved sustainable operating margins.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	This resulted in the Company paying a substantial premium for ICT resulting in recognition of goodwill.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $277.8 million, which consisted of the following (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	The fair value of the 5.6 million common shares issued was determined based on the Company s closing share price of $24.40 on the acquisition date.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through borrowings consisting of a $75.0 million short-term loan from KeyBank and a $75 million Term Loan.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P168_S1	See Note 19, Borrowings, for further information.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price paid was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from ICT based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P169_S1	The Company finalized its purchase price allocation during the quarter ended December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P169_S2	The following table summarizes the estimated acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the measurement period adjustments that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 and the final purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	Includes primarily long-term deferred tax liabilities.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	The above fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	The measurement period adjustments relate primarily to unrecognized tax benefits and related offsets, tax liabilities relating to the determination as of the date of the ICT acquisition that the Company intended to distribute a majority of the accumulated and undistributed earnings of the ICT Philippine subsidiary and its direct parent, ICT Group Netherlands B.V. to SYKES, its ultimate U.S. parent, and certain accrual adjustments related to labor and benefit costs in Argentina.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P171_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the measurement period adjustments are complete.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	Total net assets acquired (liabilities assumed) by operating segment as of February 2, 2010, the acquisition date, were as follows (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	Fair values are based on management s estimates and assumptions including variations of the income approach, the cost approach and the market approach.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	The following table presents the Company s purchased intangibles assets as of February 2, 2010, the acquisition date (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	The $97.8 million of goodwill was assigned to the Company s Americas and EMEA operating segments in the amount of $97.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P175_S1	See Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for impairment of EMEA s goodwill recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P175_S2	The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to synergies the Company expects to achieve as the acquisition increases the opportunity for sustained long-term operating margin expansion by leveraging general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P175_S3	Pursuant to federal income tax regulations, the ICT acquisition was considered to be a non-taxable transaction; therefore, no amount of intangibles or goodwill from this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P175_S4	The fair value of receivables acquired is $75.9 million, with the gross contractual amount being $76.4 million, of which $0.5 million was not expected to be collected.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	After the ICT acquisition in February, 2010, the Company paid off the $10.0 million outstanding balance plus accrued interest of the ICT short-term debt assumed upon acquisition.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P176_S1	The related interest expense included in Interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was not material.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	The amount of ICT s revenues and net loss since the February 2, 2010 acquisition date, included in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, are $362.7 million and $(26.9) million, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P177_S1	The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined revenues and net earnings as if ICT had been included in the consolidated results of the Company for the entire year for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P177_S2	The pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and related borrowings had taken place on January 1, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1010612_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	These amounts have been calculated to reflect the additional depreciation, amortization, and interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the fair value adjustments and borrowings occurred on January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2009, together with the consequential tax effects.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	In addition, these amounts exclude costs incurred which are directly attributable to the acquisition, and which do not have a continuing impact on the combined companies operating results.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	Included in these costs are severance, advisory and legal costs, net of the consequential tax effects.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	Acquisition-related costs of $46.3 million, comprised of $16.3 million in severance costs ($14.9 million in Corporate, $1.2 million in the Americas and $0.2 million in EMEA), $8.9 million in lease termination and other costs ($7.2 million in Americas and $1.7 million in EMEA), $9.3 million in transaction and integration costs (all Corporate), and $11.8 million in additional depreciation (in Americas) related to the increase in fair values of the acquired property and equipment and amortization of the fair values of the acquired intangibles, are included in General and administrative costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	On December 16, 2010, the Board of Directors of SYKES, upon the recommendation of its Finance Committee, approved a plan to sell its Argentina operations, which were operated through two Argentine subsidiaries: Centro Interaccion Multimedia S.A. ( CIMSA ) and ICT Services of Argentina, S.A. ( ICT Argentina ), together the Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P180_S1	CIMSA and ICT Argentina were offshore contact centers providing contact center services through a total of three centers in Argentina to clients in the United States and in the Republic of Argentina.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P180_S2	The decision to exit Argentina was made due to surging costs, primarily chronic wage increases, which dramatically reduced the appeal of the Argentina footprint among the Company s existing and new global clients and thus the overall future profitability of the Argentine operations.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	On December 13, 2010, the Company entered a stock purchase agreement, and pursuant thereto, on December 16, 2010, the Company completed the sale of all of the shares of capital stock of CIMSA to individual purchasers for a nominal price.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	Pursuant to the CIMSA stock purchase agreement, immediately prior to closing, the Company made a capital contribution of $9.5 million to CIMSA to cover a portion of CIMSA s liabilities.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P181_S2	Immediately after closing, the purchasers made a capital contribution to CIMSA of $1.0 million, and CIMSA repaid a loan of $1.0 million to one of the Company s subsidiaries.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P181_S3	As this was a stock transaction, the Company has no future obligation with regard to CIMSA and there are no material post closing obligations.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	Additionally, on December 22, 2010, the Company entered into a letter of intent (the ICT Letter of Intent ) to sell all of the shares of capital stock of ICT Argentina to a group of individual purchasers for a nominal purchase price.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P182_S1	Pursuant to the ICT Letter of Intent, immediately prior to closing, the Company funded ICT Argentina with a capital contribution of $3.5 million to cover a portion of ICT Argentina s liabilities.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P279_S1	These tax provisions permit continued tax deferral on such distributions that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the United States.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P279_S2	While the distributions are not taxable in the United States, related withholding taxes of $1.7 million are included in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2010.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P281_S2	Of the $85.0 million change of intent, $50.0 million was distributed in 2010.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P281_S3	Of the $14.7 million net deferred tax liability originally recorded, $6.4 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2010.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P283_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S0	The Company has been granted tax holidays in the Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador and India.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S1	The tax holidays have various expiration dates ranging from 2011 through 2018.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S4	This could potentially result in future adverse tax consequences.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P284_S5	The Company s tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $6.8 million ($0.15 per diluted share), $13.8 million ($0.34 per diluted share) and $10.9 million ($0.27 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P286_S0	In 2010, the Company s valuation allowance increased by $28.0 million, primarily related to the acquisition of ICT and current year net operating losses where the Company recorded additional valuation allowances on foreign subsidiaries related to the future use of their current year net operating losses.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P287_S2	Of this $21.2 million carry forward, $10.1 million is limited as it relates to net operating loss carryforwards of a domestic subsidiary acquired in prior years and the remaining $11.1 million, attributable to the acquisition of ICT, is limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P287_S3	Regarding the U.S. state operations, of the $144.8 million, no benefit has been recognized for $91.0 million as it is more likely than not that these losses will expire without realization of tax benefits.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P288_S1	This increase results primarily from the acquisition of ICT, partially offset by the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and for the resolution of a tax audit in the current year.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P288_S2	Had the Company recognized these tax benefits, approximately $21.0 million and $3.1 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P288_S3	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $2.9 million due to expiration of statutes of limitations, audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P289_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P295_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P303_S0	The following is a schedule of future minimum purchases remaining under the agreements as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

1010612_11_ITEM15_P306_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has director and officer insurance coverage that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P306_S2	The Company believes the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_11_ITEM15_P306_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the Company could be obligated to make.

1010612_11_ITEM15_P307_S3	Based upon the opinion of legal counsel regarding the likely outcome of these three matters, the Company accrued a liability in the amount of $1.3 million under ASC 450 Contingencies because management believed that a loss was probable and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated.

1010612_12_ITEM1_P10_S11	We have grown our customer contact management outsourcing operations utilizing a strategy of both internal organic growth and external acquisitions.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P10_S12	Our organic growth strategy is to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P10_S13	Entry into Brazil, Romania, Egypt and El Salvador are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Applying the key principles of our business strategy, we execute our growth strategy by focusing on the following levers.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The key driver of our revenues is increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing seat capacity as deemed necessary.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Additionally, we have the ability to expand our current seat capacity of 41,300 through strategic acquisitions and organic expansion.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues, where we deploy the seat capacity geographically is also important.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint, we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer contact management needs globally as they enter new markets.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	At the end of 2011, our global delivery footprint spanned 23 countries.

1010612_12_ITEM1_P13_S4	Additionally, with the rapid emergence of on-line communities, examples of which are chat rooms, Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Increasing Share of Seats Within Existing Clients and Winning New Clients .
1010612_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We provide customer contact management support to numerous multinational companies.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We strive to achieve this by winning a greater share of our clients in-house seats as well as gain share from our competitors by providing consistently high-quality service.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, as we further leverage our knowledge of verticals and business lines, we plan to win new clients as a way to broaden our base of growth.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	To mitigate the impact of any negative economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	We are targeting the following verticals for growth: communications, financial services, technology/consumer, healthcare and transportation and leisure.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	These verticals cover various business lines, including wireless services, broadband, retail banking, credit card/consumer fraud protection, content moderation, telemedicine and travel portals.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S6	To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we will continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P15_S7	Bilingual customer support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities .
1010612_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve.

1010612_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer contact management services.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We currently operate in 17 markets, which exclude Spain as a result of the planned sale of those operations.

1010612_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	In an effort to stay ahead of industry offshoring trends, we opened our first offshore customer contact management centers in The Philippines and Costa Rica over ten years ago.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	Since then, we have expanded into centers in The People s Republic of China, India, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We utilize a sophisticated workforce management system to provide efficient scheduling of personnel.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our internally developed digital private communications network complements our workforce by allowing for effective call volume management and disaster recovery backup.

1010612_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	We also can offer cost competitive solutions for taking calls to our offshore locations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our data warehouse captures and downloads customer contact information for reporting on a daily, real-time and historical basis.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	This data provides our clients with direct visibility into the services that we are providing for them.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	The data warehouse supplies information for our performance management systems such as our agent scorecarding application, which provides management with the information required for effective management of our operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our customer contact management centers are protected by a fire extinguishing system, backup generators with significant capacity and 24 hour refueling contracts and short-term battery backups in the event of a power outage, reduced voltage or a power surge.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	Rerouting of call volumes to other customer contact management centers is also available in the event of a telecommunications failure, natural disaster or other emergency.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Security measures are imposed to prevent unauthorized physical access.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Software and related data files are backed up daily and stored off site at multiple locations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	We carry business interruption insurance covering interruptions that might occur as a result of certain types of damage to our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We currently have two fulfillment centers located in Europe.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	We provide our fulfillment services primarily to certain clients operating in Europe who desire this complementary service in connection with outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our two enterprise support services offices are located in metropolitan areas in the United States to provide a recruiting platform for high-end knowledge workers and to establish a local presence to service major accounts.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	Quality Assurance We believe that providing consistent high-quality service is critical in our clients decision to outsource and in building long-term relationships with our clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	It is also our belief and commitment that quality is the responsibility of each individual at every level of the organization.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P27_S5	To ensure service excellence and continuity across our organization, we have developed an integrated Quality Assurance program consisting of three major components:
1010612_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The application of process audits to all work procedures.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	and best practices from industry standards such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and Customer Operations Performance Center.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	It specifies the requirements that must be met in each of our customer contact management centers including measured performance against our standard operating procedures.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	It has a well-defined auditing process that ensures compliance with the SYKES standards.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our focus is on quality, predictability and consistency over time, not just point in time certification.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	The application of continuous improvement is based upon the five-step Six Sigma cycle, which we have fine-tuned to apply specifically to our service industry.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P29_S5	All managers are responsible for continuous improvement in their operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Process audits are used to verify that processes and procedures are consistently executed as required by established documentation.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Process audits are applicable to services being provided for the client and internal procedures.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing objective is to leverage our expertise and global presence to develop long-term relationships with existing and future clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our customer contact management solutions have been developed to help our clients acquire, retain and increase the value of their customer relationships.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our plans for increasing our visibility include market-focused advertising, consultative personal visits, participation in market-specific trade shows and seminars, speaking engagements, articles and white papers, and our website.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our sales force is composed of business development managers who pursue new business opportunities and strategic account managers who manage and grow relationships with existing accounts.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	We emphasize account development to strengthen relationships with existing clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Business development management and strategic account managers are assigned to markets in their area of expertise in order to develop a complete understanding of each client s particular needs, to form strong client relationships and encourage cross-selling of our other service offerings.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	We have inside customer sales representatives who receive customer inquiries and who provide outbound lead generation for the business development managers.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	We also have relationships with channel partners including systems integrators, software and hardware vendors and value-added resellers, where we pair our solutions and services with their product offering or focus.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S5	We plan to maintain and expand these relationships as part of our sales and marketing strategy.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S6	As part of our marketing efforts, we invite existing and potential clients to visit our customer contact management centers, where we can demonstrate the expertise of our skilled staff in partnering to deliver new ways of growing clients customer satisfaction and retention rates, and thus profit, through timely, insightful and proven solutions.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S7	During these visits, we demonstrate our ability to quickly and effectively support a new client or scale business from an existing client by emphasizing our systematic approach to implementing customer contact solutions throughout the world.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S8	Clients We provide service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe and Africa.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S9	These clients are Fortune 1000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the communications, financial services, technology/consumer, transportation and leisure, healthcare and other industries.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P32_S10	Revenue by vertical market for 2011, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 31% for communications, 29% for financial services, 19% for technology/consumer, 7% for transportation and leisure, 6% for healthcare, 6% for retail and 2% for all other vertical markets, including government and utilities.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Total consolidated revenues included $132.7 million, or 11.3%, of consolidated revenues for 2011, from AT T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, compared to $154.1 million, or 13.7% for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	This included $129.4 million in revenues from the Americas and $3.3 million in revenues from EMEA for 2011 and $147.6 million in revenues from the Americas and $6.5 million in revenues from EMEA for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated revenues in 2011, an increase from 42% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P33_S6	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under our contracts without penalty.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Competition The industry in which we operate is global and, therefore, highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	While many companies provide customer contact management solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer contact management operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	When it is not the in-house operations of a client, our public and private direct competition includes TeleTech, Sitel, Convergys, West Corporation, Stream, Aegis BPO, Sutherland, 24/7 Customer, vCustomer, StarTek, Atento, Teleperformance, and NCO Group as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Wipro, Infosys and IBM.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer management solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P34_S6	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer contact management services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer contact management solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	We own and/or have applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the United States and/or in many additional countries throughout the world.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our registered trademarks and service marks include SYKES , REAL PEOPLE.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	REAL SOLUTIONS , SCIENCE OF SERVICE , CLEARCALL , I AM SYKES.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	HOW FAR WILL YOU LET ME TAKE YOU? , ICT and SOUND OF SERVICE .
1010612_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, but may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Employees As of January 31, 2012, we had approximately 41,000 employees worldwide, including 38,100 customer contact agents handling technical and customer support inquiries at our centers, 2,600 in management, administration, information technology, finance, sales and marketing roles, 100 in enterprise support services, and 200 in fulfillment services.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	We have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Due to laws in their respective countries, Brazil and Spain require that wages are subject to collective bargaining for approximately 200 non-management employees in Brazil and approximately 1,600 in Spain.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	The negotiations are conducted irrespective of the individual employee s membership status relative to the union.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements.
1010612_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	As such, competition for such personnel is intense and employee turnover in our industry is high.

1010612_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1010612_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer contact management centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our clients products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated revenues in 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Cyber attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business is heavily dependent upon our computer and voice technologies, systems and platforms.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our call centers and impede our ability to provide critical services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we take measures to protect the security of, and unauthorized access to our systems, as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	While many companies provide outsourced customer contact management services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	There are numerous and varied providers of our services, including firms specializing in call center operations, temporary staffing and personnel placement, consulting and integration firms, and niche providers of outsourced customer contact management services, many of whom compete in only certain markets.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our competitors include both companies who possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer contact management services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S8	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S9	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer contact management services companies on price.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P5_S11	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The concentration of customer support centers in certain geographies poses risks to our operations which could adversely affect our financial condition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Although we have call centers in many locations throughout the world, we have a concentration of centers in certain geographies outside of the U.S. and Canada, specifically The Philippines and Latin America.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our concentration of operations in those geographies is a result of our ability to access significant numbers of employees with certain language and other skills at costs that are advantageous.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	However, the concentration of business activities in any geographical area creates risks which could harm operations and our financial condition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Certain risks, such as natural disasters, armed conflict and military or civil unrest, political instability and disease transmission, as well as the risk of interruption to our delivery systems, is magnified when the realization of these, or any other risks, would effect a large portion of our business at once, which may result in a disproportionate increase in operating costs.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Regardless of the outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Significant capital expenditures may be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Emergency interruption of customer contact management center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer contact management centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers, and as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer contact centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer contact centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Some of our customer contact management centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P17_S11	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we maintain customer contact management centers, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer contact management centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	At December 31, 2011, our international operations were conducted from 34 customer contact management centers located in Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Egypt, South Africa, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, The Philippines, The Peoples Republic of China, India and Australia.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Revenues from these international operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, were 43%, 42%, and 53% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also conduct business from 17 customer contact management centers located in Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	International operations are subject to certain risks common to international activities, such as changes in foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, import/export license requirements, the imposition of trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador and India which expire at varying dates from 2012 through 2023.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash balances of approximately $163.9 million held in international operations, most of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2013 Revenue Proposals in February 2012.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of our foreign currency exchange exposure.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will take any actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Additionally, our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risks is not secured by any collateral.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Although each of the counterparty financial institutions with which we place hedging contracts are investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of the time of the placement, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability of any of our counterparties.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If a counterparty to one or more of our hedge transactions were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor and our exposure at the time would depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, as with all of our operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer contact management solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We provide services to our clients customers in 23 countries around the world, excluding Spain as a result of the planned sale of those operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Violations of these various laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries as well as recently enacted statutory and regulatory requirements related to derivative transactions, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, or impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges, thereby threatening or limiting our ability or the financial benefit to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations, or the risks associated therewith.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Risks Related to Our Employees Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S8	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our customer contact centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may not succeed in our continued efforts to fully integrate the operations of ICT into our own, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	It is possible that the integration of the operations of ICT into our own could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or identify inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors and lessors, or to achieve the full level of anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Specifically, issues addressed in completing the integration of the operations of ICT into our own operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include, among other things:
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	making any necessary modifications to operating control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Integration efforts between the two companies at times may divert management attention and resources.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate ICT s operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We have substantial goodwill and if it becomes impaired, then our profits would be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders equity would be reduced.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We recorded goodwill as a result of the ICT acquisition.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S6	This would result in a charge to our operating earnings.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S9	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S10	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S11	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S12	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S13	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer contact management services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S14	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer contact management services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S15	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S16	Because we are a publicly traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and expensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S17	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S18	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S19	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S20	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S21	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S22	Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) enacted in 2010 subjects us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements and disclosures, some of which have yet to be implemented by the SEC.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P38_S23	Compliance with their requirements may be costly and adversely affect our business.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	capital or other costs to them.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	This may make it more difficult for us to have access to foreign exchange hedging transactions on favorable terms, which may limit the predictability of cash flows from operations and result in increased operating expenses.
1010612_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the year ended December 31, 2011 relating to our periodic or current reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new customer contact management centers are available.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	During 2011, our customer contact management centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 74% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	The following table sets forth additional information concerning our facilities:
1010612_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	(2) Customer contact management center closed in December, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	(3) Considered part of the Toronto, Ontario, Canada customer contact management center.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	that we have adequate legal defenses and/or when possible and appropriate, have provided adequate accruals related to those matters such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We have previously disclosed pending matters involving regulatory sanctions assessed against our Spanish subsidiary, which is classified as discontinued operations.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	All of these matters relate to the alleged inappropriate acquisition of personal information in connection with two outbound client contracts.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	Based upon the opinion of legal counsel regarding the likely outcome of these matters, we accrued a $1.3 million liability under ASC 450 Contingencies because management believed that a loss was probable and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	Due to the favorable rulings by the Spanish Supreme Court, we reversed $0.4 million and $0.5 million of the accrued liability during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	The remaining accrued liability of $0.4 million is included in Liabilities held for sale discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S6	As of December 31, 2010, the accrued liability of $0.8 million was included in Other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S7	The final claim was finally decided against us on procedural grounds, but subsequent to year end, the assessed fine associated with that claim was settled at no cost to us.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S8	In connection with the appeal of one of these claims, we issued a bank guarantee, which is included as restricted cash of $0.4 million in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM3_P0_S9	Due to the favorable ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court mentioned above, we released the bank guarantee during the three months ended December 31, 2011.

1010612_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 24, 2012, there were 985 holders of record of the common stock.
1010612_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We estimate there were approximately 5,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.

1010612_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	See Results of Operations Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Unless otherwise noted, discussions below pertain only to our continuing operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Acquisition of ICT On February 2, 2010, we completed the acquisition of ICT Group, Inc. ( ICT ), a Pennsylvania corporation and a leading global provider of outsourced customer management and BPO solutions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We refer to such acquisition herein as the ICT acquisition.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	each outstanding ICT stock option, whether or not then vested and exercisable, became fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to, and then was canceled at, the effective time of the acquisition, and the holder of such option became entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less any applicable taxes to be withheld, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (1) $15.38 over (2) the exercise price per share of ICT common stock subject to such ICT stock option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of ICT common stock underlying such ICT stock option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest cent.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	each outstanding ICT restricted stock unit ( RSU ) became fully vested and then was canceled and the holder of such vested awards became entitled to receive $15.38 in cash, without interest and less any applicable taxes to be withheld, in respect of each share of ICT common stock into which the RSU would otherwise have been convertible.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The total aggregate purchase price of the transaction of $277.8 million was comprised of $141.1 million in cash and 5.6 million shares of SYKES common stock valued at $136.7 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The transaction was funded through borrowings consisting of a $75 million short-term loan from KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank ) in December 2009, due March 31, 2010, and a $75 million term loan from a syndicate of banks due in varying installments through February 1, 2013.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Both of these loans were repaid during 2010 and are no longer available for borrowings.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	See Liquidity Capital Resources later in this Item 7 for further information.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The results of operations of ICT have been reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the period from February 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of revenues represented by certain items reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations:
1010612_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain data derived from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):
1010612_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The following table summarizes our revenues for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following table summarizes certain amounts and percentages of revenues for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	2011 Compared to 2010 Revenues For 2011, we recognized consolidated revenues of $1,169.3 million, an increase of $47.4 million or 4.2%, from $1,121.9 million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	On a geographic segment basis, revenues from the Americas region, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 82.4%, or $963.1 million, for 2011 compared to 83.3%, or $934.3 million, for the comparable period in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa, represented 17.6%, or $206.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 16.7%, or $187.6 million, for the comparable period in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	America s revenues increased $28.8 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $10.8 million, for 2011 from 2010, principally due to higher acquisition-related revenues of $4.2 million, new client programs and higher volumes within new and certain existing clients.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.8% of Americas revenues, compared to 47.7% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	We weight these factors in our focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	EMEA s revenues increased $18.6 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $9.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the comparable period in 2010, principally due to new client programs and higher volumes within new and certain existing clients.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	This $18.6 million increase is net of a $1.2 million decrease in revenues due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2010 Exit Plan.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Direct Salaries and Related Costs Direct salaries and related costs increased $48.4 million, or 6.7%, to $763.9 million for 2011 from $715.5 million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	On a reporting segment basis, direct salaries and related costs from the Americas segment increased $31.1 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $16.9 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Direct salaries and related costs from the EMEA segment increased $17.3 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $7.2 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 63.5% for 2011 from 62.2% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	This increase of 1.3%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.4% (principally related to lower volumes within certain existing clients without a commensurate reduction in labor costs) and higher other costs of 0.1%, partially offset by lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S7	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 73.8% for 2011 from 71.9% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S8	This increase of 1.9%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher severance costs of 0.7% due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, higher compensation costs of 0.6%, higher fulfillment shipping material costs of 0.4%, higher communication costs of 0.2%, higher automobile-related costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.1%, partially offset by lower travel costs of 0.3%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S9	General and Administrative General and administrative expenses decreased $25.0 million, or 6.8%, to $341.6 million for 2011 from $366.6 million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S10	On a reporting segment basis, general and administrative expenses from the Americas segment decreased $6.3 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $5.3 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P16_S11	General and administrative expenses from the EMEA segment decreased $0.5 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $2.5 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	This decrease of $18.2 million was primarily attributable to lower merger and acquisition costs of $22.9 million, partially offset by higher legal and professional fees of $1.4 million, higher charitable contributions of $1.3 million, higher software maintenance of $0.6 million, higher compensation costs of $0.6 million, higher consulting costs of $0.2 million, higher training costs of $0.2 million and higher other costs of $0.4 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.7% for 2011 from 26.1% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	This decrease of 1.4%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower merger and acquisition costs of 0.9%, lower depreciation of 0.3% and lower other taxes of 0.2%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 27.8% for 2011 from 30.8% in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	This decrease of 3.0%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.2%, lower merger and acquisition costs of 1.0%, lower facility-related costs of 0.6%, lower travel costs of 0.3%, lower legal and professional fees of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.4%, partially offset by higher severance costs of 0.8% primarily due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net (Gain) Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment Net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment was $(3.0) million during 2011, primarily due to the gain on the sale of land and a building located in Minot, North Dakota.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Net loss on disposal of property and equipment was $0.1 million during 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net (Gain) on Insurance Settlement Net (gain) on insurance settlement of $(0.5) million and $(2.0) million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily relates to funds received for flood damage from Typhoon Ondoy to the building and contents of one of our customer contact management centers located in Marikina City, The Philippines (acquired as part of the ICT acquisition).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The damaged property and equipment had been written down by ICT prior to the ICT acquisition in February 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	No additional funds are expected related to the Typhoon Ondoy insurance claim.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles We make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows, investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Based on actual and forecasted operating results and deterioration of the related customer base in our ICT-acquired United Kingdom operations, the EMEA segment recorded a $0.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangibles, primarily customer relationships, during 2010 (none in 2011).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets During 2011, we recorded a $1.7 million impairment of long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment, consisting of $1.2 million in the Americas segment and $0.5 million in the EMEA segment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	During 2010, we recorded a $3.3 million impairment of long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment, consisting of $3.1 million in the Americas segment and $0.2 million in the EMEA segment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	The impairments represented the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets which cannot be redeployed to other locations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Interest Income Interest income was $1.4 million for 2011, compared to $1.2 million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase of $0.2 million reflects higher average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Interest (Expense) Interest (expense) was $(1.1) million for 2011, compared to $(4.9) million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	The decrease of $3.8 million reflects interest and fees on higher average levels of borrowings in 2010 related to the ICT acquisition.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Other (Expense) Other (expense), net, was $(2.1) million for 2011, compared to $(5.9) million in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	(expense), net, of $3.8 million was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.1 million in forward currency contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments) and a decrease of $1.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in other miscellaneous income, net.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The provision for income taxes of $11.3 million for 2011 was based upon pre-tax income of $63.7 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for 2010 based upon pre-tax income of $28.3 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The effective tax rate was 17.8% for 2011, compared to an effective tax rate of 7.8% for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The increase in the effective tax rate of 10.0% resulted primarily from the shift of earnings to higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a favorable foreign tax rate differential, changes in uncertain tax positions due to the favorable settlements of tax audits and expiring statutes of limitation, in conjunction with 2010 tax benefits related to the ICT legal entity reorganization.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	On December 17, 2010 the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Tax Relief Act ) was enacted.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Included in the Tax Relief Act is the extension until December 31, 2011 of Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result of this extension, we changed our intent to distribute current earnings from various foreign operations to their foreign parents.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	These tax provisions permit continued tax deferral through 2011 on such distributions that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the United States.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	While the distributions are not taxable in the United States, related withholding taxes of $2.7 million are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief Act, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	(Loss) from Discontinued Operations In November 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our Spanish operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	Also, in December 2010, we sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	Accordingly, we have reflected the operating results related to these operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	The (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $(4.6) million and $(12.9) million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S6	The gain (loss) on sale, net of taxes, of the Argentine operations totaled $0.5 million and $(23.5) million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S7	The gain on sale during 2011 resulted from the reversal of the accrued liability related to the expiration of the indemnification to the purchaser for the possible loss of a specific client business.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S8	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2011 of $65.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million from 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S9	This increase was principally attributable to a $47.4 million increase in revenues, a $25.0 million decrease in general and administrative costs, a $3.1 million increase in net gain on disposal of property and equipment, a $1.6 million decrease in impairment of long-lived assets and a decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangibles of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $48.4 million increase in direct salaries and related costs and a $1.5 million decrease in net gain on insurance settlement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P26_S10	In addition to the $27.6 million increase in income from continuing operations, we experienced a $3.8 million decrease in other expense, net, a decrease in interest expense of $3.8 million, a $0.2 million increase in interest income, a decrease of $8.3 million in loss from discontinued operations and a $24.0 million decrease in loss on sale of discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase of $9.1 million in the tax provision, resulting in net income of $48.3 million for 2011, an increase of $58.6 million compared to 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	2010 Compared to 2009 Revenues In 2010, we recognized consolidated revenues of $1,121.9 million, an increase of $352.5 million or 45.8%, from $769.4 million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Excluding the ICT revenues of $362.7 million, revenues decreased $10.2 million for 2010 compared to 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	On a geographic segment basis, revenues from the Americas region, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 83.3%, or $934.3 million, for 2010 compared to 73.4%, or $565.0 million, for 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa, represented 16.7%, or $187.6 million, for 2010 compared to 26.6%, or $204.4 million, for 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Americas revenues increased $369.3 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $36.2 million, for 2010 from 2009, principally due to higher acquisition-related revenues of $361.5 million, partially offset by expiration of certain client programs and lower than forecasted demand within certain clients.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.7% of Americas revenues for 2010, compared to 57.5% in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	We weight these factors in our focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	EMEA s revenues decreased $16.8 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $3.2 million, for 2010 from 2009, principally due largely to client program expirations, near-shore migration to lower cost geographies in Egypt, Romania and Germany and sustained weakness in the technology and communication verticals.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	This decrease is partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in acquisition-related revenues.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Direct Salaries and Related Costs Direct salaries and related costs increased $233.7 million, or 48.5%, to $715.5 million for 2010 from $481.8 million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	This increase includes ICT direct salaries and related costs of $230.1 million for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	On a reporting segment basis, direct salaries and related costs from the Americas segment increased $239.0 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $26.4 million, for 2010 from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	Direct salaries and related costs from the EMEA segment decreased $5.3 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $2.6 million, for 2010 from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 62.2% for 2010 from 60.5% in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S7	This increase of 1.7%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 2.8% (related to lower than forecasted demand within certain clients without a commensurate reduction in labor costs and wage increases in certain geographies), higher communication costs of 0.6% and higher billable supply costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower automobile tow claim costs of 1.4%, lower travel costs of 0.2%, lower bonus award costs of 0.1% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S8	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 71.9% for 2010 from 68.6% in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S9	This increase of 3.3%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.7% (related to near-shore migration to new facilities in Egypt, Romania and Germany and the corresponding termination and duplicative costs), higher severance costs of 0.8%, higher recruiting costs of 0.3%, higher communication costs of 0.2%, higher travel costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S10	General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased $152.3 million, or 71.1%, to $366.6 million for 2010 from $214.3 million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S11	This increase includes ICT general and administrative costs of $139.6 million for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S12	On a reporting segment basis, general and administrative expenses from the Americas segment increased $124.2 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $8.3 million, for 2010 from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S13	General and administrative expenses from the EMEA segment increased $7.0 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $1.3 million, for 2010 from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P28_S14	Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $21.1 million for 2010 from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	of $20.9 million, higher compensation costs of $0.6 million, higher travel costs of $0.4 million, higher dues and subscriptions of $0.3 million and higher training costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees of $0.9 million and lower business development costs of $0.4 million and lower other costs of $0.1 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.1% for 2010 from 21.2% in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	This increase of 4.9%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher depreciation costs of 1.9%, higher facility-related costs of 1.3%, higher merger and acquisition costs of 0.9%, higher equipment and maintenance costs of 0.7% and higher compensation costs of 0.5%, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 30.8% for 2010 from 24.8% in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	This increase of 6.0%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher facility-related costs of 1.9%, higher compensation costs of 0.9% (related to near-shore migration to new facilities in Egypt, Romania and Germany in 2010 and the corresponding termination and duplicative costs), higher merger and acquisition costs of 0.9%, higher travel costs of 0.6%, higher legal and professional fees of 0.5%, higher depreciation costs of 0.4%, higher equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2%, higher communications costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.4%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	Net (Gain) Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment Net loss on disposal of property and equipment was $0.1 million during 2010, compared to $0.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $0.1 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	Net (Gain) on Insurance Settlement Net (gain) on insurance settlement of $(2.0) million in 2010 (none in 2009) relates to funds received for flood damage from Typhoon Ondoy to the building and contents of one of our customer contact management centers located in Marikina City, The Philippines (acquired as part of the ICT acquisition).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	The damaged property and equipment had been written down by ICT prior to the ICT acquisition in February 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles We make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows, investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Based on actual and forecasted operating results and deterioration of the related customer base in our ICT-acquired United Kingdom operations, the EMEA segment recorded a $0.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangibles, primarily customer relationships, during 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Americas segment recorded a $1.9 million impairment of goodwill and intangibles during 2009 related to the March 2005 acquisition of KLA.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets During 2010, we recorded a $3.3 million impairment of long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment, consisting of $3.1 million in the Americas segment and $0.2 million in the EMEA segment (none in 2009).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	The impairments represented the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets which cannot be redeployed to other locations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest Income Interest income was $1.2 million during 2010, compared to $2.3 million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease of $1.1 million reflects lower average rates earned on lower average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Interest (Expense) Interest (expense) was $(4.9) million during 2010, compared to $(0.2) million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	The increase of $4.7 million reflecting interest and fees on higher average levels of borrowings in 2010 related to the ICT acquisition.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Impairment (Loss) on Investment in SHPS In the Americas segment, we recorded an impairment of $2.1 million on our entire investment in SHPS during 2009 (none in 2010).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Other (Expense) Other (expense), net, was $(5.9) million during 2010, compared to $(0.3) million in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	The net increase in other (expense), net, of $5.6 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.6 million in forward currency contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments), an increase of $2.6 million in foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains, and a decrease of $0.4 million in other miscellaneous income, net.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for 2010 was based upon pre-tax income of $28.3 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $26.1 million for 2009 based upon pre-tax income of $70.8 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The effective tax rate was 7.8% for 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 36.9% for 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate of 29.1% resulted primarily from the proportionately higher income under tax holiday jurisdictions, the foreign tax rate differential, a favorable change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable settlement of a tax audit, expiring statutes of limitation and tax benefits related to the ICT legal entity reorganization, and the absence of an unfavorable impact related to the $85.0 million change of intent to repatriate foreign earnings in 2009, partially offset by the lack of a release of valuation allowances and a higher proportion of withholding taxes in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On December 17, 2010 the Tax Relief Act was enacted.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Included in the Tax Relief Act is the extension until December 31, 2011 of Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a result of this extension, we changed our intent to distribute current earnings from various foreign operations to their foreign parents.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	These tax provisions permit continued tax deferral on such distributions that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the United States.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	While the distributions are not taxable in the United States, related withholding taxes of $1.7 million are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief Act, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	(Loss) from Discontinued Operations In November 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our Spanish operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Also, in December 2010, we sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Accordingly, we have reflected the operating results related to these operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	The (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $(12.9) million and $(1.5) million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S6	The (loss) on sale, net of taxes, of the Argentine operations totaled $(23.5) million for 2010 (none in 2009).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S7	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2010 of $38.0 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P37_S8	This decrease was principally attributable to a $233.7 million increase in direct salaries and related costs, a $152.3 million increase in general and administrative costs and a $3.3 million impairment of long-lived assets, partially offset by a $352.5 million increase in revenues, a $2.0 million net gain on insurance settlement, a decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangibles of $1.5 million and a $0.1 million decrease in net loss on disposal of property and equipment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	impairment loss on investment in SHPS in 2009 and a $23.9 million lower tax provision, resulting in a net loss of $10.3 million for 2010, a decrease of $53.5 million compared to 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results from continuing operations for 2011 and 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	During 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our operations in Spain.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Also, we sold our Argentine operations during 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect these results as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205-20 Discontinued Operations .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	(1) The amounts for each of the quarters include the results of ICT as a result of the acquisition completed on February 2, 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	(5) The quarter ended June 30, 2011 includes a $3.7 million net gain on sale of the land and building located in Minot, North Dakota.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	(6) The quarters ended September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010, and March 31, 2010 include interest and amortization of deferred loan fees related to the $75 million Term Loan, the $75 million revolving credit facility and the $75 million Bermuda Credit Agreement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Term Loan and the Bermuda Credit Agreement were paid off in September 2010 and March 2010, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	See Note 20, Borrowings, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	(7) The amounts for each of the quarters for 2011 and 2010 include the results of our operations in Spain.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The amounts for each of the quarters in 2010 include the results of our Argentine operations, which was sold in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	(9) Net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	On August 5, 2002, our Board authorized us to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2002 Share Repurchase Program ) and on August 18, 2011, our Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	During 2011, we repurchased a total of 3.3 million shares of common stock under these plans.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	During 2011, we repurchased 0.8 million common shares under the 2002 Share Repurchase Program at prices ranging from $12.46 to $18.53 per share for a total cost of $12.3 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S6	During 2010, we repurchased 0.3 million common shares at prices ranging from $16.92 to $17.60 per share for a total cost of $5.2 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P46_S7	During 2009, we repurchased 0.2 million common shares at prices ranging from $13.72 to $14.75 per share for a total cost of $3.2 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	All available shares under the 2002 Share Repurchase Program have been repurchased.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	During 2011, we repurchased 2.5 million common shares under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program at prices ranging from $14.18 to $16.10 per share for a total cost of $37.7 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price and general market conditions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	We may make additional discretionary stock repurchases under this program in 2012.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	During 2011, cash increased $102.6 million from operating activities, proceeds from sale of property and equipment of $4.0 million, proceeds from an insurance settlement of $1.7 million and proceeds from issuance of stock of $0.3 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	Further, we used $50.0 million on the repurchase of our stock, $29.9 million for capital expenditures, $1.2 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, $0.2 million to refund grants and $0.1 million investment in restricted cash resulting in a $21.3 million increase in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of $5.9 million).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2011 were $102.6 million, compared to $45.1 million provided by operating activities for 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The $57.5 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a $58.6 million increase in net income and a net increase of $15.0 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $16.1 million decrease in non-cash reconciling items such as the loss on sale of discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, net gain on disposal of property and equipment, impairment charges, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and stock-based compensation.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	The $15.0 million increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $19.6 million decrease in receivables, a $4.0 million increase in deferred revenue and a $1.7 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in other liabilities and a $4.3 million increase in other assets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	The increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities primarily relates to the timing of receivables billings and subsequent payments of those billings, coupled with a reduction in revenues in the fourth quarter in 2011 over the comparable period in 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	During 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our operations in Spain.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	During 2010, we sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Cash flows from discontinued operations were as follows (in millions):
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	Cash provided by (used for) operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash provided by (used for) the Spanish and Argentine operations in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations represents capital expenditures in 2011 and 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S5	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations in 2010 primarily represents cash on the balance sheet of the Argentine operations at the time of the sale.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S6	The sale of the Argentine operations resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29.9 million, or a $23.5 million loss, net of tax.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P49_S7	We do not expect the absence of the cash flows from our discontinued operations in Spain to materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $29.9 million for 2011, compared to $28.5 million for 2010, an increase of $1.4 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $33.0 million to $35.0 million, primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	On February 2, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for a $75 million revolving credit facility, which is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the Credit Agreement and had no outstanding borrowings under the facility.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The $75 million revolving credit facility provided under the Credit Agreement includes a $40 million multi-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $5 million letter of credit sub-facility, which may be used for general corporate purposes including strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support, and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the revolving credit facility, if necessary.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The revolving credit facility will mature on February 1, 2013.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The applicable interest rate is determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest established by KeyBank, from time to time, as its prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate in effect from time to time, plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; and (iii) the then-applicable LIBOR rate for one month interest periods, plus 1.00%.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	Swingline loans bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of up to 0.75%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the revolving credit facility.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S5	The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S6	As of December 31, 2011, we had $211.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 77.6% or $163.9 million, was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S7	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S8	We believe that our current cash levels, accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows generated from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, any future debt repayment requirements, continued expansion objectives, funding of potential acquisitions, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next twelve months and any stock repurchases.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P53_S9	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	At December 31, 2011, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2011, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our operating leases as discussed in Note 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	(2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits (See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements), which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	(4) Other accrued expenses and current liabilities, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts as disclosed in Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	(5) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $12.2 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	(6) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals (primarily lease obligations) and pension obligations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	See Notes 4 and 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call or per transaction basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 ( ASC 605-25 ) Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , revenue from contracts with multiple-deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value, if the deliverables in the contract(s) meet the criteria for such treatment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Separation criteria includes whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item, whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis, which generally consists of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	If there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service, revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	If there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service, the contract(s) is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	We recognize revenues for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known, uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved, and there are no client-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	Once we determine the allocation of revenues between deliverable elements, there are no further changes in the revenue allocation.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S5	If the separation criteria are met, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S6	If the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables, all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S7	For deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value, revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S8	As of December 31, 2011, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P68_S9	We have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board amended the accounting standards for certain multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originated or materially modified since January 1, 2011, the adoption date.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	Since there were no such transactions executed or materially modified since adoption on January 1, 2011, there was no impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $4.3 million as of December 31, 2011, or 1.9% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $38.5 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $4.7 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $33.8 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $22.8 million as of December 31, 2011 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2011, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $333.1 million as of December 31, 2011, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	If these earnings are repatriated or otherwise become taxable in the U.S, we would be subject to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2013 Revenue Proposals in February 2012.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P80_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had $17.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $3.9 million from $21.0 million as of December 31, 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	This decrease results primarily from the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and the resolution of a tax audit in the current year.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $17.1 million and $21.0 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S3	We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $0.6 million due to expiration of statutes of limitations, audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S4	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S5	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S6	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 through 2023.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P81_S7	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets, which had a carrying value of $256.9 million as of December 31, 2011, including goodwill, intangibles and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired, we would record an impairment charge, or loss, to reduce the asset to its fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-04 ( ASU 2011-04 ) Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	Some of the amendments clarify the FASB s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	Other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P84_S5	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 are to be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-04 as of January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-05 require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	The amendments in ASU 2011-05 are to be applied retrospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and may be early adopted.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	As this standard impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2011-05 as of January 1, 2012 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The amendments in ASU 2011-08 provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	Under the amendments in ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S5	An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P88_S6	The amendments in ASU 2011-08 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and may be early adopted.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 as of January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11 ( ASU 2011-11 ) Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset (netting assets and liabilities) in accordance with Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-11 to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 ( ASU 2011-12 ) Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 .
1010612_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 defer the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 are effective at the same time as ASU 2011-05 so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU 2011-05 that ASU 2011-05 is deferring.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	As ASU 2011-12 impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2011-12 as of January 1, 2012 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Acts ).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future, thus adversely affecting our profitability.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Acts, if any, on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	Preliminary analyses indicate that the increased cost of providing healthcare benefits in the future may not materially affect our profitability; however, there are many provisions of the Acts that have yet to be defined and which may be affected by the 2012 national elections.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P93_S4	The effect on our healthcare costs in the future may not be known for some time.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Movements in non-U.S. Dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Option and forward derivative contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables, and other transactions initiated in the United States, that are denominated in a foreign currency.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	Additionally, we may employ FX contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in The Philippines, Canada and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ), Canadian Dollars ( CAD ) and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	with notional amounts totaling $127.5 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of $0.2 million, which will settle within the next 12 months.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $9.3 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of these derivatives was a net payable of $0.3 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2011, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $2.6 million.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P99_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P100_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we had no debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are located beginning on page 58 and page 39 of this report, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

1010612_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P106_S3	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P106_S4	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P106_S5	This report appears on page 50.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P108_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_12_ITEM7_P109_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P82_S8	See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for additional information on the sale of the Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of SYKES and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Subsequent Events Subsequent events or transactions have been evaluated through the date and time of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call or per transaction basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 ( ASC 605-25 ) Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , revenue from contracts with multiple-deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value, if the deliverables in the contract(s) meet the criteria for such treatment.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	Separation criteria includes whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item, whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	Fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis, which generally consists of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	If there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service, revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	If there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service, the contract(s) is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	We recognize revenues for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known, uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved, and there are no client-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S4	Once we determine the allocation of revenues between deliverable elements, there are no further changes in the revenue allocation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S5	If the separation criteria are met, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S6	If the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables, all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S7	For deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value, revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S8	As of December 31, 2011, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P89_S9	We have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board amended the accounting standards for certain multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originated or materially modified since January 1, 2011, the adoption date.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	Since there were no such transactions executed or materially modified since adoption on January 1, 2011, there was no impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	Cash in the amount of $211.1 million and $189.8 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was primarily held in interest bearing investments, which have original maturities of less than 90 days.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade account receivables for estimated losses arising from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The Company s estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain clients, historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale The Company classifies its assets and related liabilities as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the assets, the assets are ready for immediate sale in their present condition, an active program to locate buyers and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets has been initiated, the sale of the assets is probable and expected to be completed within one year, the assets are marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Company measures the value of assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	Assets and the related liabilities held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 pertain to the applicable assets and liabilities of the Company s Spanish operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P95_S3	See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for additional information.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	Cost and related accumulated depreciation on assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred, if any, to internally develop software upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows (the reporting unit ).
1010612_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P99_S3	Occasionally, the Company redeploys property and equipment from under-utilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the under-utilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P99_S4	Except as discussed in Note 5, Fair Value, the Company determined that its property and equipment were not impaired as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Rent Expense The Company has entered into operating lease agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases, rent free periods, or periods in which rent payments are reduced.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The total amount of the rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC 840 Leases.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Investment in SHPS The Company held a noncontrolling interest in SHPS, Inc. ( SHPS ), which was accounted for at cost of approximately $2.1 million as of December 31, 2008.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	In June 2009, the Company received notice from SHPS that the shareholders of SHPS had approved a merger agreement between SHPS and SHPS Acquisition, Inc., pursuant to which the common stock of SHPS, including the common stock owned by the Company, would be converted into the right to receive $0.000001 per share in cash.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P101_S2	SHPS informed the Company that it believed the estimated fair value of the SHPS common stock to be equal to such per share amount.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P101_S3	As a result of this transaction and evaluation of the Company s legal options, the Company believed it was more likely than not that it would not be able to recover the $2.1 million carrying value of the investment in SHPS.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	Impairment loss on investment in SHPS during 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Subsequent to the recording of the impairment loss, the Company liquidated its noncontrolling interest in SHPS by converting its SHPS common stock into cash for $0.000001 per share during 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	Investments Held in Rabbi Trust for Former ICT Chief Executive Officer Securities held in a rabbi trust for a nonqualified plan trust agreement dated February 1, 2010 (the Trust Agreement ) with respect to severance payable to John Brennan, the former chief executive officer of ICT, include the fair market value of debt securities, primarily United States ( U.S. ) Treasury Bills.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	See Note 13, Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts, for further information.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	The fair market value of these debt securities, classified as trading securities in accordance with ASC 320 Investment Debt and Equity Securities , is determined by quoted market prices and is adjusted to the current market price at the end of each reporting period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	The net realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, which are included in Other income and expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, are not material for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	For purposes of determining realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on specific identification.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	The Accrued employee compensation and benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 includes a $0.1 million obligation for severance payable to the former executive due in varying installments in accordance with the Trust Agreement.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired goodwill over an indefinite period of time.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization, but instead must be reviewed at least annually, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances, for impairment by applying a fair value based test.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	Fair value for goodwill is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate, and an analysis of our market capitalization.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Under ASC 350, the carrying value of assets is calculated at the reporting unit.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the three months ended September 30, 2011, which included the consideration of certain economic factors and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired, except as discussed in Note 5, Fair Value.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, trade names, existing technologies and covenants not to compete, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or changes in circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	Fair value for intangible assets is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values as appropriate.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	The Company does not have intangible assets with indefinite lives.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	See Note 5, Fair Value, for further information regarding the impairment of intangible assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	The Philippine operations are subject to value added tax ( VAT ) which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased throughout The Philippines.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	Upon validation and certification of the VAT receivables by the Philippine government, the resulting value added tax certificates ( certificates ) can be either used to offset current tax obligations or offered for sale to the Philippine government.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	The Philippine government previously allowed companies to sell the certificates to third parties, but this option was eliminated during the three months ended September 30, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	The VAT receivables balance is recorded at its net realizable value.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Income Taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with the criteria of ASC 740.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets due to an uncertainty of realization.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P112_S2	Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence, in accordance with criteria of ASC 740, to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in its tax returns, and records a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company self-insures for certain levels of workers compensation and, as of January 1, 2011, began self-funding the medical, prescription drug and dental benefit plans in the United States.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	Estimated costs of this self-insurance program are accrued at the projected settlements for known and anticipated claims.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	Amounts related to this self-insurance program are included in Accrued employee compensation and benefits and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment (together, property grants ) is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense included within general and administrative costs over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	Amounts received in excess of the cost of the building are allocated to the cost of equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P118_S3	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company receives government employment grants as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a specified time period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	The grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P119_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized using the proportionate performance model over the required employment period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P120_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from 30 days to seven years.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P120_S2	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over the next ensuing twelve month period and the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P120_S3	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the 2004 Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P121_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, common stock units, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company issues common stock and treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	In accordance with ASC 718 ( ASC 718 ) Compensation Stock Compensation , the Company recognizes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trusts and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	Forward Currency Forward Contracts and Options Forward currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	ASC 825 ( ASC 825 ) Financial Instruments permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P128_S2	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	Determination of Fair Value - The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P133_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Money Market and Open-End Mutual Funds - The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of money market and open-end mutual funds, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options - The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over the counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P136_S3	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts The investment assets of the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 13, Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts, and Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Guaranteed Investment Certificates Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company generally utilizes non-deliverable forward contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P140_S2	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S3	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S4	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S5	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S6	All changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Other income (expense) .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P147_S7	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, for further information on financial derivative instruments.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-04 ( ASU 2011-04 ) Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S2	Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S3	Some of the amendments clarify the FASB s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S4	Other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P148_S5	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 are to be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-04 as of January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-05 require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P150_S3	The amendments in ASU 2011-05 are to be applied retrospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and may be early adopted.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P150_S4	As this standard impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2011-05 as of January 1, 2012 did not impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The amendments in ASU 2011-08 provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S4	Under the amendments in ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S5	An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P152_S6	The amendments in ASU 2011-08 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and may be early adopted.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 as of January 1, 2012 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-11 to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 ( ASU 2011-12 ) Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 .
1010612_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 defer the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P158_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 are effective at the same time as ASU 2011-05 so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU 2011-05 that ASU 2011-05 is deferring.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P158_S3	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P158_S4	As ASU 2011-12 impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2011-12 as of January 1, 2012 did not impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	The above fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	The measurement period adjustments relate primarily to unrecognized tax benefits and related offsets, tax liabilities relating to the determination as of the date of the ICT acquisition that the Company intended to distribute a majority of the accumulated and undistributed earnings of the ICT Philippine subsidiary and its direct parent, ICT Group Netherlands B.V. to SYKES, its ultimate U.S. parent, and certain accrual adjustments related to labor and benefit costs in Argentina.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S3	The $97.8 million of goodwill was assigned to the Company s Americas and EMEA operating segments in the amount of $97.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S4	The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to synergies the Company expects to achieve as the acquisition increases the opportunity for sustained long-term operating margin expansion by leveraging general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S5	Pursuant to federal income tax regulations, the ICT acquisition was considered to be a non-taxable transaction; therefore, no amount of intangibles or goodwill from this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P164_S6	The fair value of receivables acquired was $75.9 million, with the gross contractual amount being $76.4 million, of which $0.5 million was not expected to be collected.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P168_S4	The pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and related borrowings had taken place on January 1, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1010612_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	These amounts have been calculated to reflect the additional depreciation, amortization, and interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the fair value adjustments and borrowings occurred on January 1, 2010, together with the consequential tax effects.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	In addition, these amounts exclude costs incurred which are directly attributable to the acquisition, and which do not have a continuing impact on the combined companies operating results.

( CIMSA ) and ICT Services of Argentina, S.A. ( ICT Argentina ), together the Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	through a total of three centers in Argentina to clients in the United States and in the Republic of Argentina.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P181_S1	The decision to exit Argentina was made due to surging costs, primarily chronic wage increases, which dramatically reduced the appeal of the Argentina footprint among the Company s existing and new global clients and thus the overall future profitability of the Argentine operations.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	On December 13, 2010, the Company entered a stock purchase agreement, and pursuant thereto, the Company sold all of the shares of capital stock of CIMSA to individual purchasers for a nominal price.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P182_S1	Pursuant to the CIMSA stock purchase agreement, immediately prior to closing, the Company made a capital contribution of $9.5 million to CIMSA to cover a portion of CIMSA s liabilities.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P182_S2	Immediately after closing, the purchasers made a capital contribution to CIMSA of $1.0 million, and CIMSA repaid a loan of $1.0 million to one of the Company s subsidiaries.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P182_S3	As this was a stock transaction, the Company has no future obligation with regard to CIMSA and there are no material post closing obligations.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P281_S1	Accordingly, a net deferred tax provision of $14.7 million was recorded in 2009.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P281_S2	Of the $85.0 million change of intent, $50.0 million was distributed in 2010 and the remaining $35.0 million was distributed in 2011 and the related deferred tax liability was realized.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P282_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P282_S2	The Company has been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador and India.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P282_S3	The tax holidays have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 through 2023.

1010612_12_ITEM15_P284_S1	This decrease results primarily from the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and the resolution of a tax audit in the current year.
1010612_12_ITEM15_P284_S2	Had the Company recognized these tax benefits, approximately $17.1 million and $21.0 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table summarizes our revenues for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain amounts and percentages of revenues for the periods indicated, by reporting segment (in thousands):
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	2012 Compared to 2011 Revenues For 2012, we recognized consolidated revenues of $1,127.7 million, a decrease of $41.6 million or 3.6%, from $1,169.3 million in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	On a geographic segment basis, revenues from the Americas region, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 84.0%, or $947.1 million, for 2012 compared to 82.4%, or $963.1 million, in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa, represented 16.0%, or $180.6 million, for 2012 compared to 17.6%, or $206.2 million, in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Americas revenues decreased $16.0 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $0.5 million, for 2012 from 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	The remaining decrease of $16.5 million was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $85.9 million and lower volumes from existing contracts of $35.7 million, partially offset by new contract sales of $64.5 million and Alpine acquisition revenues of $40.6 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.1% of Americas revenues, compared to 47.8% in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S6	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P8_S7	We weight these factors in our continual focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	EMEA s revenues decreased $25.6 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $11.7 million, for 2012 from 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The remaining decrease of $13.9 million was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $32.7 million and lower volumes from existing contracts of $0.5 million, partially offset by new contract sales of $19.3 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	On a consolidated basis, we had 39,300 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2012, a decrease of 2,000 seats from 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis was 75% compared to 73% in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	This increase was primarily due to seat rationalizations associated with the strategic actions in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan (see Note 5, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	On a geographic segment basis, 34,000 seats were located in the Americas, a decrease of 1,500 seats from 2011, and 5,300 seats were located in EMEA, a decrease of 500 seats from 2011.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S9	The Company plans to add approximately 6,000 seats on a gross basis in 2013.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S10	Approximately 75% of the seat count is expected to be added in the first half of 2013, with the remainder in the second half.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P9_S11	Total seat count on a net basis for the full year, however, is expected to increase by approximately 1,000 seats.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million for 2012 from 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	This increase of $4.8 million was primarily attributable to higher merger and acquisition costs of $2.9 million, higher compensation costs of $1.5 million, higher legal and professional fees of $1.1 million, higher software maintenance costs of $0.3 million and higher other costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower charitable contributions of $1.2 million.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S12	The gain in 2011 primarily related to the sale of land and a building located in Minot, North Dakota.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S13	Net (Gain) on Insurance Settlement Net (gain) on insurance settlement of $(0.1) million in 2012 primarily relates to funds received for damage to our building and contents as a result of a tornado at one of our customer contact management centers located in Ponca City, Oklahoma.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S14	Net (gain) on insurance settlement of $(0.5) million in 2011 primarily relates to funds received for flood damage from Typhoon Ondoy to the building and contents of one of our customer contact management centers located in Marikina City, The Philippines (acquired as part of the ICT acquisition).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S15	The damaged property and equipment had been written down by ICT prior to the ICT acquisition in February 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P10_S16	No additional funds are expected related to either of these insurance claims.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase of $0.5 million reflects interest and fees on borrowings related to the August 2012 acquisition of Alpine.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Other (Expense) Other (expense), net, was $(2.5) million for 2012, compared to $(2.1) million in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	The net increase in other (expense), net, of $0.4 million was primarily attributable to a $2.1 million increase in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains and a $0.6 million loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in foreign currency forward contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments) and an increase of $1.1 million in other miscellaneous income, net.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	Other (expense), net, excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The provision for income taxes of $5.2 million for 2012 was based upon pre-tax income of $45.2 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $11.3 million for 2011, which was based upon pre-tax income of $63.7 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The effective tax rate was 11.5% for 2012, compared to an effective tax rate of 17.8% for 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate of 6.3% resulted primarily from integration and transaction costs related to the Alpine acquisition, which lowered income in a high tax jurisdiction.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.8 million and $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	In 2011, the net gain on sale of the Argentine discontinued operations totaled $0.5 million, which resulted from the reversal of the accrued liability related to the expiration of the indemnification to the purchaser for the possible loss of a specific client business.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	There was no tax impact on either the (loss) from discontinued operations or the gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2012 of $47.8 million, a decrease of $17.8 million from 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S7	This decrease was principally attributable to a $41.6 million decrease in revenues, a $3.4 million decrease in net gain on disposal of property and equipment and a $0.4 million decrease in net gain on insurance settlement, partially offset by a $26.0 million decrease in direct salaries and related costs, a $0.3 million decrease in general and administrative costs and a $1.3 million decrease in impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P15_S8	In addition to the $17.8 million decrease in income from continuing operations, we experienced an increase of $0.5 million in interest expense, a $0.4 million increase in other expense, net, and a $11.2 million increase in loss on sale of discontinued operations, partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in loss from discontinued operations and a $6.1 million decrease in the tax provision, resulting in net income of $28.4 million for 2012, a decrease of $20.0 million compared to 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	2011 Compared to 2010 Revenues For 2011, we recognized consolidated revenues of $1,169.3 million, an increase of $47.4 million or 4.2%, from $1,121.9 million in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	On a geographic segment basis, revenues from the Americas region, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim, represented 82.4%, or $963.1 million, for 2011 compared to 83.3%, or $934.3 million, in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Revenues from the EMEA region, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa, represented 17.6%, or $206.2 million, for 2011 compared to 16.7%, or $187.6 million, in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Americas revenues increased $28.8 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $10.8 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The remaining increase of $18.0 million was primarily due to new contract sales of $65.9 million and higher volumes from existing contracts of $8.0 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $55.9 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.8% of Americas revenues, compared to 47.7% in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	We weight these factors in our focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	EMEA s revenues increased $18.6 million, including the positive foreign currency impact of $9.9 million, for 2011 from 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The remaining increase of $8.7 million was primarily due to new contract sales of $15.0 million and higher volumes from existing contracts of $22.2 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $28.5 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	This $8.7 million increase is net of a $1.2 million decrease in revenues due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2010 Exit Plan.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Direct Salaries and Related Costs Direct salaries and related costs increased $48.4 million, or 6.7%, to $763.9 million for 2011 from $715.5 million in 2010.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	This increase of 1.3%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.4% (principally related to lower volumes within certain existing clients without a commensurate reduction in labor costs) and higher other costs of 0.1%, partially offset by lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, direct salaries and related costs increased to 73.8% for 2011 from 71.9% in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S9	This increase of 1.9%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher severance costs of 0.7% due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, higher compensation costs of 0.6%, higher fulfillment shipping material costs of 0.4%, higher communication costs of 0.2%, higher automobile-related costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.1%, partially offset by lower travel costs of 0.3%.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S10	General and Administrative General and administrative expenses decreased $25.0 million, or 6.8%, to $341.6 million for 2011 from $366.6 million in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P17_S11	On a reporting segment basis, general and administrative expenses from the Americas segment decreased $6.3 million, including the negative foreign currency impact of $5.3 million, for 2011 from 2010.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	This decrease of $18.2 million was primarily attributable to lower merger and acquisition costs of $22.9 million, partially offset by higher legal and professional fees of $1.4 million, higher charitable contributions of $1.3 million, higher software maintenance of $0.6 million, higher compensation costs of $0.6 million, higher consulting costs of $0.2 million, higher training costs of $0.2 million and higher other costs of $0.4 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	In the Americas segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.7% for 2011 from 26.1% in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	This decrease of 1.4%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower merger and acquisition costs of 0.9%, lower depreciation of 0.3% and lower other taxes of 0.2%.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P18_S5	In the EMEA segment, as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 27.8% for 2011 from 30.8% in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P18_S6	This decrease of 3.0%, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.2%, lower merger and acquisition costs of 1.0%, lower facility-related costs of 0.6%, lower travel costs of 0.3%, lower legal and professional fees of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.4%, partially offset by higher severance costs of 0.8% primarily due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net (Gain) Loss on Disposal of Property and Equipment Net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment was $(3.0) million during 2011, primarily due to the gain on the sale of land and a building located in Minot, North Dakota.

1010612_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	The damaged property and equipment had been written down by ICT prior to the ICT acquisition in February 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles We make certain estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions and projections of cash flows, investment rates and cost of capital and growth rates when estimating the value of our intangibles.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Based on actual and forecasted operating results and deterioration of the related customer base in our ICT-acquired United Kingdom operations, the EMEA segment recorded a $0.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangibles, primarily customer relationships, during 2010 (none in 2011).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets During 2011, we recorded a $1.7 million impairment of long-lived assets, consisting of $1.2 million in the Americas segment and $0.5 million in the EMEA segment.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	During 2010, we recorded a $3.3 million impairment of long-lived assets, consisting of $3.1 million in the Americas segment and $0.2 million in the EMEA segment.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Interest Income Interest income was $1.4 million for 2011, compared to $1.2 million in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The increase of $0.2 million reflects higher average balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	Interest (Expense) Interest (expense) was $(1.1) million for 2011, compared to $(4.9) million in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	The decrease of $3.8 million reflects interest and fees on higher average levels of borrowings in 2010 related to the ICT acquisition.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Other (Expense) Other (expense), net, was $(2.1) million for 2011, compared to $(5.9) million in 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The net decrease in other (expense), net, of $3.8 million was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.1 million in forward currency contract losses (which were not designated as hedging instruments) and a decrease of $1.4 million in foreign currency transaction losses, net of gains, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in other miscellaneous income, net.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The provision for income taxes of $11.3 million for 2011 was based upon pre-tax income of $63.7 million, compared to the provision for income taxes of $2.2 million for 2010 based upon pre-tax income of $28.3 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The effective tax rate was 17.8% for 2011, compared to an effective tax rate of 7.8% for 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	The increase in the effective tax rate of 10.0% resulted primarily from the shift of earnings to higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a favorable foreign tax rate differential, changes in uncertain tax positions due to the favorable settlements of tax audits and expiring statutes of limitation, in conjunction with 2010 tax benefits related to the ICT legal entity reorganization.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	On December 17, 2010 the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Tax Relief Act ) was enacted.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Included in the Tax Relief Act was the extension until December 31, 2011 of Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result of this extension, we changed our intent to distribute current earnings from various foreign operations to their foreign parents.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	These tax provisions permitted continued tax deferral through 2011 on such distributions that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the United States.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	While the distributions are not taxable in the United States, related withholding taxes of $2.7 million are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief Act, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	(Loss) from Discontinued Operations In November 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our Spanish operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	Also, in December 2010, we sold our Argentine operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Accordingly, we have reflected the operating results related to these operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	The (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $(4.6) million and $(12.9) million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	The gain (loss) on sale, net of taxes, of the Argentine operations totaled $0.5 million and $(23.5) million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S7	The gain on sale during 2011 resulted from the reversal of the accrued liability related to the expiration of the indemnification to the purchaser for the possible loss of a specific client business.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S8	As a result of the foregoing, we reported income from continuing operations for 2011 of $65.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million from 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S9	This increase was principally attributable to a $47.4 million increase in revenues, a $25.0 million decrease in general and administrative costs, a $3.1 million increase in net gain on disposal of property and equipment, a $1.6 million decrease in impairment of long-lived assets and a $0.4 million decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangibles, partially offset by a $48.4 million increase in direct salaries and related costs and a $1.5 million decrease in net gain on insurance settlement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P26_S10	In addition to the $27.6 million increase in income from continuing operations, we experienced a $3.8 million decrease in other expense, net, a $3.8 million decrease in interest expense, a $0.2 million increase in interest income, a $8.3 million decrease in loss from discontinued operations and a $24.0 million decrease in loss on sale of discontinued operations, partially offset by a $9.1 million increase in the tax provision, resulting in net income of $48.3 million for 2011, an increase of $58.6 million compared to 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results from continuing operations for 2012 and 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	During 2012, we sold our operations in Spain.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	Accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect these results as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205-20 Discontinued Operations .
1010612_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	(5) The quarter ended June 30, 2011 includes a $3.7 million net gain on sale of the land and building located in Minot, North Dakota.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	(8) Net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Business Outlook For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions or share repurchase activities.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	On August 18, 2011, our Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	During 2012, we repurchased 0.5 million common shares under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program at prices ranging from $13.85 to $15.00 per share for a total cost of $7.9 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	During 2011, we repurchased 2.5 million common shares under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program at prices ranging from $14.18 to $16.10 per share for a total cost of $37.7 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2012, a total of 3.0 million shares have been repurchased under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S5	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P33_S6	We may make additional discretionary stock repurchases under this program in 2013.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	On August 5, 2002, our Board authorized us to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2002 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	During 2011, we repurchased 0.8 million common shares under the 2002 Share Repurchase Program at prices ranging from $12.46 to $18.53 per share for a total cost of $12.3 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	During 2010, we repurchased 0.3 million common shares at prices ranging from $16.92 to $17.60 per share for a total cost of $5.2 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	All available shares under the 2002 Share Repurchase Program have been repurchased.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	During 2012, cash increased $86.5 million from operating activities, $113.0 million due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $0.4 million due to a release of restricted cash, $0.2 million from the proceeds from sale of property and equipment and $0.2 million of other.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	Further, we paid $147.1 million for the Alpine acquisition, used $38.6 million for capital expenditures, used $22.0 million to repay long-term debt, divested cash of $9.1 million in conjunction with the sale of discontinued operations in Spain, used $7.9 million to repurchase our stock, used $1.4 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards and paid $0.9 million for loan fees, resulting in a $23.8 million decrease in available cash (including the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $2.9 million).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2012 were $86.5 million, compared to $102.6 million in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	The $16.1 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a $20.0 million decrease in net income and a net decrease of $1.2 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on the sale of discontinued operations, net (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P35_S5	The $1.2 million decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $15.7 million increase in accounts receivable (primarily related to the timing of receivables billings and subsequent payments of those billings, coupled with a reduction in revenues in 2012 over 2011), a $13.1 million increase in other assets (primarily related to the payment of a mandatory security deposit in connection with a Canadian tax audit) and a $4.4 million decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in other liabilities (primarily related to the timing of payments and an increase in customer deposits of $6.6 million) and a $6.0 million increase in taxes payable.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We sold our operations in Spain and Argentina in 2012 and 2010, respectively.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Cash flows from discontinued operations, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were as follows (in thousands): Cash (used for) operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash (used for) the Spanish and Argentine operations in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations for 2012 and 2010 primarily represents the cash divested upon the sale of the Spanish and Argentine operations, respectively.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations represents capital expenditures in 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	The sale of the Spanish operations resulted in a loss of $10.7 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	The sale of the Argentine operations resulted in a pre-tax loss of $29.9 million, or a $23.5 million loss, net of tax.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S6	We do not expect the absence of the cash flows from our discontinued operations in Spain and Argentina to materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S7	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $38.6 million for 2012, compared to $29.9 million for 2011, an increase of $8.7 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P36_S8	In 2013, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $55.0 million to $65.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	On May 3, 2012, we entered into a $245 million revolving credit facility (the 2012 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent ( KeyBank ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The 2012 Credit Agreement replaced our previous $75 million revolving credit facility dated February 2, 2010, as amended, which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The 2012 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2012 Credit Agreement and had $91.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility, with an average daily utilization of $96.8 million for the outstanding period during 2012 (none in 2011).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	During 2012 and 2010, the related interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred loan fees, under our credit agreements was $0.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 1.5% and 3.9%, respectively (none in 2011).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	The 2012 Credit Agreement includes a $184 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2012 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	The 2012 Credit Agreement will mature on May 2, 2017.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S7	Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P38_S8	The applicable interest rate will be determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	The base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest established by KeyBank, from time to time, as its prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate in effect from time to time, plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; and (iii) the then-applicable LIBOR rate for one month interest periods, plus 1.00%.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Swingline loans will bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.175%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The 2012 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	In April 2012, we received an assessment for the Canadian 2003-2006 audit for which we filed a Notice of Objection in July 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	As required by the Notice of Objection process, we paid mandatory security deposits in the amount of $14.5 million to the Canadian Revenue Agency and $0.4 million to the Province of Ontario.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	This process will allow us to submit the case to the U.S. and Canada Competent Authority for ultimate resolution.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	audit and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	On August 20, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 27, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The purchase price of $149.0 million was funded through cash on hand of $41.0 million and borrowings of $108.0 million under our 2012 Credit Agreement, dated May 3, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had $187.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 97.6% or $182.9 million, was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	These funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	We do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We expect our current domestic cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our domestic anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Additionally, we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	If we should require more cash in the U.S. than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and/or raise capital in the U.S through additional borrowings or debt/equity issuances.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, interest expense and/or dilution of earnings.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	At December 31, 2012, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2012, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	(2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits (See Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements), which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilities, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts as disclosed in Note 19 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	(6) Long-term debt (See Note 21 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements), which represents borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	(7) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The amount in the table has been reduced by $14.9 million of Canadian mandatory security deposits paid during 2012, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $10.4 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals (primarily lease obligations) and pension obligations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	See Notes 5 and 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.5% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ) (as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ) ( ASU 2009-13 ), we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Once we allocate revenue to each deliverable, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2012, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, we have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $5.1 million as of December 31, 2012, or 2.0% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $43.3 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $3.5 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $39.8 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $17.3 million as of December 31, 2012 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2012, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $383.8 million as of December 31, 2012, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	In April 2012, we received an assessment for the Canadian 2003-2006 audit for which we filed a Notice of Objection in July 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	As required by the Notice of Objection process, we paid mandatory security deposits in the amount of $14.5 million to the Canadian Revenue Agency and $0.4 million to the Province of Ontario, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 and Cash paid during period for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	This process will allow us to submit the case to the U.S. and Canada Competent Authority for ultimate resolution.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain, we believe we are adequately reserved for this audit and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2013 Revenue Proposals in February 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	In addition, The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was passed on January 2, 2013, with many provisions retroactively effective to January 1, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	We are currently evaluating the net retroactive impact of this law change on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	As of December 31, 2012, we had $16.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $0.2 million from $17.1 million as of December 31, 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S6	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $16.9 million and $17.1 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S7	We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $0.4 million due to expiration of statutes of limitations, audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S8	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S9	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S10	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2013 through 2023.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P74_S11	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired, we would record an impairment charge, or loss, to reduce the asset to its fair value.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2011-11 ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset (netting assets and liabilities) in accordance with Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-11 as of January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment ( ASU 2012-02 ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S4	Under the amendments in ASU 2012-02, an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S5	An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P79_S6	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-02 on January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2013-02 ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	However, the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S5	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P80_S6	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-02 to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Acts ).
1010612_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future, thus adversely affecting our profitability.
1010612_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Acts on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Movements in non-U.S. Dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Option and forward derivative contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables, and other transactions initiated in the United States, that are denominated in a foreign currency.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Additionally, we may employ FX contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in The Philippines, Canada and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ), Canadian Dollars, and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ), with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints ( HUF ) and Romanian Leis ( RON ).
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S5	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP, CRC, HUF and RON we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2012 with counterparties through January 2014 with notional amounts totaling $148.4 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S6	As of December 31, 2012, we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of $0.2 million, which will settle within the next 13 months.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S7	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP, CRC and the EUR was to weaken against the HUF and RON by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $11.9 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P3_S8	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of these derivatives was a net receivable of $0.9 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2012, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $5.3 million.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P4_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had $91.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2012, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $0.4 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are located beginning on page 56 and page 39 of this report, respectively.

1010612_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S6	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting, except for the change discussed under Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S7	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P11_S8	This report appears on page 49.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting On August 20, 2012, we acquired Alpine.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	We have excluded Alpine from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 as we are currently integrating policies, processes, people, technology and operations for the combined companies.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Management will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we execute our integration activities.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Alpine Access, Incorporated, which was acquired on August 20, 2012 and whose financial statements constituted 26% and 20% of net and total assets, respectively, 4% of revenues, and who contributed a net loss of $2.2 million to the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Alpine Access, Incorporated.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P13_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_13_ITEM7A_P14_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1010612_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Subsequent Events Subsequent events or transactions have been evaluated through the date and time of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Recognition of Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605 Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company primarily recognizes revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S4	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.5% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S5	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S6	[as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13 )], the Company determines if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S7	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S8	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P67_S9	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Estimated selling price is based on the Company s best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Once the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable, the Company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company s fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P70_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, the Company had no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	Cash in the amount of $187.3 million and $211.1 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was primarily held in interest bearing investments, which have original maturities of less than 90 days.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	Cash and cash equivalents of $182.9 million and $163.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes cash whereby the Company s ability to use the funds at any time is contractually limited or is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade account receivables for estimated losses arising from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company s estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of the Company s trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of the Company s clients.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale The Company classifies its assets and related liabilities as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the assets, the assets are ready for immediate sale in their present condition, an active program to locate buyers and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets has been initiated, the sale of the assets is probable and expected to be completed within one year, the assets are marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company measures the value of assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	Assets and the related liabilities held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 pertain to the applicable assets and liabilities of the Company s Spanish operations.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	See Note 4, Discontinued Operations, for additional information.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	Cost and related accumulated depreciation on assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred, if any, to internally develop software upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment .
1010612_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows (the reporting unit ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets or independent third party offers.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P79_S3	Occasionally, the Company redeploys property and equipment from under-utilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the under-utilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P79_S4	Except as discussed in Note 6, Fair Value, the Company determined that its property and equipment were not impaired as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company has entered into operating lease agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases, rent free periods, or periods in which rent payments are reduced.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The total amount of the rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC 840 Leases.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired goodwill over an indefinite period of time.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	For goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the third quarter, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P82_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Fair value for goodwill is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate, and an analysis of our market capitalization.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	Under ASC 350, the carrying value of assets is calculated at the reporting unit.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	The Company bypassed the option to first assess qualitative factors and completed its annual two-step goodwill impairment test during the three months ended September 30, 2012, which included the consideration of certain economic factors, and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	into account events or changes in circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	Fair value for intangible assets is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Philippine operations are subject to value added tax ( VAT ) which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased throughout The Philippines.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	Upon validation and certification of the VAT receivables by the Philippine government, the resulting value added tax certificates ( certificates ) can be either used to offset current tax obligations or offered for sale to the Philippine government.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Philippine government previously allowed companies to sell the certificates to third parties, but this option was eliminated during the three months ended September 30, 2011.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P88_S3	The VAT receivables balance is recorded at its net realizable value.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ) which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with the criteria of ASC 740.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets due to an uncertainty of realization.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P89_S3	Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence, in accordance with criteria of ASC 740, to support a change in judgment about the ability to realize the related deferred tax assets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in its tax returns, and records a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company self-insures for certain levels of workers compensation and, as of January 1, 2011, began self-funding the medical, prescription drug and dental benefit plans in the United States.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P93_S2	Estimated costs of this self-insurance program are accrued at the projected settlements for known and anticipated claims.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P93_S3	Amounts related to this self-insurance program are included in Accrued employee compensation and benefits and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment (together, property grants ) is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense included within general and administrative costs over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	Amounts received in excess of the cost of the building are allocated to the cost of equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company receives government employment grants as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a specified time period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P95_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized using the proportionate performance model over the required employment period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from 30 days to seven years.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the 2004 Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), both approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 27, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	The Company issues common stock and uses treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S4	In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company recognizes in its accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P98_S5	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trust and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options Foreign currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	ASC 825 Financial Instruments ( ASC 825 ) permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P103_S2	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P104_S2	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P104_S3	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Determination of Fair Value The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P108_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P108_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P109_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	Money Market and Open-End Mutual Funds The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of money market and open-end mutual funds, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over the counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	The investment assets of the rabbi trust are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 14, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, and Note 27, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Guaranteed Investment Certificates Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Foreign Currency and Derivative Instruments The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	The Company generally utilizes non-deliverable forward contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P116_S3	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, or if the Company de-designates a derivative as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S4	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S5	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S6	All changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Other income (expense) .
1010612_13_ITEM15_P123_S7	See Note 13, Financial Derivatives, for further information on financial derivative instruments.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2011-11 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset (netting assets and liabilities) in accordance with Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P124_S3	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-11 as of January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment ( ASU 2012-02 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S2	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S3	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S4	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S5	Under the amendments in ASU 2012-02, an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S6	An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P125_S7	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-02 on January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2013-02 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S2	However, the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S3	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S4	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S5	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P127_S6	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-02 to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued ASU 2011-04 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ( ASU 2011-04 ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-04 result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1010612_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P128_S3	Some of the amendments clarify the FASB s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements.

1010612_13_ITEM15_P290_S0	Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P290_S1	The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award.

1010612_13_ITEM15_P297_S2	The Company recognizes compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the fair value (which approximates the current market price) of the restricted shares (and RSUs) on the date of grant ratably over the requisite service period based on the probability of achieving the performance goals.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P297_S3	Changes in the probability of achieving the performance goals from period to period will result in corresponding changes in compensation expense.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P298_S0	The employment-based restricted shares currently outstanding vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the participant is employed by the Company on such date.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P298_S1	In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2011 Plan and 2001 Plan) prior to the date the restricted shares vest, all of the restricted shares will vest and the restrictions on transfer will lapse with respect to such vested shares on the date of the change in control, provided that participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.
1010612_13_ITEM15_P298_S2	If the participant s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, either by the Company or participant, prior to the date on which the restricted shares have vested and the restrictions have lapsed with respect to such vested shares, any restricted shares remaining subject to the restrictions (together with any dividends paid thereon) will be forfeited, unless there has been a change in control prior to such date.

SECTION 1350 In connection with the Annual Report of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, W.

1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about us, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words such as may, expects, projects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer contact management centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our clients products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	For these reasons, among others, if unfavorable economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 45.9% of our consolidated revenues in 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Cyber-attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is heavily dependent upon our computer and voice technologies, systems and platforms.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our call centers and impede our ability to provide critical services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	While we take measures to protect the security of, and unauthorized access to our systems, as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	While many companies provide outsourced customer contact management services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	There are numerous and varied providers of our services, including firms specializing in call center operations, temporary staffing and personnel placement, consulting and integration firms, and niche providers of outsourced customer contact management services, many of whom compete in only certain markets.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our competitors include both companies who possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer contact management services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S9	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S10	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer contact management services companies on price.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S11	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P4_S12	The concentration of customer support centers in certain geographies poses risks to our operations which could adversely affect our financial condition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Although we have call centers in many locations throughout the world, we have a concentration of centers in certain geographies outside of the U.S. and Canada, specifically The Philippines and Latin America.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our concentration of operations in those geographies is a result of our ability to access significant numbers of employees with certain language and other skills at costs that are advantageous.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	However, the concentration of business activities in any geographical area creates risks which could harm operations and our financial condition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Certain risks, such as natural disasters, armed conflict and military or civil unrest, political instability and disease transmission, as well as the risk of interruption to our delivery systems, is magnified when the realization of these, or any other risks, would effect a large portion of our business at once, which may result in a disproportionate increase in operating costs.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Regardless of the outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Significant capital expenditures may be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Emergency interruption of customer contact management center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer contact management centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers and, as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer contact centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer contact centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Some of our customer contact management centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P16_S11	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we maintain customer contact management centers, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer contact management centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The United States Congress has passed, and the President has signed into law, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ).
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including foreign currency and interest rate hedging transactions.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission to promulgate rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Until the rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act are established, we cannot know how these regulations will affect us.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The rules adopted by the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission may in the future impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges to reduce foreign exchange and interest rate uncertainty and thus protect cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act s new requirements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	It is possible that the costs of such compliance will be passed on to customers such as us.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	At December 31, 2013, our international operations were conducted from 33 customer contact management centers located in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Egypt, Scotland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India and Australia.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, were 38.7%, 40.2%, and 42.8% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We also conduct business from 17 customer contact management centers located in Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	International operations are subject to certain risks common to international activities, such as changes in foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, import/export license requirements, the imposition of trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador which expire at varying dates from 2014 through 2028.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As of December 31, 2013, we had cash balances of approximately $195.0 million held in international operations, most of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2014 Revenue Proposals in April 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013, with many provisions retroactively effective to January 1, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This Act, which extended the tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6) through the end of 2013, permits continued tax deferral on cash movements that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the U.S.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	While these cash movements are not taxable in the U.S., related foreign withholding taxes of $3.5 million were included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of certain foreign currency exchange exposures.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we can take actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Additionally, our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risks is not secured by any collateral.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Although each of the counterparty financial institutions with which we place hedging contracts are investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of the time of the placement, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability of any of our counterparties.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If a counterparty to one or more of our hedge transactions were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor and our exposure at the time would depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our offshore delivery locations include The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil, and while we have operated in global delivery markets since 1996, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct and expand such operations, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer contact management solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We provide services to our clients customers in 20 countries around the world.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Violations of these various laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries as well as recently enacted statutory and regulatory requirements related to derivative transactions, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, or impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges, thereby threatening or limiting our ability or the financial benefit to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations, or the risks associated therewith.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Risks Related to Our Employees Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S8	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our customer contact centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The actual integration of the company may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate the acquired operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the companies.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We have substantial goodwill and if it becomes impaired, then our profits would be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders equity would be reduced.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We recorded goodwill as a result of the ICT and Alpine acquisitions.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S6	This would result in a charge to our operating earnings.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S9	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P37_S10	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer contact management services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer contact management services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Because we are a publicly traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and expensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S7	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S8	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S9	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S10	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S11	Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 subjects us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements and disclosures, some of which have yet to be implemented by the SEC.
1010612_14_ITEM1A_P38_S12	Compliance with these requirements may be costly and adversely affect our business.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	This facility currently serves as the headquarters for senior management and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition to our headquarters and the customer contact management centers ( centers ) used by our Americas and EMEA segments discussed below, we also have offices in several countries around the world which support our Americas and EMEA segments.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2013, excluding centers we have exited, we operated 75 centers that are classified as follows:
1010612_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	Fulfillment Centers We own or lease space for these centers and serve multiple clients in each facility.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our centers were located in the following countries:
1010612_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	The leases for our centers have remaining terms ranging from one to twenty years and generally contain renewal options.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P3_S2	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new centers are available.
1010612_14_ITEM2_P3_S3	During 2013, our centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 73% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	that we have adequate legal defenses and/or when possible and appropriate, have provided adequate accruals related to those matters such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	the periods indicated, certain information as to the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of the funds legally available when and if declared by the Board of Directors.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 12, 2014, there were 871 holders of record of the common stock.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	We estimate there were approximately 9,900 beneficial owners of our common stock.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Below is a summary of stock repurchases for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except average price per share).
1010612_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) All shares purchased as part of the repurchase plan publicly announced on August 18, 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	Total number of shares approved for repurchase under the 2011 Share Repurchase Plan was 5.0 million with no expiration date.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	All of the shares available under the repurchase plan publicly announced on August 5, 2002 have been repurchased.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	Five-Year Stock Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative shareholder return on the common stock with the cumulative total return on the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Services Index, the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the S P Small Cap 600 and the SYKES Peer Group (as defined below).
1010612_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	The SYKES Peer Group is comprised of publicly traded companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from call center, customer care business, have similar business models to SYKES, and are those most commonly compared to SYKES by industry analysts following SYKES.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	SYKES has updated its Peer Group to include Telepeformance, a publicly-traded France-based global customer care company, which increasingly competes with SYKES in the marketplace.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P5_S3	SYKES further added Teleperformance in order for investors to have a broader set of data points from which to better gauge the Peer s share price performance and to substitute for publicly-traded competitors that have either gone private or have been acquired through strategic acquisitions over the past few years.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2008 in SYKES common stock, the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Services Index, the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the S P Small Cap 600 and SYKES Peer Group, including reinvestment of dividends.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	TTEC There can be no assurance that SYKES stock performance will continue into the future with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph above.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	SYKES does not make or endorse any predictions as to the future stock performance.
1010612_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	The information contained in the Stock Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or filed or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1010612_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	selected financial data has been derived from our consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	We sold our operations in Spain during 2012 and Argentina in 2010.
1010612_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	Accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect these results as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205-20 Discontinued Operations .
1010612_14_ITEM6_P0_S3	The information below should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto.

1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	On August 20, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), a Delaware corporation and an industry leader in the at-home agent space recruiting, training, managing and delivering award-winning customer contact management services through a secured and proprietary virtual call center environment with its operations located in the United States and Canada.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We refer to such acquisition herein as the Alpine acquisition.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company acquired Alpine to: create significant competitive differentiation for quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility driven by proprietary, internally-developed software, systems, processes and other intellectual property which uniquely overcome the challenges of the at-home delivery model; strengthen the Company s current service portfolio and go-to-market offering while expanding the breadth of clients with minimal client overlap; broaden the addressable market opportunity within existing and new verticals as well as clients; expand the addressable pool of skilled labor; leverage operational best practices across the Company s global platform, with the potential to convert more of its fixed cost to variable cost; and further enhance the growth and margin profile of the Company to drive shareholder value.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	This resulted in the Company paying a substantial premium for Alpine resulting in the recognition of goodwill.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	The total purchase price of $149.0 million was funded by $41.0 million in cash on hand and borrowings of $108.0 million under our credit agreement with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank ), dated May 3, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	See Liquidity Capital Resources later in this Item 7 and Note 20, Borrowings, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	The results of operations of Alpine have been reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since August 20, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	Discontinued Operations In March 2012, we sold our operations in Spain (the Spanish operations ), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated March 29, 2012 and a stock purchase agreement dated March 30, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P6_S8	We have reflected the operating results related to the operations in Spain as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	This business was historically reported as part of the EMEA segment.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	See Results of Operations Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Unless otherwise noted, discussions below pertain only to our continuing operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as the changes between the respective years:
1010612_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of revenues:
1010612_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	2013 Compared to 2012 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $135.8 million, or 12.0%, in 2013 from 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to new contract sales of $80.3 million and Alpine acquisition revenues of $68.6 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $25.4 million, lower volumes from existing contracts of $5.9 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $13.9 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 43.0% of Americas revenues, compared to 47.1% in 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	We weight these factors in our continual focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The increase in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to new contract sales of $28.0 million, higher volumes from existing contracts of $6.3 million and the positive foreign currency impact of $4.5 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $6.7 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	On a consolidated basis, we had 42,200 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2013, an increase of 2,900 seats from 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis was 73% compared to 75% in 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	This decrease was due partly to a delay in the timing of capacity rationalization, coupled with the increase in seats driven by facility upgrades and transfers, and growth in new and existing client programs that are in the process of ramping up.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	On a geographic segment basis, 36,100 seats were located in the Americas, an increase of 2,100 seats from 2012, and 6,100 seats were located in EMEA, an increase of 800 seats from 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	The consolidated offshore seat count as of December 31, 2013 was 23,400, or 55%, of our total seats, an increase of 1,400 seats, or 6%, from 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas as of December 31, 2013 was 70%, compared to 74% as of December 31, 2012, down primarily due to a delay in the timing of capacity rationalization, coupled with the increase in seats as previously mentioned.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA as of December 31, 2013 was 87%, compared to 82% as of December 31, 2012, up primarily due to an increase in demand from new and existing clients.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	We strive to attain an 85% capacity utilization metric at each of our locations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company plans to add approximately 1,200 seats on a gross basis in 2014.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	Approximately 50% of the new seat count is expected to be added in the first half of 2014, with the remainder in the second half.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Total seat count on a net basis for the full year, however, is expected to decrease by approximately 1,200 seats as we continue to rationalize excess capacity.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The increase of $117.3 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $6.4 million in the Americas and a negative foreign currency impact of $3.3 million in EMEA.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The increase in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.9% driven by the ramp up for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, partially offset by lower demand within the financial services and healthcare verticals without a commensurate reduction in labor costs, higher auto tow claim costs of 0.1% due to an increase in the average length of tows without a commensurate increase in fees at our Canadian roadside assistance operations and higher other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 4.4% driven by the ramp up for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, partially offset by lower fulfillment materials costs of 0.7%, lower billable supply costs of 0.5%, lower severance-related costs of 0.4% due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, lower recruiting costs of 0.2%, lower communications costs of 0.2%, lower travel costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase of $7.1 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $1.5 million in the Americas and a negative foreign currency impact of $0.8 million in EMEA.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The decrease in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 0.6%, lower facility-related costs of 0.4% due to rationalization of facilities, lower equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 0.9%, lower facility-related costs of 0.3%, lower communications costs of 0.3%, lower severance-related costs of 0.2% principally all due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	The decrease of $4.8 million in Corporate s general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower merger and integration costs of $3.5 million, lower consulting costs of $1.7 million, lower legal and professional fees of $1.0 million, lower travel costs of $0.3 million, lower equipment and maintenance costs of $0.3 million, lower communications costs of $0.2 million, lower training costs of $0.2 million and lower other costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by higher compensation costs of $2.1 million and higher facility-related costs of $0.6 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to capital expenditures for new seat additions, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The decrease in interest income reflects lower average invested balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents in 2013 compared to 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in interest (expense) reflects higher average outstanding borrowings primarily related to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to withholding taxes on offshore cash movements, U.S. taxation of offshore gains on derivatives and foreign exchange, tax benefits recognized in 2012 as a result of the Alpine acquisition and the fluctuations in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2013, we executed offshore cash movements to take advantage of The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act ) enacted on January 2, 2013, with retroactive application to January 1, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	This Act, which extended the tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6) through the end of 2013, permits continued tax deferral on such movements that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the U.S.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	While these cash movements are not taxable in the U.S., related foreign withholding taxes of $3.5 million were included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.6 million and $0.8 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	In 2012, (loss) from discontinued operations and the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of our operations in Spain in March 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	There was no tax impact on either the (loss) from discontinued operations or the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Consolidated revenues decreased $41.6 million, or 3.6%, in 2012 from 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The decrease in Americas revenues was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $85.9 million and lower volumes from existing contracts of $35.7 million, partially offset by new contract sales of $64.5 million, Alpine acquisition revenues of $40.6 million and the positive foreign currency impact of $0.5 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 47.1% of Americas revenues, compared to 47.8% in 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	While operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable to those in the United States, our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce, the trend of higher occupancy costs and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	We weight these factors in our continual focus to re-price or replace certain sub-profitable target client programs.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The decrease in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $32.7 million, lower volumes from existing contracts of $0.5 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $11.7 million, partially offset by new contract sales of $19.3 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Direct Salaries and Related Costs The decrease of $26.0 million in direct salaries and related costs included a negative foreign currency impact of $1.1 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $8.2 million in EMEA.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The increase in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.8%, higher travel costs of 0.1% and higher other costs of 0.2%, partially offset by lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower severance-related and compensation costs of 2.6% due to a workforce reduction in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, lower billable supply costs of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.4%, partially offset by higher fulfillment materials costs of 0.5%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	The increase of $3.3 million in general and administrative expenses included a negative foreign currency impact of $0.3 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $2.7 million in EMEA.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increase in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.4% principally related to higher wage rates, higher facility-related costs of 0.2% principally from the expansion of U.S. facilities and lease termination costs in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, higher software maintenance of 0.2%, higher legal and professional fees of 0.1%, higher taxes of 0.1% and higher other costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower severance-related costs of 0.8% and lower facility-related costs of 0.5% due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, lower equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2%, lower legal and professional fees of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%, partially offset by higher communications costs of 0.2% and higher compensation costs of 0.1%.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	The increase of $4.8 million in Corporate s general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher merger and integration costs of $2.9 million, higher compensation costs of $1.5 million, higher legal and professional fees of $1.1 million, higher software maintenance costs of $0.3 million and higher other costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower charitable contributions of $1.2 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The decrease in depreciation was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated assets and the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment in 2011 primarily related to the sale of land and a building located in Minot, North Dakota.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest income remained relatively unchanged in 2012 from 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in interest (expense) reflects higher average outstanding borrowings primarily related to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income Taxes The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from integration and transaction costs related to the Alpine acquisition, which lowered income in a high tax jurisdiction.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Prior to the passage of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, we determined that we intended to distribute all of the current year and future years earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary to its foreign parent.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Withholding taxes of $0.8 million and $0.9 million related to this distribution are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Gain (Loss) from Discontinued Operations In 2012, the (loss) from discontinued operations and the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of our operations in Spain in March 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	In 2011, the net gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of our operations in Argentina resulted from the reversal of the accrued liability related to the expiration of the indemnification to the purchaser for the possible loss of a specific client business.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	There was no tax impact on either the (loss) from discontinued operations or the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations.

1010612_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions or share repurchase activities.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 18, 2011, the Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).

1010612_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	Our Board previously authorized us on August 5, 2002 to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock, the last of which were repurchased during 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	The shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs were as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	During 2013, cash increased $86.2 million from operating activities, $32.0 million due to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $0.4 million from the proceeds from sale of property and equipment, $0.2 million from the proceeds from grants and $0.1 million of other.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Further, we used $59.2 million for capital expenditures, $25.0 million to repay long-term debt, $5.5 million to repurchase our stock, $0.6 million for investment in restricted cash and $0.2 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, resulting in a $24.7 million increase in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $3.7 million).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2013 were $86.2 million, compared to $86.5 million in 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	The $0.3 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a net decrease of $14.2 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities, partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in net income and a $5.1 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on the sale of discontinued operations, net (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	The $14.2 million decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $15.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $9.3 million decrease in other liabilities and a $0.7 million decrease in taxes payable, partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in other assets and a $3.0 million increase in deferred revenue.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to additional billings related to higher volumes within certain clients in 2013 over 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P38_S6	The decrease in other liabilities is primarily related to a decrease in deposits received from clients for future services.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We sold our operations in Spain (the Spanish operations ) in 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Cash flows from discontinued operations, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were as follows (in thousands): Cash (used for) operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash used by the Spanish operations in 2012 and 2011 (none in 2013).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations for 2012 primarily represents the cash divested upon the sale of the Spanish operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations represents capital expenditures in 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	The sale of the Spanish operations resulted in a loss of $10.7 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	We do not expect the absence of the cash flows from our discontinued operations in Spain and to materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $59.2 million for 2013, compared to $38.6 million for 2012, an increase of $20.6 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	In 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $45.0 million to $50.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, facility upgrades, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	On May 3, 2012, we entered into a $245 million revolving credit facility (the 2012 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent ( KeyBank ).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The 2012 Credit Agreement replaced our previous $75 million revolving credit facility dated February 2, 2010, as amended, which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The 2012 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2012 Credit Agreement and had $98.0 million and $91.0 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, with an average daily utilization of $102.5 million during 2013 and $96.8 million for the outstanding period during 2012 (none in 2011).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the related interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred loan fees, under our credit agreements was $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively (none in 2011).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	The 2012 Credit Agreement includes a $184 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2012 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	The 2012 Credit Agreement will mature on May 2, 2017.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement will bear interest at the rates set forth in the Credit Agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S8	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.175%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S9	The 2012 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S10	We are currently under audit in several tax jurisdictions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S11	In April 2012, we received an assessment for the Canadian 2003-2006 audit for which we filed a Notice of Objection in July 2012 and paid a mandatory security deposit.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S12	Requests for Competent Authority Assistance were filed with both the Canadian Revenue Agency and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for this audit cycle.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S13	In July and October 2013, we received reassessments for the 2007-2009 audit, which resulted in additional payments.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P42_S14	These payments bring the total amount of deposits for both audit cycles to $17.3 million and $15.0 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	In December 2013, we filed a Notice of Objection to the 2007-2009 reassessment.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain, we believe we are adequately reserved for these audits and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	On August 20, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Alpine, a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 27, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The purchase price of $149.0 million was funded through cash on hand of $41.0 million and borrowings of $108.0 million under our 2012 Credit Agreement, dated May 3, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had $212.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 92.0% or $195.0 million, was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	These funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	We do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	We expect our current domestic cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our domestic anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	However, from time to time, we may borrow funds under our 2012 Credit Agreement as a result of the timing of our working capital needs, including capital expenditures.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Additionally, we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	If we should require more cash in the U.S. than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and/or raise capital in the U.S through additional borrowings or debt/equity issuances.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, interest expense and/or dilution of earnings.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	At December 31, 2013, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P49_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2013, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our purchase obligations, which include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits, which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilities, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	(6) Amount represents total outstanding borrowings.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	See Note 20, Borrowings, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	(7) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The amount in the table has been reduced by Canadian mandatory security deposits of $17.3 million, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $7.3 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals (primarily lease obligations) and pension obligations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	See Notes 4, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, and 25, Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.4% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ) (as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ) ( ASU 2009-13 ), we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Once we allocate revenue to each deliverable, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, we have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $5.0 million as of December 31, 2013, or 1.9% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $42.7 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $3.0 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $39.7 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $18.2 million as of December 31, 2013 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2013, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $376.8 million as of December 31, 2013, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	If these earnings are repatriated or otherwise become taxable in the U.S, we would be subject to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The U.S. Department of the Treasury released the General Explanations of the Administration s Fiscal Year 2014 Revenue Proposals in April 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	These proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy, which may materially impact U.S. taxation of international earnings.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	We continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	In addition, The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013, with many provisions retroactively effective to January 1, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	This Act, which extended the tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 954(c)(6) through the end of 2013, permits continued tax deferral on such movements that would otherwise be taxable immediately in the U.S.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	While these cash movements are not taxable in the U.S., related foreign withholding taxes of $3.5 million were included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	As of December 31, 2013, we had $15.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $1.9 million from $16.9 million as of December 31, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S6	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $15.0 million and $16.9 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S7	We do not anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S8	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S9	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S10	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2014 through 2028.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P75_S11	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, which had a carrying value of $193.6 million as of December 31, 2013, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of impairment losses related to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill, which had a carrying value of $199.8 million as of December 31, 2013, for impairment at least annually, during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	To assess the realizability of goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	We may elect to forgo this option and proceed to the annual two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment and it indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value, or we elect to forgo this qualitative assessment, we will proceed to Step 1 testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability-weighted cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	If Step 1 indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, we will proceed to Step 2 where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as it would in a business combination.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in Step 2.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	In estimating future cash flows, we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization, projected changes in the prices we charge for our services, projected labor costs, as well as contract negotiation status.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	We use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the services are being provided.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	As of July 31, 2013, our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their estimated carrying values, and therefore goodwill in these reporting units was not impaired.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	If actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower, causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Contingencies We record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Each quarter, management reviews all litigation and claims on a case-by-case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Other We have made certain other estimates that, while not involving the same degree of judgment, are important to understanding our financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	These estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self-insurance accruals.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2013-05 Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity ( ASU 2013-05 ).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 indicate that a cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) is attached to the parent s investment in a foreign entity and should be released in a manner consistent with the derecognition guidance on investments in entities.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Thus, the entire amount of the CTA associated with the foreign entity would be released when there has been a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, a loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity (i.e., the foreign entity is deconsolidated), or a step acquisition for a foreign entity (i.e., when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	ASU 2013-05 does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the CTA of the foreign entity into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P89_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-05 on January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU 2013-11 ).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 indicate that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	In situations where a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-11 on January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Acts ).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future, thus adversely affecting our profitability.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The Internal Revenue Service recently announced that the employer mandate provisions of the Acts will be delayed until 2015 and the promised additional guidance has yet to be issued.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	As a result of the delay, the Company s cost to provide benefits to employees in 2014 are expected to be comparable to our costs in 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	Once the guidance is finalized, we will evaluate the potential impact of the Acts on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for 2015.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P95_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Movements in non-U.S. Dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in certain earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Option and forward derivative contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables, and other transactions initiated in the United States, that are denominated in a foreign currency.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	Additionally, we employ FX contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in The Philippines, Canada and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ), Canadian Dollars, and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ), with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints ( HUF ) and Romanian Leis ( RON ).
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP, CRC, HUF and RON we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2013 with counterparties through December 2014 with notional amounts totaling $165.1 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S6	As of December 31, 2013, we had net total derivative liabilities associated with these contracts with a fair value of $2.1 million, which will settle within the next 12 months.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S7	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC and the EUR was to weaken against the HUF and RON by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $13.8 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P98_S8	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	We entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $32.7 million to hedge net investments in our foreign operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against the risk that the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and economic exposures related to our foreign currency-based investments in these subsidiaries.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of $1.7 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2013, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $3.4 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P99_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $59.2 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of these derivatives was a net receivable of $1.0 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2013, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $5.3 million.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P100_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P101_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had $98.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	Based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2013, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $1.0 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S6	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This report appears on page 46.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_14_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P56_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P56_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P56_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P57_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P63_S3	Utilizing SYKES integrated onshore/offshore global delivery model, SYKES provides its services through multiple communication channels encompassing phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging and chat.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P63_S4	SYKES complements its outsourced customer contact management services with various enterprise support services in the United States that encompass services for a company s internal support operations, from technical staffing services to outsourced corporate help desk services.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	In August 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 27, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company has reflected the operating results in the Consolidated Statement of Operations since August 20, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	See Note 2, Acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc., for additional information on the acquisition of this business.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S3	In March 2012, the Company sold its operations in Spain (the Spanish operations ), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated March 29, 2012 and a stock purchase agreement dated March 30, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S4	The Company reflected the operating results related to the Spanish operations as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S5	Cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P64_S6	See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for additional information on the sale of the Spanish operations.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SYKES and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP ) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Subsequent Events Subsequent events or transactions have been evaluated through the date and time of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Recognition of Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605 Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company primarily recognizes revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P68_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.4% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	[as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13 )], the Company determines if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S4	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P69_S5	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Estimated selling price is based on the Company s best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Once the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable, the Company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company s fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, the Company had no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	Cash in the amount of $212.0 million and $187.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was primarily held in interest bearing investments, which have original maturities of less than 90 days.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	Cash and cash equivalents of $195.0 million and $182.9 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States ( U.S. ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes cash whereby the Company s ability to use the funds at any time is contractually limited or is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade account receivables for estimated losses arising from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company s estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of the Company s trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of the Company s clients.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P75_S2	It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	Cost and related accumulated depreciation on assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred, if any, to internally develop software upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment .
1010612_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows (the reporting unit ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets or independent third party offers.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P79_S3	Occasionally, the Company redeploys property and equipment from under-utilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the under-utilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P79_S4	Except as discussed in Note 5, Fair Value, the Company determined that its property and equipment were not impaired as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company has entered into operating lease agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases, rent free periods, or periods in which rent payments are reduced.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The total amount of the rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC 840 Leases.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired goodwill over an indefinite period of time.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	For goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the third quarter, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P82_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P82_S4	The Company elected to forgo the option to first assess qualitative factors and completed its annual two-step goodwill impairment test during the three months ended September 30, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Under ASC 350, the carrying value of assets is calculated at the reporting unit level.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	The quantitative assessment of goodwill includes comparing a reporting unit s calculated fair value to its carrying value.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	The calculation of fair value requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P83_S5	As of July 31, 2013, the Company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value and goodwill was not impaired.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or changes in circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Fair value for intangible assets is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Philippine operations are subject to value added tax ( VAT ) which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased throughout The Philippines.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	Upon validation and certification of the VAT receivables by the Philippine government, the resulting value added tax certificates ( certificates ) can be either used to offset current tax obligations or offered for sale to the Philippine government.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	The Philippine government previously allowed companies to sell the certificates to third parties, but this option was eliminated during the three months ended September 30, 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P86_S3	The VAT receivables balance is recorded at its net realizable value.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ) which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with the criteria of ASC 740.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P87_S2	Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets due to an uncertainty of realization.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P87_S3	Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence, in accordance with criteria of ASC 740, to support a change in judgment about the ability to realize the related deferred tax assets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	Uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in its tax returns, and records a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company self-insures for certain levels of workers compensation and, as of January 1, 2011, began self-funding the medical, prescription drug and dental benefit plans in the United States.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	Estimated costs are accrued at the projected settlements for known and anticipated claims.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P91_S3	Amounts related to these self-insurance programs are included in Accrued employee compensation and benefits and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment (together, property grants ) is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P92_S2	Amounts received in excess of the cost of the building are allocated to the cost of equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company receives government employment grants as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a specified time period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P93_S1	The grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P93_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized primarily as a reduction to Direct salaries and related costs using the proportionate performance model over the required employment period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from 30 days to seven years.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P94_S2	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over the next ensuing twelve month period and the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P94_S3	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the 2004 Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), both approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S3	The Company issues common stock and uses treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S4	In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company recognizes in its accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P95_S5	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trust and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options Foreign currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value as it re-prices at varying interest rates.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	ASC 825 Financial Instruments ( ASC 825 ) permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P101_S2	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P102_S2	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P102_S3	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	Determination of Fair Value The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P106_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P106_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P107_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	Money Market and Open-End Mutual Funds The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of money market and open-end mutual funds, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over the counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	The investment assets of the rabbi trust are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 13, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, and Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Guaranteed Investment Certificates Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P113_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Foreign Currency and Derivative Instruments The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company generally utilizes non-deliverable forward contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P114_S3	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, or if the Company de-designates a derivative as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S4	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S5	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S6	All changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Other income (expense) .
1010612_14_ITEM15_P122_S7	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, for further information on financial derivative instruments.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Certain balances in prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2013-05 Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity ( ASU 2013-05 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 indicate that a cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) is attached to the parent s investment in a foreign entity and should be released in a manner consistent with the derecognition guidance on investments in entities.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	Thus, the entire amount of the CTA associated with the foreign entity would be released when there has been a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, a loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity (i.e., the foreign entity is deconsolidated), or a step acquisition for a foreign entity (i.e., when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S3	ASU 2013-05 does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the CTA of the foreign entity into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S4	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P124_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-05 on January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU 2013-11 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 indicate that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	In situations where a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-11 on January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2011-11 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either 1) offset (netting assets and liabilities) in accordance with Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P129_S3	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-11 as of January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, for further information.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment ( ASU 2012-02 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S4	Under the amendments in ASU 2012-02, an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S5	An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P131_S6	The amendments in ASU 2012-02 are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-02 on January 1, 2013 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	See Goodwill in this Note 1 for further information.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2013-01 ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-01 clarify which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	ASU 2013-01 addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under ASU 2011-11 was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to the financial statement users.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	In choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures, the FASB determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1010612_14_ITEM15_P134_S2	The amendments in ASU 2013-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P134_S3	Retrospective application is required for any period presented that begins before the entity s initial application of the new requirements.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P272_S0	Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P272_S1	The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P273_S0	Exercises and forfeitures are estimated within the valuation model using employee termination and other historical data.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P279_S2	The Company recognizes compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the fair value (which approximates the current market price) of the restricted shares (and RSUs) on the date of grant ratably over the requisite service period based on the probability of achieving the performance goals.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P279_S3	Changes in the probability of achieving the performance goals from period to period will result in corresponding changes in compensation expense.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P280_S0	The employment-based restricted shares currently outstanding vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the participant is employed by the Company on such date.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P280_S1	In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2011 Plan and 2001 Plan) prior to the date the restricted shares vest, all of the restricted shares will vest and the restrictions on transfer will lapse with respect to such vested shares on the date of the change in control, provided that participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P280_S2	If the participant s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, either by the Company or participant, prior to the date on which the restricted shares have vested and the restrictions have lapsed with respect to such vested shares, any restricted shares remaining subject to the restrictions (together with any dividends paid thereon) will be forfeited, unless there has been a change in control prior to such date.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P289_S3	The reportable segments consist of (1) the Americas, which includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim, and provides outsourced customer contact management solutions (with an emphasis on technical support and customer service) and technical staffing and (2) EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and provides outsourced customer contact management solutions (with an emphasis on technical support and customer service) and fulfillment services.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P289_S4	The sites within Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim are included in the Americas segment given the nature of the business and client profile, which is primarily made up of U.S.-based companies that are using the Company s services in these locations to support their customer contact management needs.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P290_S0	Information about the Company s reportable segments is as follows (in thousands):
1010612_14_ITEM15_P291_S0	(1) Other items (including corporate costs, impairment costs, other income and expense, and income taxes) are shown for purposes of reconciling to the Company s consolidated totals as shown in the tables above for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P291_S1	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P291_S2	Inter-segment revenues are not material to the Americas and EMEA segment results.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P291_S3	The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on revenue and income (loss) from operations, and does not include segment assets or other income and expense items for management reporting purposes.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P292_S0	(2) Revenues, depreciation and amortization include results from continuing operations only.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P293_S0	(3) Includes the (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, as well as the gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes, if any.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P295_S0	The Company has multiple distinct contracts with AT T spread across multiple lines of businesses, including a master services agreement that expires in 2017 and various statements of work, which expire at varying dates between 2014 and 2015.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P295_S1	The Company has historically renewed most of these contracts.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P295_S2	However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S0	Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S1	Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact the Company s relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S2	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of the Company s key clients, including AT T, could have a material adverse effect on its performance.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S3	Many of the Company s contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S4	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of the Company s services under its contracts without penalty.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P296_S5	Total revenues from the Company s next largest client, which was in the financial services vertical market in each of the years, were as follows (in thousands):

1010612_14_ITEM15_P303_S2	The lease payments on the 20 year lease were negotiated at or below market rates, and the lease is cancellable at the option of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P303_S3	There are significant penalties for early cancellation which decrease over time.

1010612_14_ITEM15_P318_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P319_S0	EXHIBIT 32.2 CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. SECTION 1350 In connection with the Annual Report of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, W. Michael Kipphut, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1010612_14_ITEM15_P320_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	At December 31, 2014, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2014, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our purchase obligations, which include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits, which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilties, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	(6) Amount represents total outstanding borrowings.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	See Note 20, Borrowings, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	(7) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, of which $4.7 million is included in Long-term income tax liabilities and $2.7 million is netted within Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The amount in the table has been reduced by Canadian mandatory security deposits of $15.9 million, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $7.4 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals (primarily lease obligations) and pension obligations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	See Notes 4, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, and 25, Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.4%, 1.3% and 1.5% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ) (as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ) ( ASU 2009-13 ), we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Once we allocate revenue to each deliverable, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, we have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $4.7 million as of December 31, 2014, or 1.6% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $34.1 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $0.5 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $33.6 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $10.5 million as of December 31, 2014 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2014, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $380.8 million as of December 31, 2014, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If these earnings are repatriated or otherwise become taxable in the U.S, we would be subject to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had $13.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $1.7 million from $15.0 million as of December 31, 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $13.3 million and $15.0 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	We anticipate that approximately $2.2 million of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2015 through 2028.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $2.7 million, $4.7 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, which had a carrying value of $170.5 million as of December 31, 2014, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of impairment losses related to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill, which had a carrying value of $193.8 million as of December 31, 2014, for impairment at least annually, during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	To assess the realizability of goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may elect to forgo this option and proceed to the annual two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment and it indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value, or we elect to forgo this qualitative assessment, we will proceed to Step 1 testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability-weighted cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If Step 1 indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, we will proceed to Step 2 where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as it would in a business combination.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in Step 2.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In estimating future cash flows, we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization, projected changes in the prices we charge for our services, projected labor costs, as well as contract negotiation status.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the services are being provided.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As of July 31, 2014, our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their estimated carrying values, and therefore goodwill in these reporting units was not impaired.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower, causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Contingencies We record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Each quarter, management reviews all litigation and claims on a case-by-case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Other We have made certain other estimates that, while not involving the same degree of judgment, are important to understanding our financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self-insurance accruals.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08 ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-08 indicate that only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Currently, a component of an entity that is a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary, or an asset group is eligible for discontinued operations presentation.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The amendments should be applied to all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The adoption of ASU 2014-08 on January 1, 2015 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and indicate that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	To achieve this, an entity should identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12 ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The amendments are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-12 to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	This amendment eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items as part of the FASB s initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In March 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Acts ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The Acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future, thus adversely affecting our profitability.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	However, based on our evaluation of the potential impact of the Acts, the cost to provide health benefits to employees in compliance with the Acts is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than USD are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Movements in non-USD currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in certain earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We also utilize derivative contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables that are denominated in a foreign currency and to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in The Philippines and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ) and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ), with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints ( HUF ) and Romanian Leis ( RON ).
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP, CRC, HUF and RON we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2014 with counterparties through December 2015 with notional amounts totaling $144.0 million.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of $0.6 million, which will settle within the next 12 months.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC and the EUR was to weaken against the HUF and RON by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $12.7 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $51.6 million to hedge net investments in our foreign operations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against the risk that the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and economic exposures related to our foreign currency-based investments in these subsidiaries.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $4.1 million.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2014, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $4.7 million.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $64.5 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of $0.3 million.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2014, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $5.1 million.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had $75.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2014, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $0.9 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are located beginning on page 53 and page 33 of this report, respectively.
1010612_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	This facility currently serves as the headquarters for senior management and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition to our headquarters and the customer contact management centers ( centers ) used by our Americas and EMEA segments discussed below, we also have offices in several countries around the world which support our Americas and EMEA segments.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2014, excluding centers we have exited, we operated 70 centers that are classified as follows:
1010612_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	Fulfillment Centers We own or lease space for these centers and serve multiple clients in each facility.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our centers were located in the following countries:
1010612_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	The leases for our centers have remaining terms ranging from one to twenty years and generally contain renewal options.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P3_S2	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new centers are available.
1010612_15_ITEM2_P3_S3	At December 31, 2014, our centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 79% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	that we have adequate legal defenses and/or when possible and appropriate, have provided adequate accruals related to those matters such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.

( Alpine ), a Delaware corporation and an industry leader in the virtual at-home agent space recruiting, training, managing and delivering award-winning customer contact management services through a secured and proprietary virtual call center environment with its operations located in the United States and Canada.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We refer to such acquisition herein as the Alpine acquisition.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We acquired Alpine to: create significant competitive differentiation for quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility driven by proprietary, internally-developed software, systems, processes and other intellectual property which uniquely overcome the challenges of the virtual at-home agent delivery model; strengthen our current service portfolio and go-to-market offering while expanding the breadth of clients with minimal client overlap; broaden the addressable market opportunity within existing and new verticals as well as clients; expand the addressable pool of skilled labor; leverage operational best practices across our global platform, with the potential to convert more of its fixed cost to variable cost; and further enhance the growth and margin profile to drive shareholder value.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	This resulted in our paying a substantial premium for Alpine resulting in the recognition of goodwill.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	The total purchase price of $149.0 million was funded by $41.0 million in cash on hand and borrowings of $108.0 million under our credit agreement with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank ), dated May 3, 2012.

1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	2014 Compared to 2013 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $64.1 million, or 5.1%, in 2014 from 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to new contract sales of $91.6 million and higher volumes from existing contracts of $2.6 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $50.4 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $23.8 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 38.9% of Americas revenues, compared to 39.5% in 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	The increase in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to higher volumes from existing contracts of $30.6 million and new contract sales of $21.2 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $4.6 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $3.1 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	On a consolidated basis, we had 41,000 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2014, a decrease of 1,200 seats from 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S5	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis was 79% compared to 73% in 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S6	This increase was due to seat rationalization in the Americas and growth within new and existing clients.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S7	On a geographic segment basis, 34,500 seats were located in the Americas, a decrease of 1,600 seats from 2013, and 6,500 seats were located in EMEA, an increase of 400 seats from 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S8	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas as of December 31, 2014 was 77%, compared to 70% as of December 31, 2013, up primarily due to seat rationalization and growth within new and existing clients.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S9	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA as of December 31, 2014 was 90%, compared to 87% as of December 31, 2013, up primarily due to growth within new and existing clients.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S10	We strive to attain an 85% capacity utilization metric at each of our locations.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S11	We plan to add approximately 1,700 seats on a gross basis in 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S12	More than three-quarters of the new seat count is expected to be added in the first half of 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S13	Total seat count on a net basis for the full year, however, is expected to remain unchanged relative to 2014 as we plan to rationalize approximately 1,700 seats.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S14	Direct Salaries and Related Costs The increase of $36.8 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $23.1 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $2.1 million in EMEA.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S15	The decrease in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower auto tow claim costs of 0.3%, lower compensation costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P10_S16	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.6% driven by the increase in new client program ramp up costs in the prior period in the communications vertical as well as new client program growth within the technology vertical, and lower billable supply costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher communications costs of 0.3%, higher fulfillment materials costs of 0.3% and higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The increase of $0.5 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $5.5 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $0.4 million in EMEA.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decrease in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower facility-related costs of 0.6%, lower merger and integration costs of 0.1% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower facility-related costs of 0.9%, lower compensation costs of 0.5%, lower travel costs of 0.3%, lower communications costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase of $3.7 million in Corporate s general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of $1.9 million, higher charitable contributions of $1.4 million, higher legal and professional fees of $0.7 million, higher consulting costs of $0.5 million, higher facility-related costs of $0.2 million and higher insurance costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower merger and integration costs of $0.6 million, lower software maintenance costs of $0.4 million and lower other costs of $0.2 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to net fixed asset additions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The decrease in amortization was primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment in 2014 primarily related to the sale of land, a building and fixed assets located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	See Note 14, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Other Income (Expense) The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the amount of average invested funds in 2014 compared to 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease in interest (expense) was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of average outstanding borrowings in 2014 compared to 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income Taxes The increase in income taxes in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to a $23.0 million increase in income in a high tax rate jurisdiction which increased the tax provision by $6.3 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in foreign withholding taxes recognized in 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The remaining change is due to several factors, including fluctuations in earnings among the various other jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	2013 Compared to 2012 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $135.8 million, or 12.0%, in 2013 from 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to new contract sales of $80.3 million and Alpine acquisition revenues of $68.6 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $25.4 million, lower volumes from existing contracts of $5.9 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $13.9 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 39.5% of Americas revenues, compared to 44.5% in 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	The increase in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to new contract sales of $28.0 million, higher volumes from existing contracts of $6.3 million and the positive foreign currency impact of $4.5 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $6.7 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	Direct Salaries and Related Costs The increase of $117.3 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $6.4 million in the Americas and a negative foreign currency impact of $3.3 million in EMEA.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S5	The increase in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 1.9% driven by the ramp up for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, partially offset by lower demand within the financial services and healthcare verticals without a commensurate reduction in labor costs, higher auto tow claim costs of 0.1% due to an increase in the average length of tows without a commensurate increase in fees at our Canadian roadside assistance operations and higher other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P16_S6	The increase in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 4.4% driven by the ramp up for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, partially offset by lower fulfillment materials costs of 0.7%, lower billable supply costs of 0.5%, lower severance-related costs of 0.4% due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan, lower recruiting costs of 0.2%, lower communications costs of 0.2%, lower travel costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The increase of $7.1 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $1.5 million in the Americas and a negative foreign currency impact of $0.8 million in EMEA.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 0.6%, lower facility-related costs of 0.4% due to rationalization of facilities, lower equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 0.9%, lower facility-related costs of 0.3%, lower communications costs of 0.3%, lower severance-related costs of 0.2% principally all due to the closure of certain sites in connection with the Fourth Quarter 2011 Exit Plan and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	The decrease of $4.8 million in Corporate s general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower merger and integration costs of $3.5 million, lower consulting costs of $1.7 million, lower legal and professional fees of $1.0 million, lower travel costs of $0.3 million, lower equipment and maintenance costs of $0.3 million, lower communications costs of $0.2 million, lower training costs of $0.2 million and lower other costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by higher compensation costs of $2.1 million and higher facility-related costs of $0.6 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to net fixed asset additions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	See Note 5, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of long-lived assets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The decrease in interest income reflects lower average invested balances of interest bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents in 2013 compared to 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in interest (expense) reflects higher average outstanding borrowings primarily related to the August 2012 Alpine acquisition.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Other (expense) excludes the cumulative translation effects and unrealized gains (losses) on financial derivatives that are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in income taxes in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to withholding taxes on offshore cash movements of $3.5 million to take advantage of The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 enacted on January 2, 2013, with retroactive application to January 1, 2012, U.S. taxation of offshore gains on derivatives and foreign exchange of $1.8 million and tax benefits recognized in 2012 related to merger and integration costs as a result of the Alpine acquisition of $1.1 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The remaining change is due to several factors, including fluctuations in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	In 2012, the (loss) from discontinued operations and the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of our operations in Spain in March 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	There was no tax impact on either the (loss) from discontinued operations or the (loss) on sale of discontinued operations.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results from continuing operations for 2014 and 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	(4) The quarter ended December 31, 2014 includes a $2.6 million (gain) on the sale of fixed assets, land and building located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	See Note 14, Property and Equipment, for further information.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	(5) Net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Business Outlook For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continue to experience healthy demand from clients within the communications and technology verticals.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition, based on early indications, we anticipate some firming of demand within the financial services vertical.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	As in prior years, with fewer work days in the second quarter, coupled with the timing of seat additions and ramps related to program wins, we expect consolidated second-half 2015 revenues to be greater than the first-half.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Furthermore, based on foreign exchange rates as of February 2015, our full-year business outlook reflects the anticipation of approximately $50.0 million in negative impact to revenues due to unfavorable foreign currency movements relative to 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	In addition, we have already eliminated certain sub-profitable programs, which are expected to incrementally impact 2015 revenues by approximately $25.0 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S5	Despite the foreign exchange impact to 2015 revenues, we expect expansion of operating margins.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S6	Operating margins as well as diluted earnings per share are expected to be higher in the second half of 2015 relative to the first-half due to timing of the resetting of payroll tax withholdings for the new year, coupled with the impact of inclement weather on our Canadian roadside assistance business.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S7	Our revenues and earnings per share assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2015 are based on foreign exchange rates as of February 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P28_S8	Therefore, the continued volatility in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of the markets we serve could have a further impact, positive or negative, on revenues and earnings per share relative to the business outlook for the first quarter and full-year as discussed above.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We anticipate a slightly higher effective tax rate for full-year 2015 versus 2014 with the effective tax rate differential driven chiefly by a shift in the geographic mix of earnings to higher tax rate jurisdictions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions, share repurchase activities or a potential sale of previously exited customer contact management centers.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	On August 18, 2011, the Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	A total of 4.0 million shares have been repurchased under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program since inception.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs were as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): During 2014, cash increased $94.3 million from operating activities, $3.6 million from the proceeds from sale of property and equipment, $0.2 million from the release of restricted cash and $0.3 million from the proceeds from grants.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Further, we used $44.7 million for capital expenditures, $23.0 million to repay long-term debt, $12.6 million to repurchase our stock and $0.4 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, resulting in a $3.2 million increase in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $14.5 million).
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2014 were $94.3 million, compared to $86.2 million in 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The $8.1 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a $20.5 million increase in net income and a $2.0 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on the sale of discontinued operations, net (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, partially offset by a net decrease of $14.4 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The $14.4 million decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of an $18.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $2.4 million decrease in other liabilities and a $0.7 million decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in other assets and a $1.8 million increase in taxes payable.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	The $18.2 million increase in the change in accounts receivable is primarily due to additional receivables billings related to higher volumes within certain clients as well as the timing of receivables billings and collections in 2014 over 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We sold our operations in Spain (the Spanish operations ) in 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Cash flows from discontinued operations, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, were as follows (in thousands): Cash (used for) operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash used by the Spanish operations in 2012 (none in 2014 and 2013).
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Cash (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations for 2012 primarily represents the cash divested upon the sale of the Spanish operations.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	The sale of the Spanish operations resulted in a loss of $10.7 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	We do not expect the absence of the cash flows from our discontinued operations in Spain to materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $44.7 million for 2014, compared to $59.2 million for 2013, a decrease of $14.5 million.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P33_S6	In 2015, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $55.0 million to $60.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, Enterprise Resource Planning upgrades, facility upgrades, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	On May 3, 2012, we entered into a $245 million revolving credit facility (the 2012 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent ( KeyBank ).
1010612_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The 2012 Credit Agreement replaced our previous $75 million revolving credit facility dated February 2, 2010, as amended, which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The 2012 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2012 Credit Agreement and had $75.0 million and $98.0 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with an average daily utilization of $85.9 million and $102.5 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $96.8 million for the outstanding period during 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	2014, 2013 and 2012, the related interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred loan fees, under our credit agreements was $1.1 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The 2012 Credit Agreement includes a $184 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2012 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	The 2012 Credit Agreement will mature on May 2, 2017.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S5	Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement will bear interest at the rates set forth in the Credit Agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S6	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.175%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2012 Credit Agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S7	The 2012 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S8	We are currently under audit in several tax jurisdictions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S9	We received assessments for the Canadian 2003-2009 audit.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S10	Requests for Competent Authority Assistance were filed with both the Canadian Revenue Agency and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and we paid mandatory security deposits to Canada as part of this process.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S11	The total amount of deposits, net of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, are $15.9 million and $17.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P36_S12	Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain, we believe we are adequately reserved for these audits and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 20, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Alpine, a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 27, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The purchase price of $149.0 million was funded through cash on hand of $41.0 million and borrowings of $108.0 million under our 2012 Credit Agreement, dated May 3, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had $215.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90.3% or $194.4 million, was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	These funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	We do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	We expect our current domestic cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our domestic anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	However, from time to time, we may borrow funds under our 2012 Credit Agreement as a result of the timing of our working capital needs, including capital expenditures.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Additionally, we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	If we should require more cash in the U.S. than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and/or raise capital in the U.S through additional borrowings or debt/equity issuances.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, interest expense and/or dilution of earnings.
1010612_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S6	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This report appears on page 45.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_15_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	In August 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 27, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	The Company has reflected the operating results in the Consolidated Statements of Operations since August 20, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	See Note 2, Acquisition of Alpine Access, Inc., for additional information on the acquisition of this business.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	In March 2012, the Company sold its operations in Spain (the Spanish operations ), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated March 29, 2012 and a stock purchase agreement dated March 30, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S4	The Company reflected the operating results related to the Spanish operations as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S5	Cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P69_S6	See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for additional information on the sale of the Spanish operations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SYKES and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP ) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	Subsequent Events Subsequent events or transactions have been evaluated through the date and time of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	Recognition of Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605 Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Company primarily recognizes revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P73_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.4%, 1.3% and 1.5% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	[as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13 )], the Company determines if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S3	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S4	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S5	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S6	The Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S7	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P74_S8	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Estimated selling price is based on the Company s best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Once the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable, the Company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Company s fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, the Company had no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	Cash in the amount of $215.1 million and $212.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was primarily held in interest bearing investments, which have original maturities of less than 90 days.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	Cash and cash equivalents of $194.4 million and $195.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States ( U.S. ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes cash whereby the Company s ability to use the funds at any time is contractually limited or is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade account receivables for estimated losses arising from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company s estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of the Company s trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of the Company s clients.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P80_S2	Cost and related accumulated depreciation on assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred, if any, to internally develop software upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows (the reporting unit ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets or independent third party offers.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	Occasionally, the Company redeploys property and equipment from under-utilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the under-utilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	Except as discussed in Note 5, Fair Value, the Company determined that its property and equipment were not impaired as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company has entered into operating lease agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases, rent free periods, or periods in which rent payments are reduced.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	The total amount of the rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC 840 Leases.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired goodwill over an indefinite period of time.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	For goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the third quarter, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P87_S2	However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P87_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P87_S4	The Company elected to forgo the option to first assess qualitative factors and completed its annual two-step goodwill impairment test during the three months ended September 30, 2014.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Under ASC 350, the carrying value of assets is calculated at the reporting unit level.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The quantitative assessment of goodwill includes comparing a reporting unit s calculated fair value to its carrying value.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The calculation of fair value requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P88_S5	As of July 31, 2014, the Company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value and goodwill was not impaired.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or changes in circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	Fair value for intangible assets is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Philippine operations are subject to value added tax ( VAT ) which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased throughout The Philippines.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	Upon validation and certification of the VAT receivables by the Philippine government, the resulting value added tax certificates ( certificates ) can be either used to offset current tax obligations or offered for sale to the Philippine government.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	The VAT receivables balance is recorded at its net realizable value.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ) which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with the criteria of ASC 740.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P92_S2	Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets due to an uncertainty of realization.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P92_S3	Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence, in accordance with criteria of ASC 740, to support a change in judgment about the ability to realize the related deferred tax assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	Uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in its tax returns, and records a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company self-insures for certain levels of workers compensation and self-funds the medical, prescription drug and dental benefit plans in the United States.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	Estimated costs are accrued at the projected settlements for known and anticipated claims.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P97_S2	Amounts related to these self-insurance programs are included in Accrued employee compensation and benefits and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment (together, property grants ) is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	Amounts received in excess of the cost of the building are allocated to the cost of equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company receives government employment grants as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a specified time period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	The grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized primarily as a reduction to Direct salaries and related costs using the proportionate performance model over the required employment period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from 30 days to seven years.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over the next ensuing twelve month period and the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P100_S3	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the 2004 Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), both approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S3	The Company issues common stock and uses treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S4	In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company recognizes in its accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P101_S5	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trust and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options Foreign currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value as it re-prices at varying interest rates.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	ASC 825 Financial Instruments ( ASC 825 ) permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P108_S2	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P108_S3	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Determination of Fair Value The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P112_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P112_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Money Market and Open-End Mutual Funds The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of money market and open-end mutual funds, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Options The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over the counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P116_S2	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	The investment assets of the rabbi trust are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 13, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, and Note 26, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Guaranteed Investment Certificates Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Foreign Currency and Derivative Instruments The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	The Company generally utilizes non-deliverable forward contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P120_S3	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P124_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, or if the Company de-designates a derivative as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S4	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S5	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S6	All changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Other income (expense) .
1010612_15_ITEM15_P128_S7	See Note 12, Financial Derivatives, for further information on financial derivative instruments.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	Certain balances in prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-08 indicate that only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P130_S2	Currently, a component of an entity that is a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary, or an asset group is eligible for discontinued operations presentation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P130_S3	The amendments should be applied to all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The adoption of ASU 2014-08 on January 1, 2015 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P131_S2	The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and indicate that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P131_S3	To achieve this, an entity should identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P131_S4	The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P133_S2	A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P133_S3	The amendments are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P133_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-12 to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	This amendment eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items as part of the FASB s initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P134_S2	The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P134_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05 Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity ( ASU 2013-05 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 indicate that a cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) is attached to the parent s investment in a foreign entity and should be released in a manner consistent with the derecognition guidance on investments in entities.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S2	Thus, the entire amount of the CTA associated with the foreign entity would be released when there has been a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, a loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity (i.e., the foreign entity is deconsolidated), or a step acquisition for a foreign entity (i.e., when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S3	ASU 2013-05 does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the CTA of the foreign entity into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S4	The amendments in ASU 2013-05 are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P135_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-05 on January 1, 2014 did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU 2013-11 ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 indicate that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P137_S2	In situations where a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P138_S2	The adoption of ASU 2013-11 on January 1, 2014 resulted in a $3.1 million reclassification of a portion of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits from Long-term income tax liabilities to Deferred charges and other assets.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P138_S3	See Note 22, Income Taxes, for further information.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	On August 20, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of Alpine, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	Alpine, an industry leader in the virtual at-home agent space, provides award-winning customer contact management services through a secured and proprietary virtual call center environment with its operations located in the United States and Canada.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	The results of Alpine s operations have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements since its acquisition on August 20, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S2	The Company acquired Alpine to: create significant competitive differentiation for quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility driven by proprietary, internally-developed software, systems, processes and other intellectual property, which uniquely overcome the challenges of the virtual at-home agent delivery model; strengthen the Company s current service portfolio and go-to-market offering while expanding the breadth of clients with minimal client overlap; broaden the addressable market opportunity within existing and new verticals as well as clients; expand the addressable pool of skilled labor; leverage operational best practices across the Company s global platform, with the potential to convert more of its fixed costs to variable costs; and further enhance the growth and margin profile of the Company to drive shareholder value.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S3	This resulted in the Company paying a substantial premium for Alpine resulting in the recognition of goodwill.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S4	The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $149.0 million, which was funded through cash on hand of $41.0 million and borrowings of $108.0 million under the Company s credit agreement, dated May 3, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P140_S5	See Note 20, Borrowings, for further information.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price paid was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Alpine based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P141_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the final working capital adjustment was approved by the authorized representative of Alpine s shareholders.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P141_S2	The Company finalized its purchase price allocation during the three months ended December 31, 2012, resulting in no changes from the estimated acquisition date fair values previously reported.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P141_S3	The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all included in the Americas segment (in thousands):
1010612_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	(1) Primarily includes long-term deferred tax liabilities.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	Fair values were based on management s estimates and assumptions including variations of the income approach, the cost approach and the market approach.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	The following table presents the Company s purchased intangibles assets as of August 20, 2012, the acquisition date (in thousands): The $80.8 million of goodwill was assigned to the Company s Americas operating segment.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	Pursuant to Federal income tax regulations, no amount of intangibles or goodwill from this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S2	The fair value of receivables purchased was $11.8 million, with the gross contractual amount of $11.8 million.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S3	The amount of Alpine s revenues and net loss since the August 20, 2012 acquisition date, included in the Company s accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was as follows (in thousands): The loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $3.2 million includes $3.6 million in severance costs, depreciation resulting from the adjustment to fair value of the acquired property and equipment, and amortization of the fair values of the acquired intangibles.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S4	The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined revenues and net earnings as if Alpine had been included in the consolidated results of the Company for the entire year for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S5	The pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and related borrowings had taken place on January 1, 2012 (in thousands):
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S6	These amounts have been calculated to reflect the additional depreciation, amortization and interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the fair value adjustments and borrowings occurred on January 1, 2012, together with the consequential tax effects.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S7	In addition, these amounts exclude costs incurred which are directly attributable to the acquisition, and which do not have a continuing impact on the combined companies operating results.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P144_S8	Included in these costs are severance, advisory and legal costs, net of the tax effects.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	Merger and integration costs associated with Alpine were as follows (none in 2014) (in thousands):
1010612_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	(1) In the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	In November 2011, the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board ) of the Company approved a plan to sell its Spanish operations, which were operated through its Spanish subsidiary, Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated S.L. ( Sykes Spain ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	Sykes Spain operated customer contact management centers, providing contact center services through a total of three customer contact management centers in Spain to clients in Spain.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	The decision to sell the Spanish operations was made in 2011 after management completed a strategic review of the Spanish market and determined the operations were no longer consistent with the Company s strategic direction.

1010612_15_ITEM15_P238_S3	The SARs have a term of 10 years from the date of grant.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P238_S4	In the event of a change in control, the SARs will vest on the date of the change in control, provided that the participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.

1010612_15_ITEM15_P238_S6	If the participant s employment is terminated for cause, or the participant terminates his or her own employment with the Company, any portion of the SARs not yet exercised (whether or not vested) terminates immediately on the date of termination of employment.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	The fair value of each SAR is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses various assumptions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P239_S1	The fair value of the SARs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	Exercises and forfeitures are estimated within the valuation model using employee termination and other historical data.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	The expected term of the SARs granted represents the period of time the SARs are expected to be outstanding.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P242_S1	The following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of SARs granted:

1010612_15_ITEM15_P247_S1	In some instances, where the issuance of restricted shares has adverse tax consequences to the recipient, the Board may instead issue restricted stock units ( RSUs ).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P247_S2	The restricted shares are shares of the Company s common stock (or in the case of RSUs, represent an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock) which are issued to the participant subject to (a) restrictions on transfer for a period of time and (b) forfeiture under certain conditions.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The performance goals, including revenue growth and income from operations targets, provide a range of vesting possibilities from 0% to 100% and will be measured at the end of the performance period.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	If the performance conditions are met for the performance period, the shares will vest and all restrictions on the transfer of the restricted shares will lapse (or in the case of RSUs, an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock will be issued to the recipient).
1010612_15_ITEM15_P248_S2	The Company recognizes compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the fair value (which approximates the current market price) of the restricted shares (and RSUs) on the date of grant ratably over the requisite service period based on the probability of achieving the performance goals.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P248_S3	Changes in the probability of achieving the performance goals from period to period will result in corresponding changes in compensation expense.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	The employment-based restricted shares currently outstanding vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the participant is employed by the Company on such date.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P249_S1	In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2011 Plan and 2001 Plan) prior to the date the restricted shares vest, all of the restricted shares will vest and the restrictions on transfer will lapse with respect to such vested shares on the date of the change in control, provided that participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.
1010612_15_ITEM15_P249_S2	If the participant s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, either by the Company or participant, prior to the date on which the restricted shares have vested and the restrictions have lapsed with respect to such vested shares, any restricted shares remaining subject to the restrictions (together with any dividends paid thereon) will be forfeited, unless there has been a change in control prior to such date.

1010612_15_ITEM15_P252_S6	The award lapses with respect to all unpaid cash and unvested shares in the event the non-employee director ceases to be a director of the Company, and any unvested shares and unpaid cash are forfeited.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	In July 2015, we completed the acquisition of Qelp B.V. and its subsidiary (together, known as Qelp ), pursuant to definitive Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated July 2, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P1_S4	The Company has reflected the operating results in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 2, 2015 to December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other materials which are filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) are made available, free of charge, on or through our Internet website at www.sykes.com (click on Company then Investor Relations and then SEC Filings under the heading Financial Reports and Filings ) as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	The customer contact management industry is highly fragmented and significant in size.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	According to Ovum, an industry research firm, the total number of individuals, or agent positions, working in the customer contact management industry worldwide was estimated at roughly 9.9 million in 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	With approximately 78% of the customer contact work done by in-house contact centers, the number of agent positions working for outsourcers, such as SYKES, was estimated at 2.1 million in 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	Both the outsourced and total agent positions are forecasted by Ovum to grow at compound annual growth rate of 5.4% and 2.0%, respectively, from 2015 to 2018.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S4	It is estimated that no single outsourcer has more than five percent of the total agent positions worldwide.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S5	Measured in dollar terms, the size of the outsourced portion of the customer contact management industry worldwide was estimated at approximately $68 billion in 2015, according to International Data Corporation ( IDC ), an industry research firm.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S6	IDC also estimates that the outsourced portion of the customer contact industry is expected to grow to approximately $81 billion by 2018, a compound annual growth rate of 6.0% from 2015 to 2018.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P3_S7	We believe that growth for outsourced customer contact management solutions and services will be fueled by the trend of Global 2000 companies and medium-sized businesses utilizing outsourcers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	companies require innovative customer contact management solutions that allow them to enhance the end user s experience with their products and services, strengthen and enhance their company brands, maximize the lifetime value of their customers, efficiently and effectively deliver human interaction when customers value it most, and deploy best-in-class customer management strategies, processes and technologies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	However, a myriad of factors, among them intense global competition, pricing pressures, softness in the global economy and rapid changes in technology, continue to make it difficult for companies to cost-effectively maintain the in-house personnel necessary to handle all of their customer contact management needs.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	To address these needs, we offer comprehensive global customer contact management solutions that leverage brick-and-mortar and virtual at-home agent delivery infrastructure as well as digital self-service capabilities.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	We provide consistent high-value support for our clients customers across the globe in a multitude of languages, leveraging our dynamic, secure communications infrastructure and our global footprint that reaches across 20 countries.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	This global footprint includes established brick-and-mortar operations in both onshore and offshore geographies where companies have access to high-quality customer contact management solutions at lower costs compared to other markets.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S5	We further complement our brick-and-mortar global delivery model with a highly differentiated and ready-made best-in-class virtual at-home agent delivery model, which we acquired through the Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ) acquisition in August of 2012.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S6	In addition, through the acquisition of Qelp, we strengthened our service portfolio, which includes email, chat and social media, to provide digital self-service customer support.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S7	The acquisition of Qelp further differentiates our go-to-market strategy as it expands options for companies to best service their customers in their channel of choice to deliver an effortless customer experience.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P4_S8	By working in partnership with outsourcers, companies can ensure that the crucial task of retaining and growing their customer base is addressed while creating operating flexibility, enabling focus on their core competencies, ensuring service excellence and execution, achieving cost savings through a variable cost structure, leveraging scale, entering niche markets speedily, and efficiently allocating capital within their organizations.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our business strategy is to leverage this value proposition in order to capitalize on and increase our share of the large and underpenetrated addressable market opportunity for customer contact management services worldwide.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	We believe through successful execution of our business strategy, we could generate a healthy level of revenue growth and drive targeted long-term operating margins.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S5	To deliver on our long-term growth potential and operating margin objectives, we need to manage the key levers of our business strategy, the principles of which include the following: Build Long-Term Client Relationships Through Customer Service Excellence.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S6	We believe that providing high-value, high-quality service is critical in our clients decisions to outsource and in building long-term relationships with our clients.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S7	To ensure service excellence and consistency across each of our centers globally, we leverage a portfolio of techniques, including SYKES Science of Service .
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S8	This standard is a compilation of more than 30 years of experience and best practices.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P5_S9	Every customer contact management center strives to meet or exceed the standard, which addresses leadership, hiring and training, performance management down to the agent level, forecasting and scheduling, and the client relationship including continuous improvement, disaster recovery plans and feedback.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Increasing Share of Seats Within Existing Clients and Winning New Clients .
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	We provide customer contact management support to numerous multinational companies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	With this client list, we have the opportunity to grow our client base.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	We strive to achieve this by winning a greater share of our clients in-house seats as well as gaining share from our competitors by providing consistently high-quality service as clients continue to consolidate their vendor base.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, as we further leverage our highly differentiated virtual at-home agent delivery capability internationally, using our knowledge of verticals and business lines, we plan to win new clients as a way to broaden our base of growth.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	To mitigate the impact of any negative economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S7	We are targeting the following verticals for growth: communications, financial services, technology/consumer, healthcare and retail.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P6_S8	These verticals cover various business lines, including wireless services, broadband, retail banking, credit card/consumer fraud protection, content moderation, telemedicine and soft and hard goods retailers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Revenues and profitability growth are driven by increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing underutilized seat capacity as deemed necessary.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	With greater operating flexibility resulting from the Alpine acquisition, we can rationalize underutilized capacity more efficiently and drive capacity utilization rates.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Broadening At-Home Agent and Brick-and-Mortar Global Delivery Footprint.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues and profitability growth, where we deploy both the seat capacity and the virtual at-home agent delivery platform geographically is also important.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint and our virtual at-home agent delivery platform, we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer contact management needs globally as they enter new markets.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	At the end of 2015, our global delivery brick-and-mortar footprint spanned 20 countries while our virtual at-home agent delivery platform was recently launched in EMEA, building on our existing presence in 40 states and nine provinces within the U.S. and Canada, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we will continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S5	Multilingual customer support, sales and marketing, digital self-service support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S6	Additionally, with the rapid emergence of on-line communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and virtual at-home agent delivery platforms.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S7	Continue to Grow Our Business Organically and through Acquisitions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S8	We have grown our customer contact management outsourcing operations utilizing a strategy of both internal organic growth and external acquisitions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S9	Our organic growth and acquisition strategy is to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S10	Entry into The Philippines, El Salvador, Romania and Colombia are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S11	While the Alpine and Qelp acquisitions are examples of how we used an acquisition to augment and differentiate our delivery model, the ICT Group, Inc. ( ICT ) acquisition is an example of how we used an acquisition to gain overall size and critical mass in key verticals, clients and geographies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P8_S12	Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities .
1010612_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	Total revenues by segment from AT T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, were as follows (in thousands):
1010612_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have multiple distinct contracts with AT T spread across multiple lines of businesses, which expire at varying dates between 2016 and 2017.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We have historically renewed most of these contracts.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact our relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients, including AT T, could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Competition The industry in which we operate is global and, therefore, highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	While many companies provide customer contact management solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer contact management operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	When it is not the in-house operations of a client or potential client, our public and private direct competition includes 24/7 Customer, Alorica, Arise, Atento, Concentrix, Convergys, Expert Global Solutions, Groupe Acticall/Sitel, iQor, LiveOps, StarTek, Sutherland, Teleperformance, TeleTech, Transcom and Working Solutions, as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Infosys, Mahindra Satyam, Wipro and Xerox, among others.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P23_S6	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer contact management services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer contact management solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	We and our subsidiaries have registered various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including SYKES , REAL PEOPLE.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Employees As of January 31, 2016, we had approximately 54,550 employees worldwide, including 41,700 customer contact agents handling technical and customer support inquiries at our centers, 7,500 at-home customer contact agents handling technical and customer support inquiries, 5,100 in management, administration, information technology, finance, sales and marketing roles, 50 in enterprise support services and 200 in fulfillment services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our employees, with the exception of approximately 650 employees in Brazil and various European countries, are not union members and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S4	This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise to and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S5	Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S6	As such, competition for such personnel is intense.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P29_S7	Additionally, employee turnover in our industry is high.

1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about us, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Words such as may, expects, projects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P38_S5	All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the marketplace s continued receptivity to our terms and elements of services offered under our standardized contract for future bundled service offerings; our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer contact management centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our clients products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S5	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S6	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S7	For these reasons, among others, if unfavorable economic conditions persist or increase, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S8	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S9	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S10	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 48.5% of our consolidated revenues in 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S11	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S12	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S13	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S14	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P39_S15	Cyber-attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our business is heavily dependent upon our computer and voice technologies, systems and platforms.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our call centers and impede our ability to provide critical services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	While we take measures to protect the security of, and unauthorized access to, our systems, as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	While many companies provide outsourced customer contact management services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our competitors include both companies that possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer contact management services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer contact management services companies on price.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S7	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P43_S8	The concentration of customer support centers in certain geographies poses risks to our operations which could adversely affect our financial condition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Although we have call centers in many locations throughout the world, we have a concentration of centers in certain geographies outside of the U.S. and Canada, specifically The Philippines and Latin America.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our concentration of operations in those geographies is a result of our ability to access significant numbers of employees with certain language and other skills at costs that are advantageous.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	However, the concentration of business activities in any geographical area creates risks which could harm operations and our financial condition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	Certain risks, such as natural disasters, armed conflict and military or civil unrest, political instability and disease transmission, as well as the risk of interruption to our delivery systems, is magnified when the realization of these, or any other risks, would effect a large portion of our business at once, which may result in a disproportionate increase in operating costs.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P45_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Regardless of the outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer contact management services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Significant capital expenditures may be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Emergency interruption of customer contact management center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer contact management centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S6	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P51_S7	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers and, as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer contact centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short-term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P54_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer contact centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Some of our customer contact management centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we maintain customer contact management centers, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additionally, some of our customer contact management centers are located in jurisdictions subject to minimum wage regulations, which may result in increased wages in the future.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer contact management centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	The United States Congress has passed, and the President has signed into law, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ).
1010612_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including foreign currency and interest rate hedging transactions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission to promulgate rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Until the rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act are established, we cannot know how these regulations will affect us.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	The rules adopted by the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission may in the future impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges to reduce foreign exchange and interest rate uncertainty and thus protect cash flows.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	In addition, the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act s new requirements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	It is possible that the costs of such compliance will be passed on to customers such as us.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	At December 31, 2015, our international operations were conducted from 31 customer contact management centers located in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Egypt, Scotland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India and Australia.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Revenues from these international operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were 40.5%, 39.9%, and 38.7% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	We also conduct business from 14 customer contact management centers located in Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	International operations are subject to certain risks common to international activities, such as changes in foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, import/export license requirements, the imposition of trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador which expire at varying dates from 2016 through 2028.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences, the impact of which is not practicable to estimate due to the inherent complexity of estimating critical variables such as long-term future profitability, tax regulations and rates in the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $4.0 million, $2.7 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash balances of approximately $221.7 million held in international operations, most of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of certain foreign currency exchange exposures.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P63_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can take actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Additionally, our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risks is not secured by any collateral.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	Although each of the counterparty financial institutions with which we place hedging contracts are investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of the time of the placement, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability of any of our counterparties.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	If a counterparty to one or more of our hedge transactions were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor and our exposure at the time would depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	Our offshore delivery locations include The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, and while we have operated in global delivery markets since 1996, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct and expand such operations, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S4	In addition, as with all of our operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_16_ITEM1_P65_S5	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer contact management solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	We provide services to our clients customers in 20 countries around the world.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Violations of these various laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries as well as recently enacted statutory and regulatory requirements related to derivative transactions, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, or impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges, thereby threatening or limiting our ability or the financial benefit to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations, or the risks associated therewith.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Risks Related to Our Employees Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P69_S5	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S3	Our customer contact centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S4	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P70_S5	Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	Also, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	The actual integration of the company may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P71_S5	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate the acquired operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the companies.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	We recorded substantial goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as a result of the ICT, Alpine and Qelp acquisitions.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S4	We review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S5	We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill at least annually.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S6	Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S7	We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S8	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S9	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S10	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S11	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S12	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S13	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S14	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer contact management services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S15	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer contact management services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S16	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S17	Because we are a publicly-traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and extensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S18	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S19	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S20	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S21	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P74_S22	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 subjects us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements and disclosures, some of which have yet to be implemented by the SEC.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Compliance with these requirements may be costly and adversely affect our business.
1010612_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to our periodic or current reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	This facility currently serves as the headquarters for senior management and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition to our headquarters and the customer contact management centers ( centers ) used by our Americas and EMEA segments discussed below, we also have offices in several countries around the world which support our Americas and EMEA segments.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2015, excluding centers we have exited, we operated 68 centers that are classified as follows:
1010612_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	Fulfillment Centers We own or lease space for these centers and serve multiple clients in each facility.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2015, our centers were located in the following countries:
1010612_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new centers are available.
1010612_16_ITEM2_P3_S2	At December 31, 2015, our centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 79% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	that we have adequate legal defenses and/or when possible and appropriate, have provided adequate accruals related to those matters such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	the periods indicated, certain information as to the high and low intraday sale prices per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of the funds legally available when and if declared by the Board of Directors.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 10, 2016, there were 840 holders of record of the common stock.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	We estimate there were approximately 11,300 beneficial owners of our common stock.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Below is a summary of stock repurchases for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands, except average price per share).
1010612_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) All shares purchased as part of the repurchase plan publicly announced on August 18, 2011.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	Total number of shares approved for repurchase under the 2011 Repurchase Plan was 5.0 million with no expiration date.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	Five-Year Stock Performance Graph The following graph presents a comparison of the cumulative shareholder return on the common stock with the cumulative total return on the NASDAQ Computer and Data Processing Services Index, the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the S P Small Cap 600 and the SYKES Peer Group (as defined below).
1010612_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	The SYKES Peer Group is comprised of publicly traded companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from call center, customer care business, have similar business models to SYKES, and are those most commonly compared to SYKES by industry analysts following SYKES.

1010612_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	SYKES does not make or endorse any predictions as to the future stock performance.
1010612_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The information contained in the Stock Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or filed or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

1010612_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The results of operations of Qelp have been reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 2, 2015 to December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as the changes between the respective years:
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of revenues: 2015 Compared to 2014 Revenues Consolidated revenues decreased $41.2 million, or 3.1%, in 2015 from 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The decrease in Americas revenues was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $82.1 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $23.6 million, partially offset by higher volumes from existing contracts of $67.3 million and new contract sales of $13.0 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 44.5% of Americas revenues, compared to 38.9% in 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	The decrease in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to the negative foreign currency impact of $43.4 million and end-of-life client programs of $4.5 million, partially offset by higher volumes from existing contracts of $26.6 million and new contract sales of $5.4 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	On a consolidated basis, we had 41,100 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 100 seats from 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis remained unchanged at 79% in 2015 and 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S6	On a geographic segment basis, 35,100 seats were located in the Americas, an increase of 600 seats from 2014, and 6,000 seats were located in EMEA, a decrease of 500 seats from 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S7	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas as of December 31, 2015 was 79%, compared to 77% as of December 31, 2014, up primarily due to growth within new and existing clients.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S8	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA as of December 31, 2015 was 85%, compared to 90% as of December 31, 2014, down primarily due to lower demand in certain existing clients and the rationalization of seats in a highly utilized center due to a planned program expiration.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P8_S9	We strive to attain a capacity utilization of 85% at each of our locations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We plan to add 1,600 seats on a gross basis in the first quarter of 2016, with total gross seats of 5,700 planned for the full year.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	However, we plan to rationalize 1,600 seats in 2016, with 500 expected in the first quarter of 2016.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Total seat count on a net basis for the full year is expected to increase by 4,100 seats in 2016 versus 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Direct Salaries and Related Costs The decrease of $55.6 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $25.8 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $31.0 million in EMEA.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	The decrease in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 2.2% driven by increased agent productivity within the communications, financial services and technology verticals in the current period, and lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.7% driven by increased agent productivity in the current period combined with the ramp up in the prior period for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, lower billable supply costs of 0.4%, lower postage costs of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher fulfillment materials costs of 1.8% driven by higher demand in a new client program.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	General and Administrative The decrease of $0.9 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $6.0 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $8.7 million in EMEA.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S7	The increase in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees of 0.3% and lower communication costs of 0.1%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S8	The increase in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher facility-related costs of 0.2%, higher severance costs of 0.2% and higher consulting costs of 0.2%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P9_S9	The increase of $5.1 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of $4.3 million, higher consulting costs of $1.2 million, higher software maintenance costs of $1.0 million, higher travel costs of $0.7 million and higher merger and integration costs of $0.5 million, partially offset by lower charitable contributions costs of $1.4 million and lower other costs of $1.2 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	The decrease in depreciation was primarily due to certain fully depreciated net fixed assets.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The decrease in amortization was primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment in 2014 primarily related to the sale of land, a building and fixed assets located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Other Income (Expense) The decrease in interest income reflects lower average interest rates on invested balances of interest-bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents in 2015 compared to 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in interest (expense) was primarily due to interest accretion on the contingent consideration related to the July 2015 Qelp acquisition.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	The (loss) on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries in 2015 was due to the substantial liquidation of operations in a foreign entity.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 million previously unrecognized tax benefit and a $1.3 million reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not the assets will be realized.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	This decrease was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in tax provision due to a $12.6 million income increase in a high tax rate jurisdiction.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The change in the effective tax rate was also affected by several other factors, including fluctuations in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Compared to 2013 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $64.1 million, or 5.1%, in 2014 from 2013.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to higher volumes from existing contracts of $89.9 million and new contract sales of $4.3 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $50.4 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $23.8 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 38.9% of Americas revenues, compared to 39.5% in 2013.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	The increase in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to higher volumes from existing contracts of $49.6 million and new contract sales of $2.2 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $4.6 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $3.1 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Direct Salaries and Related Costs The increase of $36.8 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $23.1 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $2.1 million in EMEA.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	The decrease in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower auto tow claim costs of 0.3%, lower compensation costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P14_S6	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.6% driven by the increase in new client program ramp up costs in the prior period in the communications vertical as well as new client program growth within the technology vertical, and lower billable supply costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher communications costs of 0.3%, higher fulfillment materials costs of 0.3% and higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase of $0.6 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $5.5 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $0.4 million in EMEA.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The decrease in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower facility-related costs of 0.6%, lower merger and integration costs of 0.1% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower facility-related costs of 0.9%, lower compensation costs of 0.5%, lower travel costs of 0.3%, lower communications costs of 0.2% and lower other costs of 0.2%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	The increase of $3.7 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of $1.9 million, higher charitable contributions of $1.4 million, higher legal and professional fees of $0.7 million, higher consulting costs of $0.5 million, higher facility-related costs of $0.2 million and higher insurance costs of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower merger and integration costs of $0.6 million, lower software maintenance costs of $0.4 million and lower other costs of $0.2 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to net fixed asset additions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The decrease in amortization was primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment in 2014 primarily related to the sale of land, a building and fixed assets located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the amount of average invested funds in 2014 compared to 2013.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The decrease in interest (expense) was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of average outstanding borrowings in 2014 compared to 2013.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to a $23.0 million increase in income in a high tax rate jurisdiction which increased the tax provision by $6.3 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in foreign withholding taxes recognized in 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The remaining change is due to several factors, including fluctuations in earnings among the various other jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results for 2015 and 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	(1) The quarter ended September 30, 2015 includes $0.5 million in Qelp acquisition-related costs and a $0.9 million net gain on insurance settlement.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	See Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 12, Property and Equipment, for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	(3) The quarter ended December 31, 2014 includes a $2.6 million (gain) on the sale of fixed assets, land and building located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	(4) The quarter ended December 31, 2015 includes $(0.4) million of interest accretion on contingent consideration.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	See Note 4, Fair Value, for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	(5) The quarter ended December 31, 2015 includes a $(0.6) million loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	See Note 26, Other Income (Expense), for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	(6) Net income per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Business Outlook For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continue to monitor the recent macro-economic volatility and assess its impact on consumer sentiment, final demand and client forecasts.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Client forecasts, on balance, thus far indicate acceleration in demand in 2016 compared to 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	At a broad level, this increased demand is being driven by a shift to outsourcing and share gains from competition, coupled with lower program completions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	More specifically, it is manifesting mostly within existing clients and programs across the financial services, communications, technology and healthcare verticals.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	To service this demand, we anticipate adding seat capacity in 2016, roughly two-thirds of which is expected in the first half of 2016.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	In accordance with the front-end loaded capacity additions, the Company expects program ramp costs to disproportionately impact operating margins in the first half of 2016.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S6	The business outlook also reflects the impact of foreign exchange volatility, which is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $30 million for the full-year of 2016 versus 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S7	Diluted earnings per share for 2016 reflect a materially higher effective tax rate relative to 2015 partly due to discrete adjustments, which lowered the effective tax rate in 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P28_S8	In addition, the higher effective tax rate in 2016 also reflects a shift in the mix of pre-tax income to higher tax rate jurisdictions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our revenues and earnings per share assumptions for the first quarter and full-year 2016 are based on foreign exchange rates as of February 2016.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Therefore, the continued volatility in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the functional currencies of the markets we serve could have a further impact, positive or negative, on revenues and earnings per share relative to the business outlook for the first quarter and full-year, as discussed above.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We anticipate total other interest income (expense), net of approximately $(1.0) million for the first quarter and $(4.0) million for the full year 2016.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	These amounts include the interest accretion on the contingent consideration, which is expected to be $(0.2) million in the first quarter of 2016 and approximately $(1.0) million for the year.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The amounts, however, exclude the potential impact of any future foreign exchange gains or losses in other income (expense).
1010612_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions, share repurchase activities or a potential sale of previously exited customer contact management centers.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	On August 18, 2011, the Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	A total of 4.9 million shares have been repurchased under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program since inception.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	During 2015, cash increased $120.5 million from operating activities, $0.6 million from the proceeds from sale of property and equipment, $1.5 million proceeds from insurance settlement, $5.0 million proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $0.4 million in excess tax benefits from stock compensation and $0.7 million from proceeds from grants.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Further, we used $49.7 million for capital expenditures, $9.4 million for the Qelp acquisition, $10.0 million to repay long-term debt, $20.9 million to repurchase our common stock, $0.3 million to repay short-term debt, $3.3 million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards and $1.0 million for loan fees related to long-term debt, resulting in a $20.2 million increase in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $13.9 million).
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2015 were $120.5 million, compared to $94.3 million in 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S7	The $26.2 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a $10.8 million increase in net income, a net increase of $14.7 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities and a $0.7 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on the sale of discontinued operations, net (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S8	The $14.7 million increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $42.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $9.8 million decrease in other liabilities, an $8.3 million decrease in taxes payable, a $5.3 million increase in other assets and a $4.7 million decrease in deferred revenue.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P32_S9	The $42.8 million decrease in the change in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of billings and collections in 2015 over 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $49.7 million for 2015, compared to $44.7 million for 2014, an increase of $5.0 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $60.0 million to $70.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, Enterprise Resource Planning upgrades, facility upgrades, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	On May 12, 2015, we entered into a $440 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender ( KeyBank ).
1010612_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	The 2015 Credit Agreement replaced our previous $245 million revolving credit facility dated May 3, 2012, as amended, which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The 2015 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2015 Credit Agreement and had $70.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our credit agreements had an average daily utilization of $70.0 million, $85.9 million and $102.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the related interest expense, including the commitment fee and excluding the amortization of deferred loan fees, was $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	The 2015 Credit Agreement includes a $200 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2015 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S6	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S7	The 2015 Credit Agreement will mature on May 12, 2020.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S8	Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either LIBOR or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company s leverage ratio.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S9	The applicable interest rate will be determined quarterly based on the Company s leverage ratio at such time.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S10	The base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest established by KeyBank, from time to time, as its prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate in effect from time to time, plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; and (iii) the then-applicable LIBOR rate for one month interest periods, plus 1.00%.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S11	Swingline loans will bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S12	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.125%, which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S13	The 2015 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S14	We are currently under audit in several tax jurisdictions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S15	We received assessments for the Canadian 2003-2009 audit.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S16	Requests for Competent Authority Assistance were filed with both the Canadian Revenue Agency and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and we paid mandatory security deposits to Canada as part of this process.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S17	The total amount of deposits, net of the effects of foreign exchange rate adjustments, were $13.4 million and $15.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S18	Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain, we believe we are adequately reserved for these audits and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S19	As of December 31, 2015, we had $235.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 94.2%, or $221.7 million, was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P35_S20	These funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	We do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	However, from time to time, we may borrow funds under our 2015 Credit Agreement as a result of the timing of our working capital needs, including capital expenditures.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Additionally, we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	If we should require more cash in the U.S. than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and/or raise capital in the U.S through additional borrowings or debt/equity issuances.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, interest expense and/or dilution of earnings.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	At December 31, 2015, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P41_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2015, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our purchase obligations, which include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits, which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilties, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	(6) Amount represents total outstanding borrowings.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	See Note 18, Borrowings, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	(7) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 20, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Long-term income tax liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The amount in the table has been reduced by Canadian mandatory security deposits of $13.4 million, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $5.1 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments for contingent consideration related to the Qelp acquisition, cash payments due under restructuring accruals for lease obligations and pension obligations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	See Note 2, Acquisitions, Note 3, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, and Note 23, Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.6%, 1.4% and 1.3% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ) (as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ) ( ASU 2009-13 ), we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Once we allocate revenue to each deliverable, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2015, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, we have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $3.6 million as of December 31, 2015, or 1.3% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $30.1 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $0.7 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $29.4 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $9.1 million as of December 31, 2015 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2015, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $399.0 million as of December 31, 2015, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $5.2 million from $13.3 million as of December 31, 2014.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S6	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $8.1 million and $13.3 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P66_S7	We do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2028.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $4.0 million, $2.7 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, which had a carrying value of $162.9 million as of December 31, 2015, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill, which had a carrying value of $195.7 million as of December 31, 2015, for impairment at least annually, during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	To assess the realizability of goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We may elect to forgo this option and proceed to the annual two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment and it indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value, or we elect to forgo this qualitative assessment, we will proceed to Step 1 testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability-weighted cash flows.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	If Step 1 indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, we will proceed to Step 2 where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as it would in a business combination.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in Step 2.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	In estimating future cash flows, we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization, projected changes in the prices we charge for our services, projected labor costs, as well as contract negotiation status.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	We use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the services are being provided.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	If actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower, causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Contingencies We record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Each quarter, management reviews all litigation and claims on a case-by-case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Other We have made certain other estimates that, while not involving the same degree of judgment, are important to understanding our financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	These estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self-insurance accruals.
1010612_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	See Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than USD are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Movements in non-USD currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in certain earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We also utilize derivative contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables that are denominated in a foreign currency and to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer contact management center capacity in The Philippines and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ) and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ), with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints and Romanian Leis.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP and CRC, we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2015 with counterparties through December 2016 with notional amounts totaling $106.3 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of $0.1 million, which will settle within the next 12 months.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $8.4 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $63.5 million to hedge net investments in our foreign operations.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against the risk that the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and economic exposures related to our foreign currency-based investments in these subsidiaries.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $10.2 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2015, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $5.3 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We also entered into forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $50.6 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of $0.2 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2015, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $3.5 million.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P5_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P6_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2015, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $0.7 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S6	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This report appears on page 42.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_16_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	In July 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Qelp B.V. and its subsidiary (together, known as Qelp ), pursuant to definitive Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated July 2, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company has reflected the operating results in the Consolidated Statements of Operations since July 2, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	See Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information on the acquisition.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SYKES and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP ) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Subsequent Events Subsequent events or transactions have been evaluated through the date and time of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Recognition of Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605 Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company primarily recognizes revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S4	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 1.6%, 1.4% and 1.3% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S5	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P71_S6	[as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2009-13 )], the Company determines if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S4	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P72_S5	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Estimated selling price is based on the Company s best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Once the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable, the Company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the Company s fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, the Company had no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term investments.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Cash in the amount of $235.4 million and $215.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was primarily held in interest bearing investments, which have original maturities of less than 90 days.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	Cash and cash equivalents of $221.7 million and $194.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States ( U.S. ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash includes cash whereby the Company s ability to use the funds at any time is contractually limited or is generally designated for specific purposes arising out of certain contractual or other obligations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade account receivables for estimated losses arising from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company s estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of the Company s trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of the Company s clients.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	Cost and related accumulated depreciation on assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred, if any, to internally develop software upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment .
1010612_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows (the reporting unit ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets or independent third party offers.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P81_S3	Occasionally, the Company redeploys property and equipment from under-utilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the under-utilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P81_S4	The Company determined that its property and equipment were not impaired as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Rent Expense The Company has entered into operating lease agreements, some of which contain provisions for future rent increases, rent free periods, or periods in which rent payments are reduced.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	The total amount of the rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC 840 Leases.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company expects to receive future benefits from previously acquired goodwill over an indefinite period of time.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	For goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the third quarter, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P84_S3	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or changes in circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	Fair value for intangible assets is based on discounted cash flows, market multiples and/or appraised values, as appropriate.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ) which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in accordance with the criteria of ASC 740.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets due to an uncertainty of realization.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P87_S3	Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence, in accordance with criteria of ASC 740, to support a change in judgment about the ability to realize the related deferred tax assets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	Uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in its tax returns, and records a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company self-insures for certain levels of workers compensation and self-funds the medical, prescription drug and dental benefit plans in the United States.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P92_S1	Estimated costs are accrued at the projected settlements for known and anticipated claims.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P92_S2	Amounts related to these self-insurance programs are included in Accrued employee compensation and benefits and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	Deferred Grants Recognition of income associated with grants for land and the acquisition of property, buildings and equipment (together, property grants ) is deferred until after the completion and occupancy of the building and title has passed to the Company, and the funds have been released from escrow.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	The deferred amounts for both land and building are amortized and recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	equipment and, only after the grants are released from escrow, recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the weighted average useful life of the related equipment, which approximates five years.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	Upon sale of the related facilities, any deferred grant balance is recognized in full and is included in the gain on sale of property and equipment.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company receives government employment grants as an incentive to create and maintain permanent employment positions for a specified time period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	These grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, if the Company s relevant employment levels do not meet or exceed the employment levels set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized primarily as a reduction to Direct salaries and related costs using the proportionate performance model over the required employment period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company receives government lease grants as an incentive for leasing space at specific locations or locating call centers in a government s jurisdiction.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	These grants are repayable, under certain terms and conditions, as set forth in the grant agreements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	Accordingly, grant monies received are deferred and amortized primarily as a reduction to rent expense included in General and administrative over the required lease period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company receives up-front fees in connection with certain contracts.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	The deferred revenue is earned over the service periods of the respective contracts, which range from 30 days to seven years.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets includes the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over the ensuing twelve month period and the up-front fees associated with services to be provided over multiple years in connection with contracts that contain cancellation and refund provisions, whereby the manufacturers or customers can terminate the contracts and demand pro-rata refunds of the up-front fees with short notice.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	Deferred revenue included in current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes estimated penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels in certain contracts and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company has three stock-based compensation plans: the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (for employees and certain non-employees), the Non-Employee Director Fee Plan (for non-employee directors), both approved by the shareholders, and the Deferred Compensation Plan (for certain eligible employees).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	All of these plans are discussed more fully in Note 24, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	Stock-based awards under these plans may consist of common stock, stock options, cash-settled or stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	The Company issues common stock and uses treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises or vesting of stock awards.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S4	In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company recognizes in its accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P98_S5	Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, while compensation expense for liability-based awards (those usually settled in cash rather than stock) is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the awards are settled.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1010612_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	Cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trust and accounts payable The carrying values for cash, short-term and other investments, investments held in rabbi trust and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts and options Foreign currency forward contracts and options, including premiums paid on options, are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	Long-term debt The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its estimated fair value as it re-prices at varying interest rates.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Contingent consideration Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value based on the discounted cash flow method.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	ASC 820-10-20 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	ASC 825 Financial Instruments ( ASC 825 ) permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Company has not elected to use the fair value option permitted under ASC 825 for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P106_S2	A description of the Company s policies regarding fair value measurement is summarized below.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Fair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10-35 requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P107_S2	This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P107_S3	These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
1010612_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable .
1010612_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	Determination of Fair Value The Company generally uses quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access to determine fair value, and classifies such items in Level 1.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P111_S3	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, etc.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P112_S2	Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	These items are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts and options The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and options over-the-counter and values such contracts using quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current market and model assumptions, including adjustments for credit risk.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	The key inputs include forward or option foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P115_S2	These items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Investments held in rabbi trust The investment assets of the rabbi trust are valued using quoted market prices in active markets, which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P116_S1	For additional information about the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 11, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, and Note 24, Stock-Based Compensation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	Guaranteed investment certificates Guaranteed investment certificates, with variable interest rates linked to the prime rate, approximate fair value due to the automatic ability to re-price with changes in the market; such items are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Contingent consideration The Company uses significant unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of contingent consideration, which is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	The contingent consideration was recognized at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology and a discount rate of 14.0%.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P118_S2	The discount rate is dependent on the specific risks of the acquisition including the country of operation, the nature of services and complexity of the acquired business, and other similar factors, all of which are significant inputs not observable in the market.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P118_S3	Significant increases or decreases in any of the inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date, and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	The net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income, but is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ), which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity until the sale or until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	Foreign Currency and Derivative Instruments The Company accounts for financial derivative instruments under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	The Company generally utilizes non-deliverable forward contracts and options expiring within one to 24 months to reduce its foreign currency exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional foreign currencies and net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P120_S2	In using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to counterparty credit risk.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P120_S3	The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow hedge); (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (3) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, until the forecasted underlying transactions occur.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	Any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within Revenues .
1010612_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective and designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI, offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of the Company s net investment in the foreign operation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	Any realized gains and losses from settlements of the net investment hedge remain in AOCI until partial or complete liquidation of the net investment.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Ineffectiveness is measured based on the change in fair value of the forward contracts and options and the fair value of the hypothetical derivatives with terms that match the critical terms of the risk being hedged.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized within Revenues for cash flow hedges and within Other income (expense) for net investment hedges.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	Cash flows from the derivative contracts are classified within the operating section in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective on a prospective and retrospective basis.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or if a forecasted hedge is no longer probable of occurring, or if the Company de-designates a derivative as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, all hedges were determined to be highly effective.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S4	The Company also periodically enters into forward contracts that are not designated as hedges as defined under ASC 815.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S5	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to reduce the effects from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange rates on the Company s operating results and cash flows.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P127_S6	Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are included in Revenues or Other income (expense) , depending on the underlying risk exposure.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The Company did not record any fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration as the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value at the acquisition date remained consistent at December 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P175_S1	Should the assumptions regarding probability of achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets change in future periods, the change in fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P175_S2	The Company accretes interest expense each period using the effective interest method until the contingent consideration reaches the estimated future value of $9.1 million.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P175_S3	Interest expense related to the contingent consideration is included in Interest (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	Certain assets, under certain conditions, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis utilizing Level 3 inputs, as described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, like those associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition would be applicable if these assets were determined to be impaired.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P176_S2	The adjusted carrying values for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (no liabilities) subject to the requirements of ASC 820 were not material at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	(1) See Note 2, Acquisitions, for further information.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	Changes in goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014 consist of the following (in thousands): The Company has five reporting units with goodwill and performs its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter, or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	For the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company elected to forgo the option to first assess qualitative factors and performed its annual two-step goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	Under ASC 350, the carrying value of assets is calculated at the reporting unit level.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	The quantitative assessment of goodwill includes comparing a reporting unit s calculated fair value to its carrying value.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	The calculation of fair value requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P180_S3	Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P180_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	The process of evaluating the fair value of the reporting units is highly subjective and requires significant judgment and estimates as the reporting units operate in a number of markets and geographical regions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P181_S1	The Company used an average of the income and market approaches to determine its best estimates of fair value which incorporated the following significant assumptions:
1010612_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	Discount rates based on various inputs, including the risks associated with the specific reporting units as well as their revenue growth and EBITDA margin assumptions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	As of July 31, 2015, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired for all five of the reporting units.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	While the fair values of four of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying value, the Qelp reporting unit s fair value approximated its carrying value due to the proximity to the acquisition date of July 2, 2015.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P182_S3	The newly acquired Qelp reporting unit s carrying value was $15.6 million at July 31, 2015, including $9.9 million of goodwill.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Qelp reporting unit is at considerable risk for future impairment if projected operating results are not met or other inputs into the fair value measurement change.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P183_S1	However, as of December 31, 2015, there is no impairment as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by a small margin.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company will continue to review the calculated fair value of this reporting unit until the fair value is substantially in excess of its carrying value.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P184_S1	The Company s credit concentrations are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company s services are sold.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	The Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and options (in thousands): Master netting agreements exist with each respective counterparty to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of derivative positions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P190_S1	In the event of default by the Company or one of its counterparties, these agreements include a set-off clause that provides the non-defaulting party the right to net settle all derivative transactions, regardless of the currency and settlement date.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P190_S2	The maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that, based on gross fair value, the Company would incur if parties to the derivative transactions that make up the concentration failed to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $11.0 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P190_S3	After consideration of these netting arrangements and offsetting positions by counterparty, the total net settlement amount as it relates to these positions are asset positions of $10.2 million and $4.4 million, and liability positions of $0.1 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	Although legally enforceable master netting arrangements exist between the Company and each counterparty, the Company has elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P207_S4	The Company is not currently aware of any inability of its lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the revolving credit facility, if necessary.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P207_S5	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to the Company, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P208_S2	The applicable interest rate will be determined quarterly based on the Company s leverage ratio at such time.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P208_S3	The base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest established by KeyBank, from time to time, as its prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate in effect from time to time, plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; and (iii) the then-applicable LIBOR rate for one month interest periods, plus 1.00%.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax provision computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company s effective income tax provision is as follows (in thousands): Withholding taxes on offshore cash movements assessed by certain foreign governments of $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $4.1 million were included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S2	Earnings associated with the investments in the Company s foreign subsidiaries of $399.0 million at December 31, 2015 are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S3	Therefore, a U.S. provision for income taxes on those earnings or translation adjustments has not been recorded, as permitted by criterion outlined in ASC 740 Income Taxes.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S4	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which the Company operates.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S5	The Company has been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S6	The tax holidays have various expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2028.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S7	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S8	In other cases, the Company expects to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P218_S9	This could potentially result in future adverse tax consequences in the local jurisdiction, the impact of which is not practicable to estimate due to the inherent complexity of estimating critical variables such as long-term future profitability, tax regulations and rates in the multi-national tax environment in which the Company operates.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company s tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $4.0 million ($0.09 per diluted share), $2.7 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and $4.7 million ($0.11 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income taxes.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	The temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below (in thousands): There are approximately $153.5 million of income tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015, with varying expiration dates, approximately $113.6 million relating to foreign operations and $39.9 million relating to U.S. state operations.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S2	With respect to foreign operations, $94.4 million of the net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite expiration date and the remaining $19.2 million net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates through December 2036.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S3	Regarding the U.S. state and foreign aforementioned tax loss carryforwards, no benefit has been recognized for $14.0 million and $104.0 million, respectively, as the Company does not anticipate that the losses will more likely than not be fully utilized.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S4	The Company has accrued $8.1 million and $13.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding penalties and interest, for the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S5	The decrease is primarily due to the recognition of $2.2 million of tax benefits resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations, as previously mentioned, and the effects of foreign exchange rate adjustments.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P220_S6	As of December 31, 2014, $2.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits were recorded to Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with ASU 2013-11 Income Taxes (Topic 740) Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P245_S2	SARs are granted at the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant and vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the participant is employed by the Company on such date.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P245_S3	The SARs have a term of 10 years from the date of grant.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P245_S4	In the event of a change in control, the SARs will vest on the date of the change in control, provided that the participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P245_S6	If the participant s employment is terminated for cause, or the participant terminates his or her own employment with the Company, any portion of the SARs not yet exercised (whether or not vested) terminates immediately on the date of termination of employment.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	The fair value of each SAR is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses various assumptions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P247_S1	The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	Exercises and forfeitures are estimated within the valuation model using employee termination and other historical data.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	The expected term of the SARs granted represents the period of time the SARs are expected to be outstanding.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P249_S1	The following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of SARs granted:

1010612_16_ITEM15_P252_S1	In some instances, where the issuance of restricted shares has adverse tax consequences to the recipient, the Board may instead issue restricted stock units ( RSUs ).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P252_S2	The restricted shares are shares of the Company s common stock (or in the case of RSUs, represent an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock) which are issued to the participant subject to (a) restrictions on transfer for a period of time and (b) forfeiture under certain conditions.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	The performance goals, including revenue growth and income from operations targets, provide a range of vesting possibilities from 0% to 100% and will be measured at the end of the performance period.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P253_S1	If the performance conditions are met for the performance period, the shares will vest and all restrictions on the transfer of the restricted shares will lapse (or in the case of RSUs, an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock will be issued to the recipient).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P253_S2	The Company recognizes compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the fair value (which approximates the current market price) of the restricted shares (and RSUs) on the date of grant ratably over the requisite service period based on the probability of achieving the performance goals.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P253_S3	Changes in the probability of achieving the performance goals from period to period will result in corresponding changes in compensation expense.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	The employment-based restricted shares currently outstanding vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the participant is employed by the Company on such date.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P254_S1	In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2011 Plan) prior to the date the restricted shares vest, all of the restricted shares will vest and the restrictions on transfer will lapse with respect to such vested shares on the date of the change in control, provided that participant is employed by the Company on the date of the change in control.
1010612_16_ITEM15_P254_S2	If the participant s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, either by the Company or participant, prior to the date on which the restricted shares have vested and the restrictions have lapsed with respect to such vested shares, any restricted shares remaining subject to the restrictions (together with any dividends paid thereon) will be forfeited, unless there has been a change in control prior to such date.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P256_S1	The initial grant of shares vested in twelve equal quarterly installments, one-twelfth on the date of grant and an additional one-twelfth on each successive third monthly anniversary of the date of grant.

1010612_16_ITEM15_P257_S5	In addition, the Amendment also changed the vesting period for the annual equity award, from a two-year vesting period, to a one-year vesting period (consisting of four equal quarterly installments, one-fourth on the date of grant and an additional one-fourth on each successive third monthly anniversary of the date of grant).
1010612_16_ITEM15_P257_S6	The award lapses with respect to all unpaid cash and unvested shares in the event the non-employee director ceases to be a director of the Company, and any unvested shares and unpaid cash are forfeited.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The customer engagement solutions and services industry which includes services such as digital marketing and demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support and customer retention is highly fragmented and significant in size.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	According to Ovum, an industry research firm, the total number of individuals, or agent positions, working in the customer engagement services industry worldwide was estimated at roughly 10.2 million in 2016.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing underutilized seat capacity as deemed necessary.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	With greater operating flexibility resulting from our at-home agent delivery model, we can rationalize underutilized capacity more efficiently and drive capacity utilization rates.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Broadening At-Home Agent and Brick-and-Mortar Global Delivery Footprint.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues and profitability growth, where we deploy both the seat capacity and the at-home agent delivery platform geographically is also important.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint and our at-home agent delivery platform, we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer engagement needs globally as they enter new markets.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	At the end of 2016, our global delivery brick-and-mortar footprint spanned 20 countries while our at-home agent delivery platform was recently launched in EMEA, building on our existing presence in 40 states and nine provinces within the U.S. and Canada, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S4	To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we will continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S5	Digital marketing and demand generation, multilingual customer support, digital self-service support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S6	Additionally, with the rapid emergence of on-line communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P10_S7	Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities .
1010612_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The United States, Canada and Germany, for instance, are markets which are served by in-country centers, centers in offshore regions or a combination thereof.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer engagement services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We currently operate in 14 markets.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Continue to Grow Our Business Organically and through Acquisitions.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	We have grown our customer engagement solutions and services utilizing a strategy of both internal organic growth and external acquisitions.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	Our organic growth and acquisition strategy is to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	Entry into The Philippines, El Salvador, Romania and Colombia are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	While the Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), Qelp and Clearlink acquisitions are examples of how we used acquisitions to augment our service offerings and differentiate our delivery model, the ICT Group, Inc. ( ICT ) acquisition is an example of how we used an acquisition to gain overall size and critical mass in key verticals, clients and geographies.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P12_S7	Strategic Rationale for the Clearlink Acquisition We completed the acquisition of Clearlink in April 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Clearlink is one of the leading inbound demand generation and sales conversion platforms serving numerous business-to-consumer and business-to-business clients across various industries and subsectors, including telecommunications, satellite television, home security and insurance.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Consumers are rapidly adopting and increasing their utilization of digital channels as a preferred method to engage with brands, whether that engagement is before, during, or after purchase.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Combining Clearlink s digital marketing, demand generation, and sales conversion model with our post-sales customer care and support capabilities allows us to provide the market with a unique and differentiated global customer interaction management platform that more effectively engages digital consumers at every touch point in the customer lifecycle.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Through the acquisition of Clearlink, we further:
1010612_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	created more entry points to capture new clients while extending our executive level reach within existing clients organizations.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	We specialize in providing comprehensive inbound outsourced customer engagement solutions and services in the BPO arena on a global basis.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	These services include digital marketing, demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support, technical support, up-sell/cross-sell and retention.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our comprehensive customer engagement solutions and services are provided through two reportable segments the Americas and EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Americas region, representing 83.6% of consolidated revenues in 2016, includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	The sites within Latin America and the Asia Pacific Rim are included in the Americas region as they provide a significant service delivery vehicle for U.S.-based companies that are utilizing our customer engagement solutions and services in these locations to support their customer care needs.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition, the Americas region also includes revenues from our at-home agent delivery solution, which serves markets in both the U.S. and Canada.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The EMEA region, representing 16.4% of consolidated revenues in 2016, includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P22_S5	We utilize a sophisticated workforce management system to provide efficient scheduling of personnel.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P22_S7	Through this network and our dynamic intelligent call routing capabilities, we can rapidly respond to changes in client call volumes and move call volume traffic based on agent availability and skill throughout our network of centers, improving the responsiveness and productivity of our agents.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P22_S8	We also can offer cost competitive solutions for taking calls to our offshore locations.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	The data warehouse supplies information for our performance management systems such as our agent scorecarding application, which provides us with the information required for effective management of our operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our customer engagement centers are protected by a fire extinguishing system, backup generators with significant capacity and 24 hour refueling contracts and short-term battery backups in the event of a power outage, reduced voltage or a power surge.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Security measures are imposed to prevent unauthorized physical access.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	We provide our fulfillment services primarily to certain clients operating in Europe who desire this complementary service in connection with outsourced customer engagement services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Our enterprise support services office, located in a metropolitan area in the United States, provides recruitment services for high-end knowledge workers, a local presence to service major accounts, and outsourced corporate help desk solutions.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing objective is to leverage our vertical expertise, global presence, and end-to-end lifecycle of service offerings to develop long-term relationships with existing and future clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our customer engagement solutions have been developed to help our clients market, acquire, retain and increase the lifetime value of their customer relationships.

1010612_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our sales force is composed of business development managers who pursue new business opportunities and strategic account managers who manage and grow relationships with existing accounts.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	to strengthen relationships with existing clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Business development management and strategic account managers are assigned to markets in their area of expertise in order to develop a complete understanding of each client s particular needs, to form strong client relationships and encourage cross-selling of our other service offerings.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	We have inside customer sales representatives who receive customer inquiries and who provide pre-sales relationship development for the business development managers.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	Utilizing best practices from our recent Clearlink acquisition, we are employing modern methods of search and digital marketing to cultivate interest in our brand and services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	We use a methodical approach to collecting client feedback through quarterly business reviews, annual strategic reviews, and through our bi-annual Voice of the Client program, which enables us to react to early warning signs, and quickly identify and remedy challenges.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S5	It also is used to highlight our most loyal clients, who we then work with to provide references, testimonials and joint speaking engagements at industry conferences.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P28_S6	As part of our marketing efforts, we invite existing and potential clients to experience our customer engagement centers and at-home agent delivery operations, where we can demonstrate the expertise of our skilled staff in partnering to deliver new ways of growing clients revenues, customer satisfaction and retention rates, and thus profit, through timely, insightful and proven solutions.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	This forum allows us to demonstrate our capabilities to design, launch and scale programs.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	It also allows us to illustrate our best innovations in talent management, analytics, and digital channels, and how they can be best integrated into a program s design.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Clients We provide service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe and Africa.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	These clients are Global 2000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the communications, financial services, technology/consumer, transportation and leisure, healthcare and other industries.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	Revenue by industry vertical for 2016, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 37% for communications, 24% for financial services, 18% for technology/consumer, 7% for transportation and leisure, 5% for healthcare, 3% for retail and 6% for all other verticals, including government and utilities.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S6	Total revenues by segment from AT T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, were as follows (in thousands): We have multiple distinct contracts with AT T spread across multiple lines of businesses, which expire at varying dates between 2017 and 2018.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S7	We have historically renewed most of these contracts.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P29_S8	However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact our relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients, including AT T, could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P30_S4	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under our contracts without penalty.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Total revenues by segment from our next largest client, which was in the financial services vertical in each of the years, were as follows (in thousands): Other than AT T, total revenues by segment of our clients that each individually represent 10% or greater of that segment s revenues in each of the years were as follows (in thousands): Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 49.2%, 48.5% and 46.8% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Competition The industry in which we operate is global and, therefore, highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer engagement operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	When it is not the in-house operations of a client or potential client, our public and private direct competition includes 24/7 Customer, Alorica, Arise, Atento, Concentrix, Convergys, Groupe Acticall/Sitel, iQor, LiveOps, StarTek, Sutherland, Teleperformance, TeleTech, Transcom and Working Solutions, as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S4	There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer engagement solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S5	Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P32_S6	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer engagement services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer engagement solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	We and our subsidiaries have registered various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including SYKES , REAL PEOPLE.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P34_S4	REAL SOLUTIONS , SYKES HOME , SYKES HOME POWERED BY ALPINE ACCESS , SCIENCE OF SERVICE , ALPINE ACCESS , ALPINE ACCESS UNIVERSITY , TALENTSPROUT , SECURE TALK , CLEARLINK , BUYCALLS , A SECURE LIFE , and LEADAMP .
1010612_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	renewed indefinitely as long as the marks are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	We have a pending U.S. patent application which relates to a system and method of analysis and recommendation for distributed employee management and digital collaboration.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our subsidiary, Alpine, was issued U.S. Patent No. 8,565,413 in 2013 which relates to a system and method for establishment and management of a remote agent engagement center.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	No. 9,100,484 in 2015 which relates to a secure call environment.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	Clearlink s subsidiary, LeadAmp, has a pending U.S. patent application which relates to lead management software.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Employees As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 55,525 employees worldwide, including 44,200 customer engagement agents handling technical and customer support inquiries at our centers, 5,200 at-home customer engagement agents handling technical and customer support inquiries, 6,000 in management, administration, information technology, finance, sales and marketing roles, 25 in enterprise support services and 100 in fulfillment services.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our employees, with the exception of approximately 500 employees in Brazil and various European countries, are not union members and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise to and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S5	Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S6	As such, competition for such personnel is intense.
1010612_17_ITEM1_P37_S7	Additionally, employee turnover in our industry is high.

1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about us, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words such as may, expects, projects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer engagement centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our clients products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	For these reasons, among others, if unfavorable economic conditions persist or increase, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 49.2% of our consolidated revenues in 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Cyber-attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is heavily dependent upon our computer and voice technologies, systems and platforms.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our engagement centers and impede our ability to provide critical services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	as well as the privacy of personal and proprietary information, it is possible that our security controls over our systems, as well as other security practices we follow, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or proprietary information.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	While many companies provide outsourced customer engagement services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	There are numerous and varied providers of our services, including firms specializing in engagement center operations, temporary staffing and personnel placement, consulting and integration firms, and niche providers of outsourced customer engagement services, many of whom compete in only certain markets.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our competitors include both companies that possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer engagement services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S9	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer engagement services companies on price.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S11	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P5_S12	The concentration of customer engagement centers in certain geographies poses risks to our operations which could adversely affect our financial condition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Although we have engagement centers in many locations throughout the world, we have a concentration of centers in certain geographies outside of the U.S. and Canada, specifically The Philippines and Latin America.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our concentration of operations in those geographies is a result of our ability to access significant numbers of employees with certain language and other skills at costs that are advantageous.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	However, the concentration of business activities in any geographical area creates risks which could harm operations and our financial condition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Certain risks, such as natural disasters, armed conflict and military or civil unrest, political instability and disease transmission, as well as the risk of interruption to our delivery systems, is magnified when the realization of these, or any other risks, would effect a large portion of our business at once, which may result in a disproportionate increase in operating costs.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer engagement services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer engagement services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer engagement services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Significant capital expenditures may be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Emergency interruption of customer engagement center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer engagement centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers and, as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer engagement centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short-term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer engagement centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Some of our customer engagement centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we maintain customer engagement centers, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Additionally, some of our customer engagement centers are located in jurisdictions subject to minimum wage regulations, which may result in increased wages in the future.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer engagement centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including foreign currency and interest rate hedging transactions.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission to promulgate rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Until the rules relating to the Dodd-Frank Act are established, we cannot know how these regulations will affect us.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The rules adopted by the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission may in the future impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges to reduce foreign exchange and interest rate uncertainty and thus protect cash flows.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act s new requirements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	It is possible that the costs of such compliance will be passed on to customers such as us.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	At December 31, 2016, our international operations were conducted from 34 customer engagement centers located in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Egypt, Scotland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India and Australia.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Revenues from these international operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 36.8%, 40.5%, and 39.9% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We also conduct business from 14 customer engagement centers located in Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, import/export license requirements, the imposition of trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador which expire at varying dates from 2019 through 2028.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences, the impact of which is not practicable to estimate due to the inherent complexity of estimating critical variables such as long-term future profitability, tax regulations and rates in the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $3.3 million, $4.0 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash balances of approximately $243.8 million held in international operations, most of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of certain foreign currency exchange exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	However, there can be no assurance that we can take actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Additionally, our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risks is not secured by any collateral.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Although each of the counterparty financial institutions with which we place hedging contracts are investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of the time of the placement, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability of any of our counterparties.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If a counterparty to one or more of our hedge transactions were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor and our exposure at the time would depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our offshore delivery locations include The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, and while we have operated in global delivery markets since 1996, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct and expand such operations, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, as with all of our operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer engagement solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We provide services to our clients customers in 20 countries around the world.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries as well as recently enacted statutory and regulatory requirements related to derivative transactions, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, or impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges, thereby threatening or limiting our ability or the financial benefit to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations, or the risks associated therewith.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Risks Related to Our Employees Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S8	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our customer engagement centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The actual integration of the company may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate the acquired operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the companies.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We recorded substantial goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as a result of the ICT, Alpine, Qelp and Clearlink acquisitions.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill at least annually.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S7	We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S10	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P38_S11	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer engagement services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer engagement services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Because we are a publicly-traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and extensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S9	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S10	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 subjects us to significant additional executive compensation and corporate governance requirements and disclosures, some of which have yet to be implemented by the SEC.
1010612_17_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Compliance with these requirements may be costly and adversely affect our business.

1010612_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new centers are available.
1010612_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	At December 31, 2016, our centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 75% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.

1010612_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	This decrease was due to a significant increase in the seat count related to projected client demand.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	On a geographic segment basis, 41,200 seats were located in the Americas, an increase of 6,100 seats from 2015, and 6,500 seats were located in EMEA, an increase of 500 seats from 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas in 2016 was 74%, compared to 79% in 2015, down primarily due to seat additions for higher projected demand.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA in 2016 was 80%, compared to 85% in 2015, down primarily due to lower demand in certain existing clients, certain end-of-life client programs and the rationalization of seats in a highly utilized center due to a planned program expiration.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P11_S8	We strive to attain a capacity utilization of 85% at each of our locations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Excluding Clearlink, we added 7,000 seats on a gross basis in 2016, with total seat count on a net basis for the full year increasing by 5,300 in 2016 versus 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The increase of $111.2 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $13.2 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $5.2 million in EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher customer-acquisition advertising costs of 2.3% in connection with Clearlink s operations and higher recruiting costs of 0.2%, partially offset by lower compensation costs of 1.3% driven by Clearlink s operations which has lower direct labor costs relative to our mix of business in the prior period, lower communication costs of 0.4%, lower auto tow claim costs of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower fulfillment materials costs of 2.2% driven by lower demand in an existing client program and lower postage costs of 0.6%, partially offset by higher compensation costs of 2.0% driven by a decrease in agent productivity principally within the technology vertical in the current period and higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The increase of $54.2 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $3.7 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $2.0 million in EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.9% and higher other costs of 0.5%, partially offset by a reduction in technology costs of 0.2% allocated from corporate.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	The decrease in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to a gain on settlement of Qelp s contingent consideration of 1.1%, lower facility-related costs of 0.6% and lower other costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher compensation costs of 0.6%, higher consulting costs of 0.2% and higher recruiting costs of 0.2%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	The increase of $9.0 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to higher merger and integration costs of $4.0 million, higher compensation costs of $2.6 million, a reduction in technology costs of $1.9 million allocated to the Americas, higher software maintenance costs of $0.5 million and higher consulting costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by lower other costs of $0.3 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to new depreciable fixed assets placed into service supporting site expansions as well as the addition of depreciable fixed assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, partially offset by certain fully depreciated fixed assets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition and the July 2015 Qelp acquisition, partially offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Interest income remained consistent with the prior year.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in interest (expense) was primarily due to $216.0 million in borrowings used to acquire Clearlink in April 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The (loss) on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries in 2015 was due to the substantial liquidation of operations in a foreign entity.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	The increase in other miscellaneous income (expense) was primarily due to the net investment income (losses) related to the investments held in rabbi trust.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	See Note 11, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income Taxes The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to the recognition in the prior period of a $2.2 million previously unrecognized tax benefit, inclusive of penalties and interest, arising from statute of limitations expirations and a $1.3 million reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not the assets will be realized due to the current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate was also affected by several additional factors, including increases in state taxation along with shifts in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Consolidated revenues decreased $41.2 million, or 3.1%, in 2015 from 2014.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The decrease in Americas revenues was primarily due to end-of-life client programs of $82.1 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $23.6 million, partially offset by higher volumes from existing clients of $67.3 million and new client sales of $13.0 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 44.5% of Americas revenues, compared to 38.9% in 2014.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	The decrease in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to the negative foreign currency impact of $43.4 million and end-of-life client programs of $4.5 million, partially offset by higher volumes from existing clients of $26.6 million and new client sales of $5.4 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	On a consolidated basis, we had 41,100 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 100 seats from 2014.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis remained unchanged at 79% in 2015 and 2014.

1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas as of December 31, 2015 was 79%, compared to 77% as of December 31, 2014, up primarily due to growth within new and existing clients.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S8	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA as of December 31, 2015 was 85%, compared to 90% as of December 31, 2014, down primarily due to lower demand in certain existing clients and the rationalization of seats in a highly utilized center due to a planned program expiration.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P18_S9	We strive to attain a capacity utilization of 85% at each of our locations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease of $55.6 million in direct salaries and related costs included a positive foreign currency impact of $25.8 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $31.0 million in EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 2.2% driven by increased agent productivity within the communications, financial services and technology verticals in the current period, and lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The decrease in EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to lower compensation costs of 1.7% driven by increased agent productivity in the current period combined with the ramp up in the prior period for new and existing client programs principally in the communications vertical, lower billable supply costs of 0.4%, lower postage costs of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher fulfillment materials costs of 1.8% driven by higher demand in a new client program.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	General and Administrative The decrease of $0.9 million in general and administrative expenses included a positive foreign currency impact of $6.0 million in the Americas and a positive foreign currency impact of $8.7 million in EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	The increase in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.3%, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees of 0.3% and lower communication costs of 0.1%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S5	The increase in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher facility-related costs of 0.2%, higher severance costs of 0.2% and higher consulting costs of 0.2%.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P19_S6	The increase of $5.1 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of $4.3 million, higher consulting costs of $1.2 million, higher software maintenance costs of $1.0 million, higher travel costs of $0.7 million and higher merger and integration costs of $0.5 million, partially offset by lower charitable contributions costs of $1.4 million and lower other costs of $1.2 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The decrease in depreciation was primarily due to certain fully depreciated net fixed assets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The decrease in amortization was primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	The net (gain) on disposal of property and equipment in 2014 primarily related to the sale of land, a building and fixed assets located in Bismarck, North Dakota.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Other Income (Expense) The decrease in interest income reflects lower average interest rates on invested balances of interest-bearing investments in cash and cash equivalents in 2015 compared to 2014.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase in interest (expense) was primarily due to interest accretion on the contingent consideration related to the July 2015 Qelp acquisition.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	The (loss) on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries in 2015 was due to the substantial liquidation of operations in a foreign entity.

1010612_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	See Note 11, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Income Taxes The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 million previously unrecognized tax benefit and a $1.3 million reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not the assets will be realized.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	This decrease was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in tax provision due to a $12.6 million income increase in a high tax rate jurisdiction.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	The change in the effective tax rate was also affected by several other factors, including fluctuations in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results for 2016 and 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	(2) The quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a $0.5 million loss on contingent consideration.

1010612_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	(4) The quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a $0.2 million (gain) on the sale of fixed assets, land and building located in Morganfield, Kentucky.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	(6) The quarter ended December 31, 2015 includes a $(0.6) million loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	See Note 26, Other Income (Expense), for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	(7) Net income per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Business Outlook For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	In 2017, we expect a continuation of the favorable underlying demand trends experienced in 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	This underlying demand is being driven by growth with both existing and new clients across the Americas and EMEA.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Specifically, the main drivers of growth remain the financial services, communications and technology verticals.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Revenues in 2017 reflect an unfavorable impact of approximately $25 million from foreign exchange rates relative to 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Given the broader macro-economic environment and the sustained demand growth, we have seen some imbalances in labor and wage dynamics, which we should be able to either mitigate or completely offset through a combination of actions, including some wage increases offset by lower attrition, wage pass-throughs, shifts in delivery strategies and productivity.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	As a result, our implicit operating margin and explicit diluted earnings per share assumptions reflect manageable macro-economic backdrop and operational progress related to staffing inefficiencies from significant capacity additions and sizeable program ramps in 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our revenues and earnings per share assumptions for the first quarter and full-year 2017 are based on foreign exchange rates as of February 2017.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Therefore, the continued volatility in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the functional currencies of the markets we serve could have a further impact, positive or negative, on revenues and earnings per share relative to the business outlook for the first quarter and full-year, as discussed above.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	We anticipate total other interest income (expense), net of approximately $(1.5) million for the first quarter and $(6.0) million for the full year 2017.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	These amounts include the interest accretion on the contingent consideration, which is expected to be less than $(0.1) million in the first quarter of 2017 and approximately $(0.1) million for the year.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The amounts, however, exclude the potential impact of any future foreign exchange gains or losses in other income (expense).
1010612_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions, share repurchase activities or a potential sale of previously exited customer engagement centers.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer engagement services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	On August 18, 2011, the Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	On March 16, 2016, the Board authorized an increase of 5.0 million shares to the 2011 Share Repurchase Program, for a total of 10.0 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	repurchased under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program since inception.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	During 2016, cash increased $130.7 million from operating activities, $216.0 from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $10.3 million from the settlement of the net investment hedge, $2.1 million from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, $0.6 million from proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, $0.3 million release of restricted cash and $0.2 million from proceeds from grants.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	The increase in cash was offset by $205.3 million paid for the Clearlink acquisition (net of cash acquired), $78.3 million used for capital expenditures, $19.0 million to repay long-term debt, $11.1 million to repurchase common stock, $4.9 million to repurchase common stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, $1.4 million payment of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and a $0.5 million investment in restricted cash, resulting in a $31.3 million increase in available cash (including the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of $8.4 million).
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S5	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2016 were $130.7 million, compared to $120.5 million in 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S6	The $10.2 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a net increase of $10.2 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities and a $6.2 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization, net (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, partially offset by a $6.2 million decrease in net income.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S7	The $10.2 million increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $26.3 million increase in other liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in taxes payable and a $8.9 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $35.4 million increase in accounts receivable and a $0.3 million increase in other assets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S8	The $26.3 million increase in the change in other liabilities is primarily due to $17.2 million related to the timing of accrued employee compensation and benefits, and $6.7 million related to other accrued expenses and current liabilities principally due to an increase of $4.5 million related to site expansions in 2016 over 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S9	The $35.4 million increase in the change in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of billings and collections in 2016 over 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S10	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $78.3 million for 2016, compared to $49.7 million for 2015, an increase of $28.6 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P37_S11	In 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $55.0 million to $65.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, Enterprise Resource Planning upgrades, facility upgrades, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	On May 12, 2015, we entered into a $440 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender ( KeyBank ).
1010612_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The 2015 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2015 Credit Agreement and had $267.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	On April 1, 2016, we borrowed $216.0 million under our 2015 Credit Agreement in connection with the acquisition of Clearlink.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	See Note 2, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our credit agreements had an average daily utilization of $222.6 million, $70.0 million and $85.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the related interest expense, including the commitment fee and excluding the amortization of deferred loan fees, was $4.0 million, $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 1.8%, 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The 2015 Credit Agreement includes a $200 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2015 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	The 2015 Credit Agreement will mature on May 12, 2020.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P39_S7	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio and due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The 2015 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	We are currently under audit in several tax jurisdictions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	We received assessments for the Canadian 2003-2009 audit.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Requests for Competent Authority Assistance were filed with both the Canadian Revenue Agency and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and we paid mandatory security deposits to Canada as part of this process.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	The total amount of deposits, net of the effects of foreign exchange rate adjustments, were $13.8 million and $13.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain, we believe we are adequately reserved for these audits and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As part of the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, we assumed contingent consideration liabilities related to four separate acquisitions made by Clearlink in 2015 and 2016, prior to the Clearlink acquisition.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The fair value of the contingent consideration related to these previous acquisitions was $2.8 million as of April 1, 2016 and was based on achieving targets primarily tied to revenues for varying periods of time during 2016 and 2017.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration was $1.9 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The estimated future value of the contingent consideration is $2.0 million and is expected to be paid on varying dates through July 2017.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	In July 2015, we completed the acquisition of Qelp B.V. and its subsidiary (together, known as Qelp ) pursuant to the definitive Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated July 2, 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The purchase price of $15.8 million was funded through cash on hand of $9.8 million and contingent consideration of $6.0 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	On September 26, 2016, we entered into an addendum to the Qelp Purchase Agreement with the Sellers to settle the outstanding contingent consideration for EUR 4.0 million ($4.2 million as of December 31, 2016) to be paid on June 30, 2017.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	As of December 31, 2016, we had $266.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 91.4%, or $243.8 million, was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	These funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States, including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental U.S. income tax, net of allowable foreign tax credits.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	We do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	We expect our current domestic cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our domestic anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	However, from time to time, we may borrow funds under our 2015 Credit Agreement as a result of the timing of our working capital needs, including capital expenditures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Additionally, we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	If we should require more cash in the U.S. than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and/or raise capital in the U.S through additional borrowings or debt/equity issuances.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, interest expense and/or dilution of earnings.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	At December 31, 2016, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S5	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P47_S6	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2016, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our purchase obligations, which include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits, which represent amounts due to vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilties, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	(6) Amount represents total outstanding borrowings.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	See Note 18, Borrowings, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	(7) Long-term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 20, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Long-term income tax liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The amount in the table has been reduced by Canadian mandatory security deposits of $13.8 million, which are included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $5.5 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred rent, deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities, represent the expected cash payments for contingent consideration related to the Clearlink and Qelp acquisitions, cash payments due under restructuring accruals for lease obligations and pension obligations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	See Note 2, Acquisitions, Note 3, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, and Note 23, Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Revenues from fulfillment services account for 0.7%, 1.6% and 1.4% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, some of which contain multiple-deliverables.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick-pack-and-ship, warehousing, process management, finished goods assembly and pass-through costs.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	In accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ) (as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ) ( ASU 2009-13 ), we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple-deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	If those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	If those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting, revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight-line basis over the contract period, or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client, as appropriate.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), third-party evidence, and then estimated selling price.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	VSOE is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Third-party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies, service offerings, and customer classifications.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Once we allocate revenue to each deliverable, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2016, our fulfillment contracts with multiple-deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in ASC 605-25 and the revenue was accounted for accordingly.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	Other than these fulfillment contracts, we have no other contracts that contain multiple-deliverables as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $2.9 million as of December 31, 2016, or 0.9% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $30.2 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $0.6 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $29.6 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $8.9 million as of December 31, 2016 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2016, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	A provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $418.6 million as of December 31, 2016, as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	to an incremental U.S. tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits, in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S5	As of December 31, 2016, we had $8.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net increase of $0.4 million from $8.1 million as of December 31, 2015.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S6	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $8.5 million and $8.1 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P72_S7	We anticipate that approximately $0.5 million of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2028.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $3.3 million, $4.0 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, which had a carrying value of $309.3 million as of December 31, 2016, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill, which had a carrying value of $265.4 million as of December 31, 2016, for impairment at least annually, during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	To assess the realizability of goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	We may elect to forgo this option and proceed to the annual two-step goodwill impairment test.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment and it indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value, or we elect to forgo this qualitative assessment, we will proceed to Step 1 testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability-weighted cash flows.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	If Step 1 indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, we will proceed to Step 2 where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as it would in a business combination.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in Step 2.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	In estimating future cash flows, we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization, projected changes in the prices we charge for our services, projected labor costs, as well as contract negotiation status.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	We use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the services are being provided.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	If actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower, causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Contingencies We record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Each quarter, management reviews all litigation and claims on a case-by-case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Other We have made certain other estimates that, while not involving the same degree of judgment, are important to understanding our financial statements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	These estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self-insurance accruals.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	See Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our USD consolidated financial statements.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than USD are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Movements in non-USD currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	We employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in certain earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange ( FX ) rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	We also utilize derivative contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables that are denominated in a foreign currency and to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer engagement center capacity in The Philippines and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	Although the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ) and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), which represent FX exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ), with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints ( HUF ) and Romanian Leis ( RON ).
1010612_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in PHP and CRC, we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2016 with counterparties through December 2017 with notional amounts totaling $96.5 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had net total derivative liabilities associated with these contracts with a fair value of $1.8 million, which will settle within the next 12 months.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $8.2 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We had forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $76.9 million to hedge net investments in our foreign operations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against the risk that the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and economic exposures related to our foreign currency-based investments in these subsidiaries.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $3.2 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2016, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $7.3 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P93_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	We had forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $55.6 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $0.6 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2016, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $1.9 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	We had embedded derivative contracts with notional amounts totaling $13.2 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of $0.6 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2016, for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $2.1 million.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P96_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P97_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P97_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we had $267.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	Based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $2.2 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.

1010612_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	On April 1, 2016, we acquired 100% of the outstanding membership units of Clear Link Holdings, LLC ( Clearlink ).
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	See Note 2, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition and management elected to exclude Clearlink from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Clearlink financial statements constitute 18.9% of total assets and 8.4% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting, except for the change discussed under Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	This report appears on page 44.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting On April 1, 2016, we acquired Clearlink.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	We have excluded Clearlink from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	We have completed certain integration activities and Clearlink has designed internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Management will continue to assess the control environment.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Clear Link Holdings, LLC ( Clearlink ), which was acquired on April 1, 2016 and whose financial statements constitute 18.9% of total assets and 8.4% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Clearlink.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P5_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_17_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	The customer engagement solutions and services industry which includes services such as digital marketing and demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support and customer retention is highly fragmented and significant in size.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	According to Ovum, an industry research firm, the total number of individuals, or agent positions, working in the customer engagement services industry worldwide was estimated at roughly 9.5 million in 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	With approximately 81% of the customer engagement work done by in-house engagement centers, the number of agent positions working for outsourcers, such as SYKES, was estimated at 1.8 million in 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	The outsourced and total agent positions are forecasted by Ovum to grow at a rate of 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively, from 2017 to 2018.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S4	It is estimated that no single outsourcer has more than five percent of the total agent positions worldwide.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S5	Measured in dollar terms, the size of the outsourced portion of the customer engagement solutions and services industry worldwide was estimated at approximately $82 billion in 2017, according to Everest Group, an industry research firm.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S6	Everest Group also estimates that the outsourced portion of the customer engagement solutions and services industry is expected to grow to approximately $85 billion by 2018, a growth rate of 4.0% from 2017 to 2018.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S7	The 2017-2018 growth data measured in dollar terms is extrapolated from Everest Group s estimated compound growth projection of 4.0% for the industry from 2017 to 2020.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S8	We believe that growth for broader outsourced customer engagement solutions and services will be fueled by the trend of Global 2000 companies and medium-sized businesses utilizing outsourcers.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S9	In today s marketplace, companies increasingly are seeking a comprehensive suite of innovative full lifecycle customer engagement management solutions and services that allow them to acquire customers, enhance the end user s experience with their products and services, strengthen and enhance their company brands, maximize the lifetime value of their customers through retention and up-sell and cross-sell, efficiently and effectively deliver human interactions when and where customers value it most, and deploy best-in-class customer management strategies, processes and technologies.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P7_S10	However, a myriad of factors, among them intense global competition, pricing pressures, softness in the global economy and rapid changes in technology, continue to make it difficult for companies to cost-effectively maintain the in-house personnel necessary to handle all of their customer engagement needs.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P10_S5	Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P10_S6	To mitigate the impact of any negative economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P10_S7	We are targeting the following verticals for growth: communications, financial services, technology/consumer, healthcare, transportation and leisure, and other, which includes retail.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Revenues and profitability growth are driven by increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing underutilized seat capacity as deemed necessary.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	With greater operating flexibility resulting from our at-home agent delivery model, we believe we can rationalize underutilized capacity more efficiently and drive capacity utilization rates.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Broadening At-Home Agent and Brick-and-Mortar Global Delivery Footprint.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues and profitability growth, where we deploy both the seat capacity and the at-home agent delivery platform geographically is also important.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint and our at-home agent delivery platform, we believe we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer engagement needs globally as they enter new markets.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	At the end of 2017, our global delivery brick-and-mortar footprint spanned 21 countries while our at-home agent delivery platform was recently launched in EMEA, building on our existing presence in 40 states and ten provinces within the U.S. and Canada, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we intend to continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S5	Digital marketing and demand generation, multilingual customer support, digital self-service support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S6	Additionally, with the proliferation of on-line communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P12_S7	Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities .
1010612_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	The United States, Canada and Germany, for instance, are markets which are served by in-country centers, centers in offshore regions or a combination thereof.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer engagement services.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Continue to Grow Our Business Organically, through Strategic Investments and Partnerships, and through Acquisitions.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have grown our customer engagement solutions and services utilizing a combination of internal organic growth, strategic investments and partnerships, and external acquisitions.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our organic growth, partnership and acquisition strategies are to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	Entry into The Philippines, El Salvador, Romania and Colombia are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	While the Alpine Access, Inc. ( Alpine ), Qelp and Clearlink acquisitions are examples of how we used acquisitions to augment our service offerings and differentiate our delivery model, the ICT Group, Inc. ( ICT ) acquisition is an example of how we used an acquisition to gain overall size and critical mass in key verticals, clients and geographies.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P15_S5	In 2017, we also made a strategic investment of $10.0 million in XSell Technologies, Inc. ( XSell ) for 32.8% of XSell s preferred stock.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	XSell optimizes the sales performance capabilities of a broader base of agents as compared to what has historically been an extremely narrow base by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	As customer contact programs increasingly incorporate up-selling and cross-selling, and measures based on sales conversion, XSell s targeted offering can be leveraged across both chat and voice channels, across traditional customer contact management opportunities, and the Clearlink platform to enhance sales performance and conversion on behalf of our clients.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	We specialize in providing differentiated full lifecycle customer engagement solutions and services to Global 2000 companies and their end customers at key touchpoints a global basis.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	Clients We provide service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	These clients are Global 2000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the communications, financial services, technology/consumer, transportation and leisure, healthcare and other industries.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	Revenue by industry vertical for 2017, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 33% for communications, 27% for financial services, 18% for technology/consumer, 7% for transportation and leisure, 4% for healthcare, 3% for retail and 8% for all other verticals, including government and utilities.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S6	Total revenues by segment from AT T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, were as follows (in thousands): We have multiple distinct contracts with AT T spread across multiple lines of businesses, which expire at varying dates between 2018 and 2019.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S7	We have historically renewed most of these contracts.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P30_S8	However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact our relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients, including AT T, could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under our contracts without penalty.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Total revenues by segment from our next largest client, which was in the financial services vertical in each of the years, were as follows (in thousands): Other than AT T, total revenues by segment of our clients that each individually represents 10% or greater of that segment s revenues in each of the years were as follows (in thousands): Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 46.9%, 49.2% and 48.5% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Competition The industry in which we operate is global, highly fragmented and extremely competitive.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer engagement operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	When it is not the in-house operations of a client or potential client, our public and private direct competition includes 24/7 Customer, Alorica, Arise, Atento, Concentrix, Convergys, Groupe Acticall/Sitel, iQor, LiveOps, StarTek, Sutherland, Teleperformance, TTEC, Transcom and Working Solutions, as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S4	There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer engagement solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S5	Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P33_S6	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer engagement services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer engagement solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	authentication to computer networks and visual work environment setup.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our subsidiary, Alpine, was issued U.S. Patent No. 8,565,413 in 2013, which relates to a system and method for establishment and management of a remote agent engagement center.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	No. 9,100,484 in 2015, which relates to a secure call environment.

1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	Our employees, with the exception of approximately 400 employees in Brazil and various European countries, are not union members and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S4	We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S5	We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S6	This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise to and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S7	Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S8	As such, competition for such personnel is intense.
1010612_18_ITEM1_P39_S9	Additionally, employee turnover in our industry is high.

1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about us, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words such as may, expects, projects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	our ability to continue the growth of our service revenues through additional customer engagement centers; our ability to further penetrate into vertically integrated markets; our ability to expand revenues within the global markets; our ability to continue to establish a competitive advantage through sophisticated technological capabilities, and the following risk factors: Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the demand for some of our clients products and services and, in turn, could cause a decline in the demand for our services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, we may not be able to renew our revolving credit facility at terms that are as favorable as those terms available under our current credit facility.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Also, the group of lenders under our credit facility may not be able to fulfill their funding obligations, which could adversely impact our liquidity.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	For these reasons, among others, if unfavorable economic conditions persist or increase, this could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access debt under comparable terms and conditions.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Our business is dependent on key clients, and the loss of a key client could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a few key clients.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 46.9% of our consolidated revenues in 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short-term notice.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under these contracts without penalty.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Thus, our contracts with our clients do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenues.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Cyber-attacks as well as improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is heavily dependent upon our computer and voice technologies, systems and platforms.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Internal or external attacks on any of those could disrupt the normal operations of our engagement centers and impede our ability to provide critical services to our clients, thereby subjecting us to liability under our contracts.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Additionally, our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our employees, our clients and customers of our clients.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The European Union s ( EU ) General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) will take effect in May 2018 and will require EU member states to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in substantial penalties of up to the greater of 20 million or 4% of global annual revenue of the preceding financial year.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, compliance with the GDPR is resulting in operational costs to implement new procedures corresponding to new legal rights granted under the law.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, local data protection authorities will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR through so-called opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in impairment to our reputation in the marketplace and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our business is subject to substantial competition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The markets for many of our services operate on a commoditized basis and are highly competitive and subject to rapid change.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	While many companies provide outsourced customer engagement services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	There are numerous and varied providers of our services, including firms specializing in engagement center operations, temporary staffing and personnel placement, consulting and integration firms, and niche providers of outsourced customer engagement services, many of whom compete in only certain markets.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our competitors include both companies that possess greater resources and name recognition than we do, as well as small niche providers that have few assets and regionalized (local) name recognition instead of global name recognition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In addition to our competitors, many companies who might utilize our services or the services of one of our competitors may utilize in-house personnel to perform such services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Increased competition, our failure to compete successfully, pricing pressures, loss of market share and loss of clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Many of our large clients purchase outsourced customer engagement services from multiple preferred vendors.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	We have experienced and continue to anticipate significant pricing pressure from these clients in order to remain a preferred vendor.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	These companies also require vendors to be able to provide services in multiple locations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Although we believe we can effectively meet our clients demands, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other outsourced customer engagement services companies on price.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S13	We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of our core services include the standard requirements of service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P6_S14	The concentration of customer engagement centers in certain geographies poses risks to our operations which could adversely affect our financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Although we have engagement centers in many locations throughout the world, we have a concentration of centers in certain geographies outside of the U.S. and Canada, specifically The Philippines and Latin America.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our concentration of operations in those geographies is a result of our ability to access significant numbers of employees with certain language and other skills at costs that are advantageous.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	However, the concentration of business activities in any geographical area creates risks which could harm operations and our financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Certain risks, such as natural disasters, armed conflict and military or civil unrest, political instability and disease transmission, as well as the risk of interruption to our delivery systems, is magnified when the realization of these, or any other risks, would effect a large portion of our business at once, which may result in a disproportionate increase in operating costs.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business is dependent on the demand for outsourcing.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business and growth depend in large part on the industry demand for outsourced customer engagement services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer engagement services rather than perform such services in-house.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	There can be no assurance that this demand will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	A significant change in this demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are subject to various uncertainties relating to future litigation.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We cannot predict whether any material suits, claims, or investigations may arise in the future.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Regardless of the outcome of any future actions, claims, or investigations, we may incur substantial defense costs and such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Also, it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry is subject to rapid technological change which could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changes in client requirements characterize the market for outsourced customer engagement services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Technological advancements in voice recognition software, as well as self-provisioning and self-help software, along with call avoidance technologies, have the potential to adversely impact call volume growth and, therefore, revenues.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service new products, platforms and rapidly changing technology.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These factors will require us to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasingly sophisticated, complex and evolving needs of our clients.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, our ability to capitalize on our acquisitions will depend on our ability to continually enhance software and services and adapt such software to new hardware and operating system requirements.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Any failure by us to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances, new products and enhancements, or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized communications and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients needs.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We anticipate that the requirement to invest in new technologies will continue to grow and that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Significant capital expenditures are expected to be required to keep our technology up-to-date.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Moreover, investments in technology, including future investments in upgrades and enhancements to software, may not necessarily maintain our competitiveness.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions that keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Emergency interruption of customer engagement center operations could affect our business and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our customer engagement centers and our information databases against damage that may be caused by fire, earthquakes, severe weather and other disasters, power failure, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and other emergencies.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Notwithstanding precautions taken to protect us and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there can be no assurance that a fire, natural disaster, human error, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide services to our clients.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively manage our contact center capacity utilization.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers and, as a result, our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects, we may need to open new contact centers.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The opening or expansion of a contact center may result, at least in the short term, in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Additionally, the occasional need to open customer engagement centers fully, or primarily, dedicated to a single client, instead of spreading the work among existing facilities with idle capacity, negatively affects capacity utilization.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We periodically assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our contact centers.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As a result, we may, if deemed necessary, consolidate, close or partially close under-performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As part of our effort to consolidate our facilities, we may seek to sell or sublease a portion of our surplus contact center space, if any, and recover certain costs associated with it.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Failure to sell or sublease such surplus space will negatively impact results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business is significantly dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Accordingly, any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in redundant circuits, although there is no assurance that the redundant circuits would not also suffer disruption.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any inability to obtain telephone or data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short-term rate increases and fluctuations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and find new locations for customer engagement centers in countries with stable wage rates.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business is labor-intensive and therefore wages, employee benefits and employment taxes constitute the largest component of our operating expenses.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to find cost-effective locations in which to operate, both domestically and internationally.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Some of our customer engagement centers are located in countries that have experienced inflation and rising standards of living, which requires us to increase employee wages.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, collective bargaining is being utilized in an increasing number of countries in which we currently, or may in the future, desire to operate.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Collective bargaining may result in material wage and benefit increases.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If wage rates and benefits increase significantly in a country where we maintain customer engagement centers, we may not be able to pass those increased labor costs on to our clients, requiring us to search for other cost effective delivery locations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Additionally, some of our customer engagement centers are located in jurisdictions subject to minimum wage regulations, which may result in increased wages in the future.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to find such cost-effective locations, and even if we do, the costs of closing delivery locations and opening new customer engagement centers can adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our international operations and expansion involve various risks.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets outside the United States.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	At December 31, 2017, our international operations were conducted from 37 customer engagement centers located in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Cyprus, Egypt, Scotland, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Romania, The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India and Australia.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Revenues from these international operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were 36.1%, 36.8%, and 40.5% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We also conduct business from 14 customer engagement centers located in Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, political uncertainties, longer payment cycles, possible greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection, economic instability as well as political and country-specific risks.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, we have been granted tax holidays in The Philippines, Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador that expire at varying dates from 2019 through 2028.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will renew them.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	This could potentially result in adverse tax consequences, the impact of which is not practicable to estimate due to the inherent complexity of estimating critical variables such as long-term future profitability, tax regulations and rates in the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any one or more of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $3.0 million, $3.3 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The 2017 Tax Reform Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We recognized a provisional amount of $32.7 million, which is included as a component of Income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we had cash balances of approximately $335.1 million held in international operations, most of which would not be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In January 2018, we repatriated $167.6 million from our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining outside basis difference inherent in our foreign subsidiaries as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the outside basis difference in investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We conduct business in various foreign currencies and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	We are also subject to certain exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of certain foreign currency exchange exposures.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P24_S9	However, there can be no assurance that we can take actions to mitigate such exposure in the future, and if taken, that such actions will be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A significant change in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the currency of one or more countries where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Additionally, our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risks is not secured by any collateral.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Although each of the counterparty financial institutions with which we place hedging contracts are investment grade rated by the national rating agencies as of the time of the placement, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability of any of our counterparties.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If a counterparty to one or more of our hedge transactions were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor and our exposure at the time would depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The fundamental shift in our industry toward global service delivery markets presents various risks to our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Clients continue to require blended delivery models using a combination of onshore and offshore support.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our offshore delivery locations include The Philippines, the People s Republic of China, India, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, and while we have operated in global delivery markets since 1996, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct and expand such operations, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The success of our offshore operations will be subject to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general and regional economic conditions, prices for our services, competition, changes in regulation and other risks.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, as with all of our operations outside of the United States, we are subject to various additional political, economic and market uncertainties (see Our international operations and expansion involve various risks ).
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Additionally, a change in the political environment in the United States or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of offshore customer engagement solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our global operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We provide services to our clients customers in 21 countries around the world.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Accordingly, we are subject to numerous legal regimes on matters such as taxation, government sanctions, content requirements, licensing, tariffs, government affairs, data privacy and immigration as well as internal and disclosure control obligations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In the U.S., as well as several of the other countries in which we operate, some of our services must comply with various laws and regulations regarding the method and timing of placing outbound telephone calls.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Violations of these various laws and regulations could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations, specifically those relating to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries as well as statutory and regulatory requirements related to derivative transactions, may adversely affect our ability to perform our services at our overseas facilities or could result in additional taxes on such services, or impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges, thereby threatening or limiting our ability or the financial benefit to continue to serve certain markets at offshore locations, or the risks associated therewith.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Corporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	For example, the 2017 Tax Reform Act, adopting broad U.S. corporate income tax reform will, among other things, reduce the U.S. corporate income tax rate, but will impose base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and will have an impact on our consolidated financial results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, the period of enactment.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Failure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including anti-corruption laws and export-import compliance and trade laws, due to our global operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies, their agents, consultants and other business partners from making improper payments to government officials or other persons (i.e., commercial bribery) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other improper advantage.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	They also impose recordkeeping and internal control provisions on companies such as ours.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	We operate and/or conduct business, and any acquisition target may operate and/or conduct business, in some parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in such countries, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Under some circumstances, a parent company may be civilly and criminally liable for bribes paid by a subsidiary.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures have protected us, or will protect us, from unlawful conduct of our employees, agents, consultants and other business partners.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that violations may have occurred, including without limitation violations of anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate and/or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	As a result, any such violations may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Any of these impacts could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Risks Related to Our Employees Our inability to attract and retain experienced personnel may adversely impact our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified technical and consultative professional personnel in a tightening labor market.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We generally experience high turnover of our personnel and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Additionally, demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages, including English, and/or certain technologies may exceed supply, as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting, training, or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our operations are substantially dependent on our senior management.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our success is largely dependent upon the efforts, direction and guidance of our senior management.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Our growth and success also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees and managers and on the ability of our executive officers and key employees to manage our operations successfully.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our executive officers.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	The loss of any of our senior management or key personnel, or the inability to attract, retain or replace key management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Health epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our customer engagement centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves potential risks.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategies, we may be unable to acquire or merge with the company.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Also, a decrease in the price of our common stock could hinder our growth strategy by limiting growth through acquisitions funded with SYKES stock.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	The actual integration of the company may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to fully integrate the acquired operations into our own, or to realize the full amount of anticipated benefits of the integration of the companies.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our acquisition strategy involves other potential risks.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may incur significant cash and non-cash costs in connection with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may incur a number of non-recurring cash and non-cash costs associated with the continued rationalization of assets resulting from acquisitions relating to the closing of facilities and disposition of assets.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We recorded substantial goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the ICT, Alpine, Qelp and Clearlink acquisitions.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill at least annually.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Our organizational documents contain provisions that could impede a change in control.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	The staggered Board of Directors and the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions contained in the Florida Business Corporation Act and in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, including the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of those shares without shareholder approval, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S8	This may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S9	The volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S10	The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations over short and long periods of time.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S11	We believe that market prices of outsourced customer engagement services stocks in general have experienced volatility, which could affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our financial results or performance.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P40_S12	We further believe that various factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, changing market conditions in the outsourced customer engagement services industry, quarterly variations in our financial results, the announcement of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or new product offerings, and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations applicable to public companies operating in the U.S. may have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Because we are a publicly-traded company, we are subject to certain evolving and extensive federal, state and other rules and regulations relating to, among other things, assessment and maintenance of internal controls and corporate governance.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require us to furnish, on an annual basis, a report by our management (included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We must include a disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the annual assessment.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We have in the past discovered, and may potentially in the future discover, areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If at any time we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and/or completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
1010612_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to our periodic or current reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	This facility currently serves as the headquarters for senior management and the financial, information technology and administrative departments.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition to our headquarters and the customer engagement centers ( centers ) used by our Americas and EMEA segments discussed below, we also have offices in several countries around the world which support our Americas and EMEA segments.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we operated one fulfillment location and 79 multi-client centers.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our centers were located in the following countries: We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any physical expansion or any space required due to expiring leases not renewed.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	We operate from time to time in temporary facilities to accommodate growth before new centers are available.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S4	At December 31, 2017, our centers, taken as a whole, were utilized at average capacities of approximately 72% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S5	We had utilization of 71% and 81% in the Americas and EMEA, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM2_P1_S6	Legal Proceedings Information with respect to this item may be found in Note 22, Commitments and Loss Contingency, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Loss Contingency which information is incorporated herein by reference.
1010612_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	indicated, certain information as to the high and low intraday sale prices per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1010612_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of the funds legally available when and if declared by the Board of Directors.
1010612_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1010612_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of February 1, 2018, there were approximately 810 holders of record of our common stock and we estimate there were approximately 11,300 beneficial owners.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	2017 Compared to 2016 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $126.0 million, or 8.6%, in 2017 from 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to higher volumes from existing clients of $51.3 million, new client sales of $51.1 million and Clearlink acquisition revenues of $43.1 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $39.7 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $1.0 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Revenues from our offshore operations represented 40.7% of Americas revenues, compared to 41.2% in 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	The increase in EMEA s revenues was primarily due to higher volumes from existing clients of $24.9 million and new client sales of $2.7 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $3.5 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $2.9 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	On a consolidated basis, we had 52,600 brick-and-mortar seats as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 4,900 seats from 2016.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S6	This increase in seats, net of the Telecommunications Asset acquisition additions, reflects seat additions to support higher projected demand.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S7	The capacity utilization rate on a combined basis was 72% in 2017, compared to 75% in 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S8	This decrease was primarily due to capacity additions owing to higher projected demand and certain operational inefficiencies.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S9	On a geographic segment basis, 45,400 seats were located in the Americas, an increase of 4,200 seats from 2016, and 7,200 seats were located in EMEA, an increase of 700 seats from 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S10	The capacity utilization rate for the Americas in 2017 was 71%, compared to 74% in 2016, down primarily due to the aforementioned factors.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S11	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA in 2017 was 81%, compared to 80% in 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S12	We expect to rationalize excess capacity during 2018.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P13_S13	We strive to attain a capacity utilization of 85% at each of our locations.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in Americas direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.5% and higher customer-acquisition advertising costs of 0.5% in connection with Clearlink s operations, partially offset by lower communication costs of 0.2%.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	EMEA s direct salaries and related costs, as a percentage of revenues, remained consistent and were primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 0.4% and higher other costs of 0.4%, offset by lower fulfillment materials costs of 0.8%.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The decrease in Americas general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to a reduction in technology costs of 0.2% allocated from corporate and lower technology equipment and maintenance costs of 0.2%, partially offset by higher compensation costs of 0.2% and higher other costs of 0.1%.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	The increase in EMEA s general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributable to a gain on settlement of Qelp s contingent consideration in the prior period of 1.1%, higher compensation costs of 0.6% and higher recruiting costs of 0.4%, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs of 0.3% and lower other costs of 0.3%.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	The decrease of $1.9 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to lower merger and integration costs of $3.8 million, lower compensation costs of $2.8 million and lower other costs of $0.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in technology costs of $2.5 million allocated to the Americas, higher legal and professional fees of $0.9 million, higher severance costs of $0.8 million and higher charitable contributions of $0.6 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to new depreciable fixed assets placed into service supporting site expansions and infrastructure upgrades as well as the addition of depreciable fixed assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, partially offset by certain fully depreciated fixed assets.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, partially offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Interest income remained consistent with the prior year.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase in interest (expense) was primarily due to $216.0 million in borrowings used to acquire Clearlink in April 2016 as well as an increase in weighted average interest rates on outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in the interest accretion on contingent consideration.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The increase in other miscellaneous income (expense) was primarily due to the net investment income (losses) related to the investments held in rabbi trust.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	See Note 11, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to a $32.7 million one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed non-U.S. earnings resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform Act.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by several other factors including the recognition of $2.0 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of penalties and interest, $1.2 million arising from the effective settlement of the Canadian Revenue Agency audit and $0.8 million arising from other favorable audit settlements and statute of limitation expirations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Additionally, we recognized a $0.8 million benefit related to the increase in anticipated tax credits and reductions in estimated non-deferred foreign income, as well as a $0.3 million benefit for the release of a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	We also recognized a $0.9 million benefit resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The effective tax rate was also affected by shifts in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Several additional factors, none of which are individually material, also impacted the rate.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Compared to 2015 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased $173.7 million, or 13.5%, in 2016 from 2015.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	The increase in Americas revenues was primarily due to Clearlink acquisition revenues of $123.3 million, higher volumes from existing clients of $92.9 million and new client sales of $8.5 million, partially offset by end-of-life client programs of $36.6 million and the negative foreign currency impact of $12.7 million.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P20_S7	The capacity utilization rate for EMEA in 2016 was 80%, compared to 85% in 2015, down primarily due to lower demand in certain existing clients, certain end-of-life client programs and the rationalization of seats in a highly utilized center due to a planned program expiration.

1010612_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	The increase of $9.1 million in Other general and administrative expenses, which includes corporate and other costs, was primarily attributable to higher merger and integration costs of $4.0 million, higher compensation costs of $2.6 million, a reduction in technology costs of $1.9 million allocated to the Americas, higher software maintenance costs of $0.5 million and higher consulting costs of $0.3 million, partially offset by lower other costs of $0.2 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The increase in depreciation was primarily due to new depreciable fixed assets placed into service supporting site expansions as well as the addition of depreciable fixed assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, partially offset by certain fully depreciated fixed assets.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The increase in amortization was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition and the July 2015 Qelp acquisition, partially offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Interest income remained consistent with the prior year.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increase in interest (expense) was primarily due to $216.0 million in borrowings used to acquire Clearlink in April 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	The (loss) on liquidation of foreign subsidiaries in 2015 was due to the substantial liquidation of operations in a foreign entity.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	The increase in other miscellaneous income (expense) was primarily due to the net investment income (losses) related to the investments held in rabbi trust.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	See Note 11, Investments Held in Rabbi Trust, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Income Taxes The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to the recognition in the prior period of a $2.2 million previously unrecognized tax benefit, inclusive of penalties and interest, arising from statute of limitations expirations and a $1.3 million reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not the assets will be realized due to the current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate was also affected by several additional factors, including increases in state taxation along with shifts in earnings among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, none of which are individually material.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The following information presents our unaudited quarterly operating results for 2017 and 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The data has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	(4) The quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a $0.2 million (gain) on the sale of fixed assets, land and building located in Morganfield, Kentucky.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	See Note 12, Property and Equipment, for further information.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	(5) Impairment, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment in the Americas, was related to an effort to streamline excess capacity subsequent to the Telecommunications Asset acquisition.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	See Note 4, Fair Value, for further information.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	(8) Net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented and, therefore, may not sum to the total for the year.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Business Outlook For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we anticipate the following financial results:
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our business outlook reflects the continuation of healthy demand trends.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	This demand trend spans various verticals, including financial services, technology, retail and travel.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our implied operating margin, however, reflects the impact of labor tightness and wage inflation cross-currents primarily in the U.S. that have swiftly broadened in span and scope given the changes in the economic backdrop in the U.S. spurred in party by the passage of 2017 Tax Reform Act.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	We continue to address the challenges in the U.S. through various measures, including shifting some existing and new client demand to either better positioned facilities, to at-home agent or to other international geographies, coupled with rationalizing excess capacity as well as negotiating price increases where feasible.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	Our first quarter 2018 outlook reflects the above actions and we expect operational improvements from these actions as the year progresses.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S5	Our revenues and earnings per share assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2018 are based on foreign exchange rates as of February 2018.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P32_S6	Therefore, the continued volatility in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of the markets we serve could have a further impact, positive or negative, on revenues and earnings per share relative to the business outlook for the first quarter and full-year as discussed above.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We anticipate total other interest income (expense), net of approximately $(0.7) million for the first quarter and $(3.2) million for the full year 2018.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The reduction in interest expense in 2018 versus 2017 largely reflects the $175.0 million repayment of long-term debt outstanding under 2015 Credit Agreement in January 2018, partially offset by expectations of planned interest rates increases on the remaining borrowings and increased fees related to the undrawn portion of the credit facility.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The amounts in the other interest income (expense), net, however, exclude the potential impact of any future foreign exchange gains or losses.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	We expect a reduction in our full-year 2018 effective tax rate compared to 2017 due largely to the 2017 Tax Reform Act, which reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Not included in this guidance is the impact of any future acquisitions, share repurchase activities or a potential sale of previously exited customer engagement centers.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer engagement services, invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund acquisitions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	In future periods, we intend similar uses of these funds.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 18, 2011, the Board authorized us to purchase up to 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock (the 2011 Share Repurchase Program ).
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	On March 16, 2016, the Board authorized an increase of 5.0 million shares to the 2011 Share Repurchase Program, for a total of 10.0 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	A total of 5.3 million shares have been repurchased under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program since inception.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	The shares are purchased, from time to time, through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions, and the purchases are based on factors, including but not limited to, the stock price, management discretion and general market conditions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	The 2011 Share Repurchase Program has no expiration date.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	During 2017, cash increased $134.8 million from operating activities, $8.0 million from proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and $0.2 million of proceeds from grants, which was partially offset by $63.3 million used for capital expenditures, $9.1 million of cash paid for acquisitions, a $5.8 million payment of contingent consideration, a $5.1 million settlement of the net investment hedge, a $5.0 million investment in equity method investees, a $4.8 million purchase of intangible assets and $3.9 million to repurchase common stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards, resulting in a $77.1 million increase in available cash (including the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of $31.1 million).
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for 2017 were $134.8 million, compared to $132.8 million in 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The $2.0 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a net increase of $18.5 million in cash flows from assets and liabilities and a $13.6 million increase in non-cash reconciling items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment losses and unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, partially offset by a $30.1 million decrease in net income.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	The $18.5 million increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a $22.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $6.1 million increase in other liabilities and a $5.7 million decrease in other assets, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in deferred revenue and a $3.9 million increase in taxes receivable, net.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	The $22.8 million decrease in the change in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of billings and collections in 2017 over 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Capital expenditures, which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities, were $63.3 million for 2017, compared to $78.3 million for 2016, a decrease of $15.0 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	In 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $50.0 million to $55.0 million, primarily for new seat additions, facility upgrades, maintenance and systems infrastructure.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	On May 12, 2015, we entered into a $440 million revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Agreement ) with a group of lenders and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender ( KeyBank ).
1010612_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The 2015 Credit Agreement is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the 2015 Credit Agreement and had $275.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	On April 1, 2016, we borrowed $216.0 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement in connection with the acquisition of Clearlink.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	See Note 2, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In January 2018, we repaid $175.0 million of long-term debt outstanding under our 2015 Credit Agreement, primarily using funds we repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a remaining outstanding debt balance of $100.0 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our 2018 interest expense will vary based on our usage of the facility and market interest rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The 2015 Credit Agreement includes a $200 million alternate-currency sub-facility, a $10 million swingline sub-facility and a $35 million letter of credit sub-facility, and may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases, working capital support and letters of credit, subject to certain limitations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the 2015 Credit Agreement, if necessary.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us, even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	The 2015 Credit Agreement will mature on May 12, 2020.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	Our credit agreements had an average daily utilization of $268.8 million, $222.6 million and $70.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the related interest expense, including the commitment fee and excluding the amortization of deferred loan fees, was $6.7 million, $4.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which represented weighted average interest rates of 2.5%, 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	In addition, we are required to pay certain customary fees, including a commitment fee determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio and due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The 2015 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the non-voting and 65% of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	We received assessments for the Canadian 2003-2009 audit.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Requests for Competent Authority Assistance were filed with both the Canadian Revenue Agency and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and we paid mandatory security deposits to Canada as part of this process.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The total amount of deposits was $13.8 million as of December 31, 2016 (none at December 31, 2017) and was included in Deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	As of June 30, 2017, we determined that all material aspects of the Canadian audit were effectively settled pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	As a result, we recognized an income tax benefit of $1.2 million, net of the U.S. tax impact, and the deposits were netted against the anticipated liability.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	With the effective settlement of the Canadian audit, we have no significant tax jurisdictions under audit; however, we are currently under audit in several tax jurisdictions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	We believe we are adequately reserved for the remaining audits and their resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	On April 24, 2017, we entered into a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement to purchase certain assets of a Global 2000 telecommunications services provider.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The aggregate purchase price of $7.5 million was paid on May 31, 2017, using cash on hand.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	As part of the April 2016 Clearlink acquisition, we assumed contingent consideration liabilities related to four separate acquisitions made by Clearlink in 2015 and 2016, prior to the Clearlink acquisition.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The fair value of the contingent consideration related to these previous acquisitions was $2.8 million as of April 1, 2016 and was based on achieving targets primarily tied to revenues for varying periods of time during 2016 and 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	As of October 31, 2017, no contingent consideration liability remained.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	As part of the July 2015 Qelp acquisition, we recorded contingent consideration of $6.0 million as part of the purchase price.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	On September 26, 2016, we entered into an addendum to the Qelp purchase agreement with the sellers to settle the outstanding contingent consideration for EUR 4.0 million to be paid by June 30, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S5	We paid $4.4 million in May 2017 to settle the outstanding contingent consideration obligation.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we had $343.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 97.5%, or $335.1 million, was held in international operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P46_S7	Most of these funds will not be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	There are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The 2017 Tax Reform Act provides for a one-time transition tax based on our undistributed foreign earnings on which we previously had deferred U.S. income taxes.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We recorded a $28.3 million provisional liability, which is net of $5.0 million of available tax credits, for our one-time transition tax, of which $3.8 million and $24.5 million were included in Income taxes payable and Long-term income tax liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	This transition tax liability will be paid over the next eight years.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining outside basis difference inherent in these foreign subsidiaries as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	We expect our current cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital needs, including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	However, from time to time, we may borrow funds under our 2015 Credit Agreement as a result of the timing of our working capital needs, including capital expenditures.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	Our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	At December 31, 2017, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	These include, but are not limited to: (i) indemnities to clients, vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving breach of contract, the accuracy of representations and warranties, or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability, and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	We have not recorded any liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2017, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
1010612_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments under our purchase obligations, which include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	(3) Accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits, which represent amounts due to vendors and employees payable within one year.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	(4) Income taxes payable, which represents amounts due to taxing authorities payable within one year.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	(5) Other accrued expenses and current liabilities, which exclude deferred grants, include amounts primarily related to restructuring costs, legal and professional fees, telephone charges, rent, derivative contracts and other accruals.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	(6) Amount represents total outstanding borrowings.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	See Note 18, Borrowings, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	(7) Long-term income tax liabilities include amounts owed over the next eight years related to our deemed repatriation under the 2017 Tax Reform Act as well as uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in Note 20, Income Taxes, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	We cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of $2.6 million of the long-term liabilities with the taxing authority; therefore, amounts have been excluded from payments due by period.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	(8) Other long-term liabilities, which exclude deferred income taxes and other non-cash long-term liabilities and pension obligations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	See Note 23, Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Unless we need to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Recognition of Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition .
1010612_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed, which is based on either a per minute, per call, per transaction or per time and material basis, under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	Product sales, accounted for within our fulfillment services, are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, $3.0 million as of December 31, 2017, or 0.9% of trade account receivables, for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information, a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	It is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in a reduced ability to make payments.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Taxes We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes, but is not limited to, our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we determined that a total valuation allowance of $32.4 million was necessary to reduce U.S. deferred tax assets by $0.9 million and foreign deferred tax assets by $31.5 million, where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	The recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2017 is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2017, based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions, we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Reform Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a participation exemption regime, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the 2017 Tax Reform Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $32.7 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	The $32.7 million estimate includes the provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings of $32.7 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $531.8 million and $1.0 million of foreign withholding taxes on certain anticipated distributions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S4	The provisional tax expense was partially offset by a provisional benefit of $1.0 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P69_S5	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	practicable due to the inherent complexity of the multi-national tax environment in which we operate.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of identification, but no later than one year from the enactment date.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P71_S4	We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Second, the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S3	This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S4	Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, a net decrease of $7.2 million from $8.5 million as of December 31, 2016.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S6	The decrease was primarily due to the effective settlement of the Canadian Revenue Agency audit.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S7	Had we recognized these tax benefits, approximately $1.3 million and $8.5 million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P73_S8	We anticipate that approximately $0.4 million of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates different from the U.S. tax rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	In addition, we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2028.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	If we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions, our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	In some cases, the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	In other cases, we expect to renew these tax holidays, but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The tax holidays decreased the provision for income taxes by $3.0 million, $3.3 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors, including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changing legislation, regulations, and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as new requirements, pronouncements and rulings of certain tax, regulatory and accounting organizations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets, which had a carrying value of $301.1 million as of December 31, 2017, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	An asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and, therefore, might require an impairment charge in the future.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill, which had a carrying value of $269.3 million as of December 31, 2017, for impairment at least annually on July 31st of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	To assess the realizability of goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	We may elect to forgo this option and proceed to the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment and it indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value, or we elect to forgo this qualitative assessment, we will proceed to the quantitative goodwill impairment test where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability-weighted cash flows.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	If the quantitative goodwill impairment test indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	The most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	In estimating future cash flows, we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization, projected changes in the prices we charge for our services, projected labor costs, as well as contract negotiation status.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	We use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the services are being provided.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	If actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower, causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Contingencies We record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Each quarter, management reviews all litigation and claims on a case-by-case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Other We have made certain other estimates that, while not involving the same degree of judgment, are important to understanding our financial statements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	These estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self-insurance accruals.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	See Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar ( USD ) are translated into our consolidated financial statements.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	As exchange rates vary, those results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	The cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than USD are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position, as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S. based competitors.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We also utilize derivative contracts to hedge intercompany loan receivables and payables that are denominated in a foreign currency and to hedge net investments in foreign operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	We serve a number of U.S.-based clients using customer engagement center capacity in The Philippines and Costa Rica, which are within our Americas segment.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Although a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in Philippine Pesos ( PHP ) and Costa Rican Colones ( CRC ), the contracts with these clients are priced in USDs, which represent FX exposures.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	Additionally, our EMEA segment services clients in Hungary and Romania with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in Hungarian Forints ( HUF ) and Romanian Leis ( RON ), where the contracts are priced in Euros ( EUR ).
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S4	In order to hedge a portion of our anticipated revenues denominated in USD and EUR, we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of December 31, 2017 with counterparties through March 2019 with notional amounts totaling $168.5 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of $3.3 million, which will settle within the next 15 months.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S6	If the USD was to weaken against the PHP and CRC and the EUR was to weaken against the HUF and RON by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a loss of approximately $15.2 million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P91_S7	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	We had forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $9.3 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against FX volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables, and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $0.2 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2017 for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $1.9 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P92_S4	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	We had embedded derivative contracts with notional amounts totaling $13.5 million that are not designated as hedges.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of $0.5 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2017 for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $2.2 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	However, this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	We periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P94_S4	For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	We pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we had $275.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	Based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-point increase in the weighted average interest rate, which generally equals the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, would have had a $2.7 million impact on our results of operations.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	In January 2018, we repaid $175.0 million of long-term debt outstanding under our 2015 Credit Agreement, resulting in a remaining outstanding debt balance of $100.0 million.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P95_S5	Our 2018 interest expense will vary based on our usage of the facility and market interest rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	We have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
1010612_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are located beginning on page 51 and page 34 of this report, respectively.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S6	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This report appears on page 44.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated Tampa, Florida Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and schedule.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P2_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1010612_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
