945983_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Programmer s segment sells technical software, hardware, and services for microcomputers, servers, and networks to individual programmers, corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions primarily in the United States and Canada.
945983_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	For each of our segments, revenues from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	In the Lifeboat segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	In the Programmers segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software products.
945983_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical su pport.
945983_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals a wide selection of products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	The market for developer and infrastructure software products is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	While Microsoft and other vendors currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not, however, attempted to completely bypass the reseller channel.
945983_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	There can be no assurances that software developers and publishers will continue using resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, result of operations and financial condition.
945983_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, including CA Technologies Inc., Quest Software, Inc., GFI Software, Intel Corporation, Infragistics, TechSmith Corporation, Flexera Corp., Acronis, Solarwinds, and Veeam Corporation.
945983_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 4%, 7% and 4%, of our overall revenue in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
945983_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2010.
945983_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2010, CDW Corporation accounted for 15.8% of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2010, 12.8% of total net accounts receivable.

945983_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	The Company had no major customers that accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2008.
945983_11_ITEM1_P16_S4	Our top five customers accounted for 44%, 36%, and 31% of consolidated net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
945983_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	This allows for minimum backlog in the business.
945983_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Sales in Canada represented 7% of our consolidated revenues in 2010, as compared to 8% in 2009, and 11% in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Sales in Canada increased in absolute dollars in 2010 as compared to 2009, but decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to overall increased sales volume in other regions.
945983_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Company s business and results of operations may be ad versely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2010, Quest was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10%.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010 Quest accounted for 11.2% of our total purchases.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2009, Quest was similarly the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10%, representing 10.2% of our total purchases.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2008, VMware and Quest accounted for 23.3% and 13%, respectively, of our total purchases.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S5	VMware terminated its distributor agreement with Lifeboat Distribution, Inc. in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S6	As a result, our Lifeboat segment ceased distributing VMware products as of October 1, 2008, the distribution of which had accounted for $29.2 million, or 17% of our 2008 revenue.
945983_11_ITEM1_P22_S7	Although we succ essfully replaced VMware, the loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	In 2010, the Company purchased approximately 90% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 85% in 2009, and 90% in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Company operates distribution facilities in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and Mississauga, Canada.
945983_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Company conducts its business under the various trademarks and service marks of Programmer s Paradise, the Island Man cartoon character logo, and Lifeboat.
945983_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.
945983_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries had 102 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee.

945983_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Reference to the uniform resource locators or URLs contained in this section is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sa les, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspon dingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Lingering Effects of the Recent Economic Downturn May Reduce our Revenues and Profits.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The lingering ongoing effects of the general economic downturn continues to cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables f rom those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software lic ensing agreements sold by us.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically are at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical personnel.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation s and financial condition.

945983_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	As of January 1, 2006 we organized our Company into two reportable operating segments the Programmer s Paradise segment, which sells technical software, hardware and services directly to end-users (such as individual programmers, corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions) and the Lifeboat segment, which distributes technical software to corporate resellers, VARs, consultants and systems integrators.
945983_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We offer a wide variety of technical and general business application software from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers.
945983_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We market these products through our catalogs, direct mail programs, advertisements in trade magazines, as well as through Internet and e-mail promotions.

945983_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
945983_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	We strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report, particularly the risks described under Item 1A. Risk Factors above.
945983_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Such risks include, but are not limited to, the continued acceptance of the Company s distribution channel by vendors and customers, the timely availability and acceptance of new products, contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs, as well as factors that affect the software industry generally.
945983_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
945983_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
945983_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.
945983_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
945983_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The statements concerning future sales, future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward looking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products, product mix, pricing pressures, market conditions and other factors, which could result in a fluctuation of sales below recent experience.
945983_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods.
945983_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher postage and operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We reported a net income of $4.4 million for the year 2010 as compared to a net income of $2.9 million in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase resulted primarily resulted from the increase in revenue offset in part by competitive pricing pressure.
945983_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our income before income taxes increased by $2.4 million to $7.2 million compared to $4.8 million in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Income from operations amounted to $6.8 million in 2010 as compared to $4.3 million in 2009, representing an increase of $2.5 million as compared to 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross profit increased by $4.4 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased by $1.9 million in 2010 as compared to 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general; shifts in demand for software products; pricing: industry shipments of new software products or upgrades; the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings; fluctuations in response rates; fluctuations in postage, paper, shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns; adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping; shifts in the timing of holidays; and changes in the Company s product offerings.
945983_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts.
945983_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	If revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.
945983_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
945983_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:
945983_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Net sales for 2010 increased 41% or $60.3 million to $206.7 million compared to $146.4 million in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Total sales for our Lifeboat segment in 2010 were $149.2 million compared to $98.1 million in 2009, representing a 52% increase.
945983_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Total sales for the Programmer s Paradise segment in 2010 amounted to $57.6 million, compared to $48.3 million in 2009, representing a 19% increase.
945983_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in net sales for our Lifeboat segment was mainly a result of our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business, the addition of several key product lines, and the strengthening of our account penetration.
945983_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In the Programmer s Paradise segment, sales for 2010 increased by $9.3 million, compared with 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	This increase was primarily due to the fact that we had larger transactions in 2010 compared to 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross Profit for 2010 was $20.0 million compared to $15.6 million in 2009, a 28% increase.
945983_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Total gross profit for our Programmer s Paradise segment was $6.3 million compared to $5.7 million in 2009, representing a 12% increase.
945983_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Total gross profit for our Lifeboat segment was $13.7 million compared to $9.9 million in 2009, representing a 38% increase.
945983_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2010 was 9.7% compared to 10.7% in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Gross profit margin percentage for our Programmer s Paradise segment in 2010 was 11.0% compared to 11.7% in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Gross profit margin percentage for our Lifeboat segment in 2010 was 9.2% compared to 10.1% in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in gross profit dollars and the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by the aggressive sales growth within our Lifeboat segment, offset in part, by competitive pricing pressure in both segments, and, in part, by our having won several large bids based on aggressive pricing, which we plan to continue to do.
945983_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Total SG A expenses for 2010 were $13.2 million compared to $11.3 million in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses for 2010 and 2009 were 6.4% and 7.7%, respectively.
945983_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	This dollar increase was primarily the result of higher employee and employee-related costs (salaries, commissions, bonus accruals and benefits and travel and entertainment) of $1.8 million.
945983_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2010 were $6.9 million compared to $5.5 million in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Total direct selling costs for our Programmer s Paradise segment for 2010 were $2.9 million compared to $2.7 million in the same period in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Total direct selling costs for our Lifeboat segment for 2010 were $3.9 million compared to $2.9 million in the same period in 2009, mainly due to increased employee related costs to manage and reward our growth in this segment.
945983_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring our sales and remaining general and administrative expenses closely.
945983_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.8 million which consists of a provision of $1.8 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.5 million provision for state and local taxes, a $0.2 million provision for Canadian taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.3 million.
945983_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $0.9 million.
945983_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a benefit of $78 thousand related to the reversal of the Company s liability related to uncertain tax positions.
945983_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million which consists of a provision of $1.1 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.4 million provision for state and local taxes, a $0.2 million provision for Canadian taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.3 million.
945983_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $1.2 million.
945983_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net sales for 2009 decreased 16% or $27.6 million to $146.4 million compared to $174.0 million in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Total sales for our Lifeboat segment were $98.1 million compared to $117.1 million in 2008, representing a 16% decrease.
945983_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Total sales for the Programmer s Paradise segment in 2009 amounted to $48.3 million, compared to $56.9 million in 2008, representing a 15% decrease.
945983_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The decline in sales for our Lifeboat segment was primarily due to a decrease in VMware sales.
945983_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	VMware terminated its distributor agreement with Lifeboat Distribution, Inc. in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	As a result, our Lifeboat segment ceased distributing VMware products as of October 1, 2008, the distribution of which had accounted for $29.2 million, or 17% of our 2008 revenue and $57.2 million, or 32% of our 2007 revenue.
945983_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Excluding the effect of VMware, Lifeboat segment sales during 2009 showed strong growth, increasing by $10.1 million from 2008, or 11.5%.
945983_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In the Programmer s Paradise segment, sales for 2009 decreased by $8.6 million, compared with the year-earlier period.
945983_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	This decline was primarily due to a shift in mix of order size: We had fewer large transactions, the decrease in revenue from which was not completely offset by increased sales of our smaller specialized software lines in 2009.
945983_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross Profit for 2009 was $15.6 million compared to $16.8 million in 2008, a 7% decrease.
945983_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total gross profit for our Programmer s Paradise segment was $5.7 million compared to $6.5 million in 2008, representing a 13% decrease.
945983_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Total gross profit for our Lifeboat segment was $9.9 million compared to $10.3 million in 2008, representing a 3% decrease.
945983_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2009 was 10.7% compared to 9.7% in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Gross profit margin percentage for our Programmer s Paradise segment in 2009 was 11.7% compared to 11.4% in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Gross profit margin percentage for our Lifeboat segment in 2009 was 10.1% compared to 8.8% in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily caused by the decline in VMware sales which carried lower margins than our other lines.
945983_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Lifeboat segment represented 67% of total sales in 2009 and 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Gross profit margin percentage for our Lifeboat segment was 10.1% compared to 11.7% for our Programmer s Paradise segment.
945983_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Total SG A expenses for 2009 were $11.3 million compared to $12.2 million in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses for 2009 and 2008 were 7.7% and 7.0%, respectively.
945983_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	This dollar decrease was the result of lower employee and employee related costs of $0.6 million (including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, commissions, and travel and entertainment), and lower occupancy related costs of $0.3 million primarily because we did not take any additional reserve related to the Long Island lease and lower depreciation compared to 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2009 were $5.5 million compared to $5.8 million in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total direct selling costs for our Programmer s Paradise segment for 2009 were $2.6 million compared to $2.9 million in the same period in 2008.
945983_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Total direct selling costs for our Lifeboat segment were $2.9 million in each of 2009 and 2008.

945983_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Reference to these uniform resource locators or URLs is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company operates through two segments, Lifeboat Distribution ( Lifeboat ) and the TechXtend ( TechXtend ) segment (formerly the Programmer s Paradise segment).
945983_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Lifeboat segment distributes technical software through a worldwide network of corporate and value-added resellers, consultants, and systems integrators.
945983_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The TechXtend segment sells technical software, hardware, and services for microcomputers, servers, and networks to individual programmers, corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions primarily in the United States and Canada.
945983_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	For each of our segments, revenues from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	In the Lifeboat segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software products.
945983_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals a wide selection of products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	The market for developer and infrastructure software products is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	While Microsoft and other vendors currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not, however, attempted to completely bypass the reseller channel.
945983_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	There can be no assurances, that software developers and publishers will continue using resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, including CA Technologies Inc., Quest Software, Inc., Intel Corporation, Vmware, TechSmith Corporation, Flexera Corp., Acronis, Solarwinds, Astaro, and Veeam Corporation.
945983_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 4%, 4% and 7%, of our overall revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
945983_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company had three customers that accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2011.

945983_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	This allows for minimum backlog in the business.
945983_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Sales in Canada represented 7% of our consolidated revenues in 2011, as compared to 7% in 2010, and 8% in 2009.
945983_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_12_ITEM1_P22_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, Veeam software and Quest were the only individual vendors from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases.
945983_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, Veeam and Quest accounted for 12.6% and 11.2%, respectively, of our total purchases.

945983_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2011, the Company purchased approximately 90% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 90% in 2010, and 85% in 2009.
945983_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.

945983_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real -time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company conducts its business under the various trademarks and service marks of Programmer s Paradise, the Island Man cartoon character logo, TechXtend, and Lifeboat.

945983_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Lingering Effects of the Recent Economic Downturn May Reduce our Revenues and Profits.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical personnel.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

945983_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we are delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market, we do not qualify for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

945983_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
945983_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report, particularly the risks described under Item 1A. Risk Factors above.
945983_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Such risks include, but are not limited to, the continued acceptance of the Company s distribution channel by vendors and customers, the timely availability and acceptance of new products, contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs, as well as factors that affect the software industry generally.
945983_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
945983_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.

945983_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods.
945983_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	postage and operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We reported a net income of $5.5 million for the year 2011 as compared to a net income of $4.4 million in 2010.
945983_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase resulted primarily from the increase in revenue, offset in part by competitive pricing pressure which lowered gross profit margin percentage and increased selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses.
945983_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our income before income taxes increased by $1.8 million to $9.0 million compared to $7.2 million in 2010.
945983_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income from operations amounted to $8.6 million in 2011 as compared to $6.8 million in 2010, representing an increase of $1.8 million as compared to 2010.

945983_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general; shifts in demand for software products; pricing; industry shipments of new software products or upgrades; the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings; fluctuations in response rates; fluctuations in merchandise returns; adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping; shifts in the timing of holidays; and changes in the Company s product offerings.

945983_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	If revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.

945983_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:

945983_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.
945983_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Lifeboat Distribution segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators primarily in the United States and Canada.
945983_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The TechXtend segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the United States and Canada.
945983_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software products.
945983_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_13_ITEM1_P7_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals a wide selection of products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The market for developer and infrastructure software products is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	While Microsoft and other vendors currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not, however, attempted to completely bypass the reseller channel.
945983_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	There can be no assurances, that software developers and publishers will continue using resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Acronis, CA Technologies, DataCore, Datawatch, Dell, Flexera Software, GFI, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Microsoft, Mindjet, Quest Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Veeam, Vision Solutions and VMware.
945983_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 4% of our overall net sales in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.
945983_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company had three customers that accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2012.
945983_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, Software House International, CDW Corporation, and Insight accounted for 13.4%, 12.4% and 11.1%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2012, 12.0%, 9.6%, and 8.3%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable.
945983_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, CDW Corporation, Insight and Software House International accounted for 14.0%, 11.0% and 10.5%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.

945983_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	This allows for minimum backlog in the business.
945983_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Sales in Canada represented 7% of our consolidated revenues in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.
945983_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, Dell/Quest Software was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 13.4% of our total purchases.
945983_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, Veeam and Quest accounted for 12.6% and 11.2%, respectively, of our total purchases.
945983_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010, Quest was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and represented 11.2% of our total purchases.
945983_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2012, the Company purchased approximately 91% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 90% in 2011 and 2010.
945983_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Company operates distribution facilities in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and Mississauga, Canada.
945983_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Company conducts its business under the various trademarks and service marks of Programmer s Paradise, the Island Man cartoon character logo, TechXtend, and Lifeboat Distribution.

945983_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The ongoing effects of the general economic downturn continues to cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We Depend on Having Creditworthy Customers to Avoid an Adverse Impact to Our Operating Results and Financial Condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Furthermore, if any of our customers to whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of financing revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical personnel.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Risks Related to Our Common Stock .
945983_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The exercise of outstanding options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded.
945983_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.

945983_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
945983_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.

945983_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods.
945983_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher postage and operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of the Company s Common Stock.

945983_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our income before income taxes increased by $0.1 million to $9.1 million in 2012 compared to $9.0 million in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	We reported a net income of $5.5 million for each of 2012 and 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings, fluctuations in response rates, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings.

945983_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.
945983_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
945983_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:
945983_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net sales for 2012 increased 19%, or $46.9 million to $297.1 million in 2012 compared to $250.2 million in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Total sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2012 were $217.3 million compared to $192.7 million in 2011, representing a 13% increase.
945983_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Total sales for the TechXtend segment in 2012 amounted to $79.7 million, compared to $57.4 million in 2011, representing a 39% increase.
945983_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in net sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the strengthening of our account penetration, our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business and the addition of several key product lines.
945983_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The 39% increase in sales in the TechXtend division was primarily due to an increase in larger extended payment term transactions, solution focus selling and higher average order sizes in 2012.
945983_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Gross Profit for 2012 was $23.9 million compared to $23.2 million in 2011, a 3% increase.
945983_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Total gross profit for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was $15.8 million compared to $16.8 million in 2011, representing a 6% decrease.
945983_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	was due to lower vendor rebate attainment and competitive pricing pressure within this segment.
945983_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Total gross profit for our TechXtend segment was $8.1 million compared to $6.4 million in 2011, representing a 25% increase.
945983_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	The increase in gross profit for the TechXtend segment was the result of increased sales volume offset in part by a lower gross margin in 2012 as compared to 2011 and lower vendor rebates.
945983_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Vendor rebates and discounts for 2012 amounted to $1.8 million compared to $2.9 million for 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors.
945983_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Vendors have been periodically substantially increasing their target revenues for rebate eligibility.
945983_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Therefore, despite our increasing revenue, vendor rebates have declined.
945983_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for 2012 was 8.0% compared to 9.3% in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Gross profit margin for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2012 was 7.3% compared to 8.7% in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Gross profit margin for our TechXtend segment in 2012 was 10.1% compared to 11.2% in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The increase in gross profit dollars and the decrease in gross profit margins were primarily caused by the sales growth within our Lifeboat Distribution and TechXtend segments, offset in part, by continued pressure on discounts and rebates earned and competitive pricing pressure in both segments, and, in part, by our having won several large bids, including transactions on extended payment terms, based on aggressive pricing which we plan to continue.
945983_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company monitors gross profits and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Price competition in our market intensified further in 2012, with competitors lowering their prices significantly and the Company responding immediately.
945983_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Although our sales volume increased substantially as a result, gross margins, as well as the rebates and discounts that are material elements of the Company s overall profitability, were negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2012.
945983_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	We anticipate that margins, as well as discounts and rebates, will continue to be affected by this current trend.
945983_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Total selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses for 2012 were $15.4 million compared to $14.6 million in 2011, representing an increase of $0.8 million.
945983_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	This increase is primarily the result of an increase in sales commissions for our TechXtend segment due to our growth in this segment, the addition of employees in sales, finance and operations to support business growth and higher professional fees.
945983_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	As a result of the increase in net sales, SG A expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 5.2% in 2012, compared to 5.9% in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2012 were $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Total direct selling costs for our Lifeboat Distribution segment for 2012 were $4.5 million compared to $4.7 million in 2011, mainly due to lower commission and bonus expense compared to the prior year.
945983_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Total direct selling costs for our TechXtend segment for 2012 were $3.6 million compared to $3.1 million in 2011.
945983_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	The increase in the TechXtend segment was due to higher commission, salaries and bonus expense resulting from growth in the segment.
945983_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring our sales and remaining general and administrative expenses closely.

945983_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	This dollar increase was primarily the result of higher employee and employee-related costs (salaries, commissions, bonus accruals, benefits and travel and entertainment) of $1.1 million and increased credit card processing fees of $0.2 million due to increased sales volume.
945983_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2011 were $7.8 million compared to $6.9 million in 2010.

945983_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
945983_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
945983_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
945983_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.
945983_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
945983_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

945983_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
945983_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

945983_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards.
945983_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	In connection with valuing stock options, we use the Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions.
945983_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate.
945983_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	In connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate.
945983_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods.
945983_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.

945983_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
945983_13_ITEM15_P37_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
945983_13_ITEM15_P37_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
945983_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

945983_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
945983_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
945983_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to accounting for allowance for uncollectible accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation and obsolescence, income taxes, depreciation, contingencies and stock-based compensation.
945983_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
945983_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share .
945983_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.
945983_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities including unexercised stock option grants and nonvested shares of restricted stock.
945983_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations follows:
945983_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company considers all liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

945983_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	Allowances for potential uncollectible amounts are estimated and deducted from total accounts receivable.
945983_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	We provide allowances for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
945983_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	We take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks.
945983_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	If actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected, additional allowances may be required.
945983_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	Assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the year.
945983_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Cumulative translation adjustments have been classified within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity in accordance FASB ASC Topic No. 220, Comprehensive Income .

945983_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
945983_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company accounts for marketable securities pursuant to the FASB ASC Topic No. 320, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
945983_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Under this statement, the Company s securities with a readily determinable fair value have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders Equity.
945983_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments.
945983_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Inventory, consisting primarily of finished products held for resale, is stated at the lower of cost (weighted average) or market.
945983_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.

945983_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable are increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years.
945983_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	The amounts under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable.
945983_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income for the period, the impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on investments.
945983_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The foreign currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in international subsidiaries.
945983_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Revenue on product (software and hardware) and maintenance agreement sales are recognized once four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the price is fixed and determinable, (3) delivery (software and hardware) or fulfillment (maintenance) has occurred, and (4) there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds.
945983_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Revenues from the sales of hardware products, software products and licenses and maintenance agreements are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales.
945983_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Product delivery to customers occur in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from the Company s warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses.
945983_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company leverages drop-ship arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products to customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouse, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs.
945983_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company recognizes revenue for drop-ship arrangements on a gross basis.
945983_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	Furthermore, in such drop-ship arrangements, the Company negotiates price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers.
945983_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	The Company serves as the principal with the customer and, therefore, recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped.
945983_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Maintenance agreements allow customers to obtain technical support directly from the software publisher and to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced by the software publisher during the period that the maintenance agreement is in effect.
945983_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns.
945983_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	Vendor rebates and price protection are recorded when earned as a reduction to cost of sales or merchandise inventory, as applicable.
945983_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Cooperative reimbursements from vendors, which are earned and available, are recorded in the period the related advertising expenditure is incurred.
945983_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	Cooperative reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-50 Accounting by a Customer (including reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.

945983_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
945983_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
945983_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	This method also requires a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
945983_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income , an amendment to FASB ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income .

945983_13_ITEM15_P74_S2	The amendments in the update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
945983_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
945983_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12 Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
945983_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	This update stated that the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred.
945983_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income .
945983_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	This update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period.
945983_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012.
945983_13_ITEM15_P76_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

945983_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company uses the following methods for determining fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820.
945983_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets for the identical asset or liability, the total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs (Level 1).
945983_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data (Level 2).
945983_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	For all remaining assets and liabilities for which there are no significant observable inputs, fair value is derived using an assessment of various discount rates, default risk, credit quality and the overall capital market liquidity (Level 3).
945983_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The following table summarizes the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet:
945983_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Certificates of deposit - The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated using third-party quotations for similar assets.

945983_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company receives a tax deduction from the gains realized by employees on the exercise of certain non-qualified stock options for which the tax effect of the difference between the book and tax deduction is recognized as a component of stockholders equity.
945983_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainties in accordance with FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes .
945983_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	This standard clarified the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes.
945983_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	The standard prescribes criteria for recognition and measurement of tax positions.
945983_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and disclosures related to income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions.
945983_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions.
945983_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Company has identified its federal consolidated tax return and its state tax return in New Jersey and its Canadian tax return as major tax jurisdictions.

945983_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company, us, we, or our ) is an information technology ( IT ) channel company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We distribute software developed by others through resellers indirectly to customers worldwide.
945983_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	We also resell computer software and hardware developed by others and provide technical services directly to customers in the United States of America ( USA ) and Canada.
945983_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	We offer an extensive line of products from leading publishers of software and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.
945983_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Wayside Technology Group, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1982.
945983_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol WSTG .
945983_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our main web site address is www.waysidetechnology.com, and the other web sites maintained by our business include www.lifeboatdistribution.com, and www.techxtend.com.
945983_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Reference to these uniform resource locators or URLs is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.
945983_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Lifeboat Distribution segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.
945983_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The TechXtend segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.
945983_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products.
945983_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P7_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of the right IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	While software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not, however, attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels.
945983_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	There can be no assurances, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we can sell their products.
945983_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Acronis, Bluebeam Software, CA Technologies, DataCore, Datawatch, Dell/Dell Software, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SAP/Sybase, SmartBear, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Telerik, Unitrends, Veeam Software and VMware.
945983_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio, catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 6% of our overall net sales in 2013 and 4% of net sales in 2012 and 2011.
945983_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company had three customers that accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2013.
945983_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, Software House International Corporation ( SHI ), CDW Corporation ( CDW ) and Insight Enterprises, Inc. ( Insight ) accounted for 14.9%, 13.8% and 12.2%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2013, 12.7%, 12.3%, and 9.5%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable.
945983_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, SHI, CDW, and Insight accounted for 13.4%, 12.4% and 11.1%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.
945983_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, CDW, Insight and SHI accounted for 14.0%, 11.0% and 10.5%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.
945983_14_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our top five customers accounted for 48%, 44%, and 42% of consolidated net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
945983_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	This allows for minimum backlog in the business.
945983_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Sales to customers in Canada represented 7% of our consolidated revenues in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011.
945983_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 Dell/Quest Software was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 10.2% of our total purchases.
945983_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012 Dell/Quest Software was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 13.4% of our total purchases.
945983_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, Veeam and Quest accounted for 12.6% and 11.2%, respectively, of our total purchases.
945983_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2013, the Company purchased approximately 93% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 91% and 90% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
945983_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company operates distribution facilities in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and Mississauga, Canada.
945983_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Company conducts its business under the various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution and TechXtend.
945983_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.

945983_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	In January 2004, we adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct.
945983_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	The full text of the Code of Ethical Conduct, which applies to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is available at our web site, http://www.waysidetechnology.com, under Corporate Governance.

945983_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Reference to the uniform resource locators or URLs contained in this section is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The ongoing effects of the general economic downturn, especially outside of the USA, continues to cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We Depend on Having Creditworthy Customers to Avoid an Adverse Impact to Our Operating Results and Financial Condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Furthermore, if any of our customers to whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of financing revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	During 2013 and 2012 we did not have any cybersecurity breaches.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Risks Related to Our Common Stock .
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The exercise of outstanding options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Without a larger float, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market.
945983_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
945983_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company leases 18,000 square feet of space in Shrewsbury, New Jersey for its corporate headquarters and warehouse under a lease expiring in February 2016.

945983_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no material legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject.

945983_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay comparable cash dividends in the future.
945983_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	During 2013, the Company granted a total of 56,500 shares of Restricted Stock to officers and employees.
945983_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	Included in these grants were 40,000 Restricted Shares granted to the Company s CEO in accordance with the satisfaction of certain performance criteria included in his compensation plan.

945983_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	The issuances were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D thereunder, as they were transactions by the issuer that did not involve public offerings of securities and/or involved issuances to accredited investors.
945983_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	As of January 30, 2014 there were approximately 30 record holders of our Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM5_P8_S1	This figure does not include an estimate of the number of beneficial holders whose shares are held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
945983_14_ITEM5_P9_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock as follows:
945983_14_ITEM5_P10_S0	(1) Includes 9,804 shares surrendered to the Company by employees to satisfy individual tax withholding obligations upon vesting of previously issued shares of Restricted Stock.

945983_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
945983_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	We strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report, particularly the risks described under Item 1A. Risk Factors above.

945983_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
945983_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.

945983_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The statements concerning future sales, future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward looking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products, product mix, pricing pressures, market conditions and other factors, which could result in a fluctuation of sales below recent experience.
945983_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods.
945983_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher postage and operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net sales totaled $300.4 million in 2013 as compared to $297.1 million in 2012, representing a 1% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Gross profit increased by $0.5 million or 2% in 2013 as compared to 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased by $0.1 million in 2013 as compared to 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Income from operations amounted to $8.9 million in 2013 as compared to $8.5 million in 2012, representing an increase of $0.4 million or 4% as compared to 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	This increase resulted from the increase in total sales and total gross margin (Lifeboat Distribution segment increased offset by a decrease in TechXtend segment) offset by a slight increase in SG A expenses.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Our income before provision for income taxes increased by $0.3 million to $9.4 million in 2013 compared to $9.1 million in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	We reported a net income of $6.4 million for 2013 compared to $5.5 million in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, level of extended payment terms sales transactions, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings, fluctuations in response rates, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings.
945983_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts.
945983_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.
945983_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
945983_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:
945983_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net sales for 2013 increased 1%, or $3.3 million to $300.4 million in 2013 compared to $297.1 million in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Total sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2013 were $237.7 million compared to $217.3 million in 2012, representing a 9% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Total sales for the TechXtend segment in 2013 amounted to $62.8 million, compared to $79.7 million in 2012, representing a 21% decrease.
945983_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The increase in net sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the strengthening of our account penetration, our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business and the addition of several key product lines; primarily on sales generated out of the USA sales office.
945983_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The 21% decrease in sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to a decrease in large single sales transactions and a decrease in extended payment terms sales transactions in the first three quarters of 2013 as compared to exceptionally strong levels of large single sales transactions and extended payment terms sales transactions in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross Profit for 2013 was $24.4 million compared to $23.9 million in 2012, a 2% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Total gross profit for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2013 was $17.4 million compared to $15.8 million in 2012, representing a 10% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase in gross profit for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was due to increased sales volume as gross profit margin remained relatively stable.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Total gross profit for our TechXtend segment in 2013 was $6.9 million compared to $8.1 million in 2012, representing a 14% decrease.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	The decrease in gross profit for the TechXtend segment was the result primarily of decreased software sales volume, including a decrease in large single sale transactions and extended payment terms sales transactions, offset in part by a higher gross margin in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily on software sales.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	Vendor rebates and discounts for 2013 improved and amounted to $1.7 million compared to $1.5 million for 2012, representing a 13% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	The increase in vendor rebates and discounts as a percentage of net sales was experienced mainly at the TechXtend segment.
945983_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for 2013 was 8.1% compared to 8.0% in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Gross profit margin for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was consistent at 7.3% in 2013 and 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	Gross profit margin for our TechXtend segment in 2013 was 11.0% compared to 10.1% in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	This increase is due to increased pricing and vendor rebates in 2013 as compared to 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in gross profit dollars and the increase in gross profit margins were primarily caused by the sales growth within our Lifeboat Distribution segment and increase in pricing and an increase in rebates earned at our TechXtend segment.
945983_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company monitors gross profits and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Price competition in our market persisted in 2013.
945983_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Although our total gross profit margins improved slightly in 2013, we anticipate that margins, as well as discounts and rebates, will continue to be under pressure in the near future.
945983_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Total selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses for 2013 were $15.5 million compared to $15.4 million in 2012, representing an increase of $0.1 million or 0.8%.
945983_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	This increase is primarily the result of an increase in sales commissions and bonus for our Lifeboat segment due to our growth in this segment, increase in operations bonus, the addition of employees in TechXtend government sales, finance and operations to support business growth offset by a decrease in TechXtend sales commissions and bonus due to decrease in this segment and a decrease in legal and consulting fees.
945983_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 5.2% in each of 2013 and 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2013 were $8.0 million compared to $8.1 million in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Total direct selling costs for our Lifeboat Distribution segment for 2013 were $4.7 million compared to $4.5 million in 2012, mainly due to increased commission and bonus expense compared to the prior year on higher segment gross profit and income.
945983_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Total direct selling costs for our TechXtend segment for 2013 were $3.3 million compared to $3.6 million in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	The decrease in the TechXtend segment was due to lower commission and bonus expense resulting from lower segment gross profit and segment income which are the bases for calculating commission and bonus expense offset by an increase in government sales salaries.
945983_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring our sales and general and administrative expenses closely.
945983_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.0 million which consists of a provision of $2.9 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.1 million provision for foreign taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.1 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The current year effective tax rate was 32.1% compared to 39.6% in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a change in the state of New Jersey s apportionment rules which lowered our state rate compared with the prior year.
945983_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $0.4 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.6 million which consists of a provision of $2.8 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.5 million provision for state and local taxes, a $0.2 million provision for foreign taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.1 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $0.5 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net sales for 2012 increased 19%, or $46.9 million to $297.1 million in 2012 compared to $250.2 million in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Total sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2012 were $217.3 million compared to $192.7 million in 2011, representing a 13% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Total sales for the TechXtend segment in 2012 amounted to $79.7 million, compared to $57.4 million in 2011, representing a 39% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in net sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the strengthening of our account penetration, our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business and the addition of several key product lines.
945983_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The 39% increase in sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to an increase in larger extended payment term transactions, solution focus selling and higher average order sizes in 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross Profit for 2012 was $23.9 million compared to $23.2 million in 2011, a 3% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total gross profit for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was $15.8 million compared to $16.8 million in 2011, representing a 6% decrease.
945983_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	The decrease in gross profit for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was due to lower vendor rebate attainment and competitive pricing pressure within this segment.
945983_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	Total gross profit for our TechXtend segment was $8.1 million compared to $6.4 million in 2011, representing a 25% increase.
945983_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increase in gross profit for the TechXtend segment was the result of increased sales volume offset in part by a lower gross margin in 2012 as compared to 2011 and lower vendor rebates.
945983_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Vendor rebates and discounts for 2012 amounted to $1.8 million compared to $2.9 million for 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors.
945983_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Vendors have been periodically substantially increasing their target revenues for rebate eligibility.
945983_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Therefore, despite our increasing revenue, vendor rebates have declined.
945983_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for 2012 was 8.0% compared to 9.3% in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Gross profit margin for our Lifeboat Distribution segment in 2012 was 7.3% compared to 8.7% in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Gross profit margin for our TechXtend segment in 2012 was 10.1% compared to 11.2% in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The increase in gross profit dollars and the decrease in gross profit margins were primarily caused by the sales growth within our Lifeboat Distribution and TechXtend segments, offset in part, by continued pressure on discounts and rebates earned and competitive pricing pressure in both segments, and, in part, by our having won several large bids, including transactions on extended payment terms, based on aggressive pricing.
945983_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company monitors gross profits and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Price competition in our market intensified further in 2012, with competitors lowering their prices significantly and the Company responding immediately.
945983_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Although our sales volume increased substantially as a result, gross margins, as well as the rebates and discounts that are material elements of the Company s overall profitability, were negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Total selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses for 2012 were $15.4 million compared to $14.6 million in 2011, representing an increase of $0.8 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	This increase is primarily the result of an increase in sales commissions for our TechXtend segment due to our growth in this segment, the addition of employees in sales, finance and operations to support business growth and higher professional fees.
945983_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	As a result of the increase in net sales, SG A expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 5.2% in 2012, compared to 5.9% in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Direct selling costs (a component of SG A) for 2012 were $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Total direct selling costs for our Lifeboat Distribution segment for 2012 were $4.5 million compared to $4.7 million in 2011, mainly due to lower commission and bonus expense compared to the prior year.
945983_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Total direct selling costs for our TechXtend segment for 2012 were $3.6 million compared to $3.1 million in 2011.
945983_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	The increase in the TechXtend segment was due to higher commission, salaries and bonus expense resulting from growth in the segment.
945983_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.6 million which consists of a provision of $2.8 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.5 million provision for state and local taxes, a $0.2 million provision for foreign taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.1 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $0.5 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.4 million which consists of a provision of $2.4 million for U.S. federal income taxes, as well as a $0.5 million provision for state and local taxes, a $0.3 million provision for foreign taxes, and a deferred tax expense of $0.3 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $0.6 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income .
945983_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	This update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period.
945983_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $9.8 million to $19.6 million at December 31, 2013 from $9.8 million at December 31, 2012.
945983_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $10.3 million, net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $4.2 million, and net cash used in financing activities amounted to $4.8 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $10.3 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	In 2013, cash was mainly provided by $8.1 million from net income net of non-cash charges, a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million decrease in inventory, and a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable, offset in part by an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $0.8 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	In 2013, cash provided by investing activities was $4.2 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	This resulted primarily from $4.4 million net redemptions of available-for-sale marketable securities.
945983_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	These securities are highly rated and highly liquid.
945983_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	These securities are classified as available-for-sale securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320 Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and as a result, unrealized gains and losses are reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income.
945983_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	This was partially offset by $0.2 million for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements.
945983_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net cash used in financing activities in 2013 of $4.8 million consisted of $3.0 million of dividend payments on our Common Stock and $2.1 million for the purchases of treasury shares of our Common Stock offset by the tax benefit from share based compensation of $0.2 million and the exercise of stock options of $0.2 million.
945983_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	In 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 500,000 shares of our Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 1,490,000 shares of our Common Stock.
945983_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	In October 1999, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to buy back 521,013 shares of our Common Stock in both open market and private transactions, as conditions warrant.
945983_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	A total of 2,296,066 shares of the Company s stock had been bought back as of December 31, 2013 leaving a balance of 214,947 shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to buy back in the future.
945983_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Board of Directors approved, and on October 29, 2012, the Company entered into a written purchase plan intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended (the Plan ).

945983_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.

945983_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

945983_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
945983_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

945983_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards.
945983_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	In connection with valuing stock options, we use the Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions.
945983_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate.
945983_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	In connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate.
945983_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods.
945983_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.

945983_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013.
945983_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
945983_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
945983_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

945983_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

945983_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

945983_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

945983_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
945983_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory obsolescence, income taxes, depreciation, contingencies and stock-based compensation.

945983_14_ITEM15_P44_S2	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities including unexercised stock option grants and nonvested shares of restricted stock.
945983_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations follows:

945983_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	We take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks.

945983_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The TechXtend segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.
945983_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products.
945983_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	the right IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	While software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels.
945983_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we can sell their products.

945983_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio, catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 7% , 6% and 4% of our overall net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
945983_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company had three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2014.

945983_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	This results in minimum backlog in the business.
945983_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Sales to customers in Canada represented 7% of our consolidated revenues in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012.
945983_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.

945983_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.

945983_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_15_ITEM1_P23_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014, Sophos was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 14.7% of our total purchases.

945983_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 2014, the Company purchased approximately 95% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 93% and 91% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
945983_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company operates distribution facilities in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and Mississauga, Canada.
945983_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution and TechXtend.
945983_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.

945983_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Reference to the uniform resource locators or URLs contained in this section is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The ongoing effects of the general economic downturn, especially outside of the USA, continues to cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We Depend on Having Creditworthy Customers to Avoid an Adverse Impact to Our Operating Results and Financial Condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Furthermore, if any of our customers to whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of financing revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	During 2014 and 2013 we did not have any cybersecurity breaches.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Risks Related to Our Common Stock .
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The exercise of outstanding options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Without a larger float, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market.
945983_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

945983_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher postage and operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of the Company s Common Stock.

945983_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	We reported a net income of $5.8 million for 2014 compared to $6.4 million in 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, level of extended payment terms sales transactions, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings, fluctuations in response rates, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings.

945983_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The 22% increase in net sales from our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business, the addition of several key product lines, and the strengthening of our account penetration.
945983_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The 20% decrease in net sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to a decrease in extended payment terms sales transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.

945983_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The decrease in gross profit for the TechXtend segment was the result primarily of decreased software sales volume, including a decrease in large single sale transactions and extended payment terms sales transactions, offset in part by a higher gross margin in 2014 as compared to 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for 2014 was 7.3% compared to 8.1% in 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Gross profit margin for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was 6.6% in 2014 compared to 7.3% in and 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was primarily caused by competitive pricing pressure, reduced vendor rebates and discounts, and product mix.
945983_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Gross profit margin for our TechXtend segment in 2014 was 11.2% compared to 11.0% in 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	The Increase in gross profit dollars and the decrease in gross profit margins were primarily caused by the sales growth and product mix within our Lifeboat Distribution segment which carries lower margins than our TechXtend segment.
945983_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Vendor rebates and discounts for 2014 amounted to $1.6 million compared to $1.7 million for 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors.
945983_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Vendors have been periodically substantially increasing their target revenues for rebate eligibility.
945983_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company monitors gross profits and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Price competition in our market continued to intensify in 2014, with competitors lowering their prices significantly and the Company continues to respond immediately.
945983_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	We anticipate that margins, as well as discounts and rebates, will continue to be affected by this current trend.
945983_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	To the extent that the Company finances larger transactions with extended payment terms, as anticipated, gross margins also will be negatively impacted.
945983_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Total selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses for 2014 were $16.5 million compared to $15.5 million in 2013, representing an increase of $1.0 million or 6.5%.
945983_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	This increase is primarily the result of an increase in salaries, commissions and bonus expense for our Lifeboat Distribution segment due to our growth in this segment.
945983_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.8% in 2014 compared to 5.2% in 2013.

945983_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Total direct selling costs for our TechXtend segment for 2014 were $3.1 million compared to $3.3 million in 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	The decrease in the TechXtend segment was due to lower commission and bonus expense resulting from lower segment gross profit.
945983_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring our sales and general and administrative expenses closely.

945983_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The current year effective tax rates are higher primarily due to the fact that the prior year included an adjustment to reflect a change in state apportionment rules.

945983_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The increase in net sales for our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the strengthening of our account penetration, our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business and the addition of several key product lines; primarily on sales generated out of the USA sales office.
945983_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The 21% decrease in sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to a decrease in large single sales transactions and a decrease in extended payment terms sales transactions in the first three quarters of 2013 as compared to exceptionally strong levels of large single sales transactions and extended payment terms sales transactions in 2012.

945983_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	This increase is due to increased pricing and vendor rebates in 2013 as compared to 2012.
945983_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The increase in gross profit dollars and the increase in gross profit margins were primarily caused by the sales growth within our Lifeboat Distribution segment and increase in pricing and an increase in rebates earned at our TechXtend segment.

945983_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Price competition in our market persisted in 2013.
945983_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	Although our total gross profit margins improved slightly in 2013, we anticipate that margins, as well as discounts and rebates, will continue to be under pressure in the near future.

945983_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	This increase is primarily the result of an increase in sales commissions and bonus for our Lifeboat segment due to our growth in this segment, increase in operations bonus, the addition of employees in TechXtend government sales, finance and operations to support business growth offset by a decrease in TechXtend sales commissions and bonus due to decrease in this segment and a decrease in legal and consulting fees.

945983_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
945983_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
945983_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of software and hardware for microcomputers, servers and networks on a gross revenue recognition basis upon shipment or upon electronic delivery of the product.
945983_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
945983_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
945983_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
945983_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.
945983_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
945983_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
945983_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
945983_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
945983_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
945983_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
945983_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
945983_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards.
945983_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	In connection with valuing stock options, we use the Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions.
945983_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate.
945983_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	In connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate.
945983_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods.
945983_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
945983_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In addition to its activities in the USA, 7% of the Company s 2014 sales were generated in Canada.

945983_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.
945983_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
945983_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
945983_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
945983_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
945983_15_ITEM15_P29_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
945983_15_ITEM15_P29_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
945983_15_ITEM15_P29_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
945983_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
945983_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
945983_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
945983_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to above, we also audited the consolidated financial statement schedule, Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.
945983_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	In our opinion, this financial schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information stated therein.

945983_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
945983_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
945983_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory obsolescence, income taxes, depreciation, contingencies and stock-based compensation.
945983_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
945983_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share .
945983_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.
945983_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities including unexercised stock option grants and nonvested shares of restricted stock.
945983_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations follows:
945983_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company considers all liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

945983_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	We take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks.
945983_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	If actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected, additional allowances may be required.

945983_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
945983_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments.
945983_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company s accounts receivable long-term is discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates so the balances approximate fair value.
945983_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Inventory, consisting primarily of finished products held for resale, is stated at the lower of cost (weighted average) or market.

945983_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	Furthermore, in such drop-ship arrangements, the Company negotiates price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers.
945983_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company serves as the principal with the customer and, therefore, recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped.
945983_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	Maintenance agreements allow customers to obtain technical support directly from the software publisher and to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced by the software publisher during the period that the maintenance agreement is in effect.

945983_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
945983_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
945983_15_ITEM15_P65_S2	This method also requires a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
945983_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense when assessed.

945983_15_ITEM15_P66_S4	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and disclosures related to income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions.
945983_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance.
945983_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue.
945983_15_ITEM15_P67_S2	The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
945983_15_ITEM15_P67_S3	The standard is effective for our reporting year beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted.
945983_15_ITEM15_P67_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting pronouncement, if any; the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements.

945983_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The current year effective tax rates are higher than the prior year primarily due to fact the prior year included an adjustment to reflect a change in state apportionment rules.
945983_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	The reasons for the difference between total tax expense and the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes are as follows:
945983_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company receives a tax deduction from the income realized by employees on the exercise of certain non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards for which the tax effect of the difference between the book and tax deduction is recognized as a component of stockholders equity.

945983_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions it takes and expects to take on its tax returns, and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.

945983_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	As permitted by FASB ASC Topic 280, the Company has utilized the aggregation criteria in combining its operations in Canada with the domestic segments as they provide the same products and services to similar clients and are considered together when the CODM decides how to allocate resources.
945983_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Segment income is based on segment revenue less the respective segment s cost of revenues as well as segment direct costs (including such items as payroll costs and payroll related costs, such as profit sharing, incentive awards and insurance) and excluding general and administrative expenses not attributed to a business unit.
945983_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	The Company only identifies accounts receivable and inventory by segment as shown below as Selected Assets by segment; it does not allocate its other assets, including capital expenditures by segment.

945983_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol WSTG .
945983_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our main web site address is www.waysidetechnology.com, and the other web sites maintained by our business include www.lifeboatdistribution.com, and www.techxtend.com.
945983_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	Reference to these uniform resource locators or URLs is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.
945983_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Lifeboat Distribution segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.
945983_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The TechXtend segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.
945983_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products.
945983_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of the right IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	While software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels.
945983_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we can sell their products.
945983_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Acronis, Bluebeam Software, CA Technologies, Dell/Dell Software, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, JetBrains, Lenovo, Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SAP/Sybase, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Telerik, Unitrends, Veeam Software and VMware.
945983_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio, catalogs and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Since the Company predominantly sells software, sales of hardware and peripherals represented only 10%, 7% and 6% of our overall net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
945983_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, print and electronic catalogs.
945983_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2015.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Software House International Corporation ( SHI ), and CDW Corporation ( CDW ) accounted for 19.0%, and 17.9%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2015, 14.0%, and 21.9%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	The Company had three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2014.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014, SHI, CDW, and Insight Enterprises, Inc. ( Insight ) accounted for 17.4%, 16.4% and 11.0%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2013, SHI, CDW, and Insight accounted for 14.9%, 13.8% and 12.2%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.
945983_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	Our top five customers accounted for 52%, 52%, and 48% of consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
945983_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	This results in minimum backlog in the business.
945983_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Sales to customers in Canada represented 6% of our consolidated revenue in 2015, and 7% in each of 2014 and 2013.
945983_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, process products ordered and respond to customer inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sophos was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 24.2% of our total purchases.
945983_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014, Sophos was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 14.7% of our total purchases.
945983_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, Dell/Quest Software was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 10.2% of our total purchases.
945983_16_ITEM1_P26_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 2015, the Company purchased approximately 96% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 95% and 93% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
945983_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company operates distribution facilities in Eatontown, New Jersey and Mississauga, Canada.
945983_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution and TechXtend.

945983_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our catalogs and on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The ongoing effects of the general economic downturn, especially outside of the USA, continues to cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We depend on having creditworthy customers to avoid an adverse impact to our operating results and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Furthermore, if any of our customers to whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of financing revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	During 2015 and 2014 we did not have any cybersecurity breaches.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Risks related to our common stock .
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The exercise of outstanding options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Without a larger float, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market.
945983_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

945983_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.
945983_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Lifeboat Distribution segment distributes technical software and hardware to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.
945983_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The TechXtend segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.
945983_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	The software market is highly competitive.
945983_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.
945983_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	The Company expects pricing pressure to continue.
945983_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources.
945983_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products.
945983_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_17_ITEM1_P7_S4	Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition.
945983_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation for successfully bringing new products to market and its relationships with software publishers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	While some software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels.
945983_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business .
945983_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we can sell their products.
945983_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Dell/Dell Software, erwin, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Micro Focus Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Unitrends, Veeam Software and VMware.
945983_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio, and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company predominantly sells software, software subscriptions, and maintenance.
945983_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Sales of hardware and peripherals represented 10%, 10% and 7% of our overall net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

945983_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2016.

945983_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	This results in minimum backlog in the business.
945983_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Sales to customers in Canada represented 7%, 6%, and 7% of our consolidated revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
945983_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Sales in Europe and the rest of the world represented 6%, 6%, and 7% of our consolidate revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

945983_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively, and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_17_ITEM1_P24_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sophos and Solarwinds accounted for 23.1% and 10.8%, respectively of our consolidated purchases.

945983_17_ITEM1_P27_S4	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	In 2016, the Company purchased approximately 96% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 96% and 95% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
945983_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers and customers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.

945983_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution, TechXtend and International Software Partners.
945983_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.

945983_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	In January 2004, we adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct.
945983_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	The full text of the Code of Ethical Conduct, which applies to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is available at our web site, http://www.waysidetechnology.com, under Governance.

945983_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Reference to the uniform resource locators or URLs contained in this section is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be part of this report.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P3_S7	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Generally, economic downturns, may cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We depend on having creditworthy customers to avoid an adverse impact to our operating results and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of financing revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We operate in a very competitive business environment.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Like other companies in the technology distribution industry, the Company s business is continually under pricing pressure and characterized by narrow gross and operating margins.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These narrow margins magnify the impact on the Company s operating results attributed to variations in sales and operating costs and place a premium on our ability to leverage our infrastructure.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Future gross and operating margins may be adversely affected by changes in product mix, vendor pricing actions and competitive and economic pressures.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, failure to attract new sources of business from expansion of products or services or entry into new markets may adversely affect future gross and operating margins.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we lose several of our larger customers our earnings may be affected.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our contracts for the provision of products are generally non-exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon 30 days notice.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, our agreements with these larger customers do not provide for minimum purchase commitments.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	The loss of several of our large customers, the failure of such customers to pay their accounts receivable on a timely basis, or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	During 2016 and 2015 we did not have any cybersecurity breaches.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Risks related to our common stock .
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The exercise of options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Without a larger float, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NASDAQ.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the software and some service industries.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:
945983_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.
945983_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.

945983_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments.
945983_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Lifeboat Distribution segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.

945983_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel.
945983_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers.
945983_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.
945983_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required.
945983_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	To date, we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering ( EDI ) and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined.
945983_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Selling general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees.
945983_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business.
945983_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, level of extended payment terms sales transactions, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings.
945983_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts.
945983_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.
945983_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program.
945983_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.
945983_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	$3.2 and $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and $3.2 million and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.
945983_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock.
945983_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net sales increased 9%, or $36 million, to $418.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $382.1 million for the same period in 2015.

945983_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	Weighted Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3% from the prior year, primarily due to the Company s share buyback program.
945983_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	Income per share diluted increased 5% to $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.25 for the same period in 2015.
945983_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
945983_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
945983_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Revenues from the sales of hardware products, software products, licenses, maintenance and subscription agreements are recognized on a gross basis upon delivery or fulfillment, with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales.
945983_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
945983_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
945983_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
945983_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.
945983_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
945983_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, and specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers.
945983_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
945983_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.
945983_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates.
945983_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors.
945983_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
945983_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
945983_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
945983_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
945983_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
945983_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards.
945983_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	In connection with valuing stock options, we use the Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions.
945983_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The key assumptions we make are: the expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the award; and the expected forfeiture rate.
945983_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	In connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate.
945983_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods.
945983_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-14 ( ASU 2015-14 ) which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Along with the deferral of the effective date, ASU No. 2015-14 allows early application as of the original effective date.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	The standard and related amendments will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.
945983_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	The Company is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations, the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the Company s customer, which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)", ("ASU 2015-11").
945983_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market value represented by replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
945983_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
945983_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement, will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09").
945983_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
945983_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").
945983_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.
945983_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases.
945983_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
945983_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13").
945983_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded.
945983_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
945983_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on it consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-15 ) ASU 2016-15 which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
945983_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted.
945983_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	This amendment is intended to improve accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	In accordance with this guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application.
945983_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
945983_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:
945983_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 9%, or $36.0 million, to $418.1 million, compared to $382.1 million for the same period in 2015.
945983_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Net sales increased in both our Lifeboat Distribution segment and our TechXtend segment.
945983_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $29.8 million, or 9% to $369.5 million, compared to $339.7 million for the same period a year earlier.
945983_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase was primarily due to increased penetration of existing products into new and existing distribution partner accounts, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
945983_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and distribution accounts due to competitive bid situations.
945983_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We operate in a competitive market in which some sales agreements are subject to periodic competitive bidding processes, resulting in fluctuations from year to year based on the outcome.

945983_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher sales to major accounts on extended payment terms, partially offset by the impact of a reduced number of sales people and lower revenues from marketing services.
945983_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	We extend payment terms on some enterprise account sales, typically for periods of one to three years, to provide flexibility for our customers.
945983_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	We reduced our number of sales people late in 2015 to streamline and focus our operations on opportunities with the highest financial return.

945983_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was primarily caused by competitive pricing pressure and product mix.
945983_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	trend has been for gross profit margins to decline for the past several years.
945983_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	We attribute some of the decline to an increasing portion of our revenues coming from the sale of licenses, maintenance and service agreements that are not associated with a physical product.
945983_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	While our gross profit margin has declined on these products, we have been able to maintain our profitability through efficiencies gained in electronic ordering and distribution through the use of EDI and other automation.

945983_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	The decrease in gross profit margin was due to competitive market pricing, particularly on larger enterprise sales.
945983_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	Sales of large enterprise licenses typically carry a lower gross profit margin, and lower incremental selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue, than smaller account sales.
945983_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Vendor rebates and discounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.0 million.

945983_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company monitors vendor rebate levels, competitive pricing, and gross profit margins carefully.

945983_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased stock based compensation and employee related expenses to support our growth, costs related to the relocation to our new offices in October, 2016, and professional expenses related to public company compliance.
945983_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Selling, General Administrative expenses were 4.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 4.7% for the same period in 2015.

945983_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The 17% increase in net sales from our Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the addition of several key product lines and our ongoing strategy of strengthening of our account penetration.
945983_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The 16% decrease in net sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to a decrease in both extended payment terms sales transactions and large transactions as compared to the same period in 2014.

945983_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	We anticipate that margins, as well as discounts and rebates, will continue to be affected by this current trend.
945983_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	To the extent that the Company finances larger transactions with extended payment terms, as anticipated, gross margins also will be negatively impacted.

945983_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
945983_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, discount rates applicable to long term receivables, inventory obsolescence, income taxes, depreciation, contingencies and stock-based compensation.

945983_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	We take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks.
945983_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	If actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected, additional allowances may be required.

945983_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments.
945983_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company s accounts receivable long-term is discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale which approximates fair value as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

945983_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	Furthermore, in such drop-ship arrangements, the Company negotiates price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers.
945983_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	maintenance and subscription agreement is in effect.
945983_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company serves as the principal with the customer and, therefore, recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped or the contract has been fulfilled.

945983_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
945983_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
945983_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	This method also requires a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
945983_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense when assessed.

945983_17_ITEM15_P67_S4	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and disclosures related to income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions.

945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S2	The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-14 ( ASU 2015-14 ) which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S4	Along with the deferral of the effective date, ASU No. 2015-14 allows early application as of the original effective date.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S5	Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S6	The standard and related amendments will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.
945983_17_ITEM15_P68_S7	The Company is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations, the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the Company s customers, which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)", ("ASU 2015-11").
945983_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market value represented by replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
945983_17_ITEM15_P69_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
945983_17_ITEM15_P69_S3	ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_17_ITEM15_P69_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement, will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09").
945983_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
945983_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_17_ITEM15_P70_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").
945983_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.
945983_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases.
945983_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.

945983_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.

945983_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1982.
945983_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol WSTG .
945983_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our main web site address is www.waysidetechnology.com, and the other web sites maintained by our business include www.lifeboatdistribution.com, and www.techxtend.com.
945983_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	Reference to these uniform resource locators or URLs is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only.
945983_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
945983_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	In our Lifeboat segment, we distribute technology products from software developers, publishers or equipment manufacturers to resellers, and system integrators worldwide.
945983_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	We purchase software, maintenance/service agreements, networking/storage/security equipment and complementary products from our vendors and sell them to our reseller customers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Generally, a vendor authorizes a limited of number of companies to act as distributors of their product and sell to resellers of their product.
945983_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national IT superstores.
945983_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	We combine our core strengths in customer service, marketing, distribution, credit and billing to allow our customers to achieve greater efficiencies in time to market in the IT channel in a cost effective manner.
945983_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our Lifeboat Distribution business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and price competition.
945983_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	In our Lifeboat segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for the products we sell, and on our partners strategic initiatives and business models.
945983_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new products, replacement and renewal cycles for existing products, competitive products, overall economic growth and general business activity.
945983_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the industry and increased price-based competition.
945983_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We also provide comprehensive IT solutions directly to end users through our TechXtend segment.
945983_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Products in this segment are acquired directly from equipment manufacturers, software developers or distributors and sold to end users.
945983_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	We provide customer service, billing, sales and marketing support in this segment and also provide extended payment terms to facilitate sales.
945983_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we become authorized distributors of their products.
945983_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Company offers a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Dell/Dell Software, erwin, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Micro Focus Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Unitrends, Veeam Software and VMware.
945983_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio, and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends.
945983_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Company predominantly sells software, software subscriptions, and maintenance.
945983_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Sales of hardware and peripherals represented 7%, 10%, and 10% of our overall net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, and social media.
945983_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
945983_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2017.
945983_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2017, Software House International Corporation ( SHI ), and CDW Corporation ( CDW ) accounted for 23.0%, and 19.4%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2017, 15.1% and 28.6%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable.
945983_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Software House International Corporation ( SHI ), and CDW Corporation ( CDW ) accounted for 19.6%, and 17.9%, respectively, of consolidated net sales, and, as of December 31, 2016, 13.3%, and 23.2%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable.
945983_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, SHI, and CDW Corporation accounted for 19.0%, and 17.9%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.
945983_18_ITEM1_P13_S4	Our top five customers accounted for 52%, 48%, and 52% of consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer s order.
945983_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	This results in minimum backlog in the business.
945983_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Sales to customers in Canada represented 7%, 7%, and 6% of our consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Sales in Europe and the rest of the world represented 6%, 6%, and 6% of our consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
945983_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively, and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth.
945983_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability.
945983_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	Substantially all of the Company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days notice or less.
945983_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
945983_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy.
945983_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2017, Sophos and Solarwinds accounted for 26.4% and 14.7%, respectively of our consolidated purchases.
945983_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sophos and Solarwinds accounted for 23.1% and 10.8%, respectively, of our consolidated purchases.
945983_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
945983_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	In 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company purchased approximately 96% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors.
945983_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Most suppliers or distributors will drop ship products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company.
945983_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Inventory management techniques, such as drop shipping allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
945983_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products.
945983_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	Moreover, the Company s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping.
945983_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) with its suppliers and customers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.
945983_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.
945983_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Company operates a distribution facility in Eatontown, New Jersey.
945983_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The software market is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices by both software distributors and resellers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	This has resulted in declining gross margins as a percentage of sales, which the Company expects to continue.
945983_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources competing principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
945983_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent, who also sell directly to the end-customers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	In the TechXtend segment, we compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products.
945983_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
945983_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company.
945983_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Company competes with other distributors and resellers to become an authorized distributor or reseller of products from software developers and publishers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	It also competes with distributors and resellers to attract prospective buyers, and to source new products from software developers and publishers, and to market its current product line to customers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of the desired IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively.
945983_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation for successfully bringing new products to market and the strength of and quality of its relationships with software publishers.
945983_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications.
945983_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand.
945983_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users.
945983_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices.
945983_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts.
945983_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	While some software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels.
945983_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do.
945983_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third-party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company s business operations and financial conditions.
945983_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services.
945983_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to Item 1.A. Risk Factors : We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell , and The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2008 and Windows 2012 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution.
945983_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, websites, e-mail and fax systems.
945983_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions.
945983_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
945983_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database.
945983_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
945983_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution, TechXtend and International Software Partners.
945983_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.
945983_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2017, Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries had 138 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees.

945983_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	General economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Generally, economic downturns, may cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The realization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We depend on having creditworthy customers to avoid an adverse impact to our operating results and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may require sufficient amounts of debt and/or equity capital to fund our transactions as we provide larger extended payment terms to certain of our customers.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses, we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital, a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Furthermore, if any of our customers to whom we provide larger extended payment terms go elsewhere for financing, such loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future, will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We operate in a very competitive business environment.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Like other companies in the technology distribution industry, the Company s business is continually under pricing pressure and characterized by narrow gross and operating margins.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These narrow margins magnify the impact on the Company s operating results attributed to variations in sales and operating costs and place a premium on our ability to leverage our infrastructure.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Future gross and operating margins may be adversely affected by changes in product mix, vendor pricing actions and competitive and economic pressures.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, failure to attract new sources of business from expansion of products or services or entry into new markets may adversely affect future gross and operating margins.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we lose several of our larger customers our earnings may be affected.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon 30 days notice.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, our agreements with these larger customers do not provide for minimum purchase commitments.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The loss of several of our large customers, the failure of such customers to pay their accounts receivable on a timely basis, or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Additionally, anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , partners and clients confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	During 2017 and 2016 we did not have any cybersecurity breaches.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We depend on certain key personnel.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Risks related to our common stock .
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The exercise of options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Without a larger float, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets .
945983_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An effective internal control environment is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Based on these evaluations, the Company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	During 2017, the Company determined it had a material weakness in its internal controls as is reported in Item 9a., Controls and Procedures.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	While management evaluates the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the Company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In addition, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NASDAQ.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the Company's access to capital.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As described under Item 9a., Controls and Procedures, we have identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have initiated remediation measures, but these new and enhanced controls have not operated for a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	To implement these remediation measures, we may need to commit additional resources, hire additional staff, and provide additional management oversight.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These activities may divert management s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Further, if our remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate our financial results.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the software and some service industries.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:
945983_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.
945983_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.
945983_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company leases approximately 20,000 square feet of space in Eatontown, New Jersey for its corporate headquarters under a lease expiring in March 2027.

945983_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our Company is an IT channel company, primarily selling software and other third-party IT products and services through two reportable operating segments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Through our Lifeboat Distribution segment we sell products and services to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide, who in turn sell these products to end users.
945983_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Through our TechXtend Segment we act as a value-added reseller, selling computer software and hardware developed by others and provide technical services directly to end user customers in the USA and Canada.
945983_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	We offer an extensive line of products from leading publishers of software and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.
945983_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	We market these products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, social media, direct e-mail, and printed materials.
945983_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company has subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands, through which its sales are made.
945983_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third-party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel, product lifecycle competitive, and demand characteristics of the products which we are authorized to distribute.
945983_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers.
945983_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.
945983_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required.
945983_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	To date, we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering ( EDI ) and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined.
945983_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Selling general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees.
945983_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business.
945983_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, level of extended payment terms sales transactions, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings.
945983_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts.
945983_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.
945983_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program.
945983_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.
945983_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $3.1 and $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $3.2 million and $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent on results of operations, projected capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors may find relevant.
945983_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The technology sector of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility.
945983_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock.
945983_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net sales increased 7%, or $31.2 million, to $449.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $418.1 million for the same period in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross profit decreased 1%, or $0.3 million, to $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $27.3 million in the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased 3%, or $0.5 million, to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $18.7 million in the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Net income decreased 14%, or $0.8 million, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.9 million in the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	Weighted Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 4.5% from the prior year, primarily due to the Company s share buyback program.
945983_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Income per share diluted decreased 10.3% to $1.13 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.25 for the same period in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
945983_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
945983_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenues from the sales of hardware products, software products, licenses, maintenance and subscription agreements are recognized on a gross basis upon delivery or fulfillment, with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
945983_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
945983_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
945983_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.
945983_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
945983_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience.
945983_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.
945983_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale.
945983_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other relevant factors.
945983_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
945983_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
945983_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets.
945983_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
945983_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
945983_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards.
945983_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In connection with our restricted stock programs we record the forfeitures when they occur.
945983_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods.
945983_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance.
945983_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued additional updates to the new accounting standard which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarifications.
945983_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
945983_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
945983_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).
945983_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, and early adoption as of January 1, 2017 is permitted.
945983_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company elected to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which will require the Company to recast our historical financial information for the years 2017 and 2016 to be consistent with the standard.
945983_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	with support, as well as maintenance, support and other services.
945983_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Historically, under the transfer of risk and rewards model of revenue recognition, the Company has accounted for primarily all of its sales on a gross basis.
945983_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The new guidance requires the Company to identify performance obligations and assess transfer of control.
945983_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	While assessing its performance obligations for sales of security software and software subscriptions that are highly interdependent with support, the Company determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligations with the end customer that are not separately identifiable from the software itself.
945983_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company also determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligation for sales of certain third-party maintenance, support and service contracts.
945983_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	In these instances, under the new guidance, the Company has determined that it does not have control and is acting as an agent in the sale.
945983_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	When acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company accounts for sales on a net basis, with the vendor cost associated with the sale recognized as a reduction of revenue.
945983_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The change from gross sale to net reporting has no impact on gross profit, net income or cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The adoption of the standard is expected to result in a reduction of reported revenue of $288.8 million, $253.5 million and $218.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, had the standard been adopted at the earliest period presented.
945983_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The adoption is not expected to have any impact on income from operations or the Company s balance sheet.
945983_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	For additional information on the expected impact to reported results please see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
945983_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)", ("ASU 2015-11").
945983_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market value represented by replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin.
945983_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
945983_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	We adopted ASU 2015-11 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09").
945983_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement and classification in the statement of cash flows on a prospective basis and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
945983_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards when they occur in determining compensation cost to be recognized each period.
945983_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").
945983_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.
945983_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize for all leases with terms longer than 12 months in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases.
945983_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
945983_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13").
945983_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	ASU No. 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments requiring consideration for a broader range of information in determining timing of when such losses are recorded.
945983_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
945983_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on it consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows ( ASU 2016-15 ) ASU 2016-15 which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted.
945983_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	This amendment is intended to improve accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	In accordance with this guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application.
945983_18_ITEM7_P42_S5	The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting , to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, Stock Compensation .
945983_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met.
945983_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
945983_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	The Company has evaluated the potential impacts of this updated guidance, and it does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
945983_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP.
945983_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update.
945983_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	The company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
945983_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results:
945983_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7%, or $31.2 million, to $449.4 million, compared to $418.1 million for the same period in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Net sales in our Lifeboat distribution segment increased $47.9 million, or 13% to $417.4 million when compared to the prior year, however the increase was offset by decreased extended payment term sales in our TechXtend segment (discussed below).
945983_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in our Lifeboat Distribution segment was primarily due to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
945983_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts due to competitive bid situations.
945983_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We operate in a competitive market in which some sales agreements are subject to periodic competitive bidding processes, resulting in fluctuations from year to year based on the outcome.
945983_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	TechXtend segment net sales decreased $16.7 million or 34% to $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.6 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	The decrease in TechXtend was due primarily to lower large enterprise sales, including those sold under extended payment terms.
945983_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Large enterprise sales tend to fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of customer purchasing decisions for IT projects.
945983_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	The Company s focus on extended payment sales is impacted by such timing, and internal capital allocation decisions.
945983_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	During 2017, as significant amount of our working capital was invested in vendor prepayments and extended payment sales from the fourth quarter of 2016, reducing our emphasis on this business during 2017.
945983_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we relied on two key customers for a total of 42.4% of our revenue.
945983_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	One major customer accounted for 23.0% and the other for 19.4%, of our total net sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.
945983_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	These same customers accounted for 15.1% and 28.6%, of total net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.
945983_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 1% or $0.3 million, to $27.1 million, compared to $27.3 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 4% to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $22.3 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 22% to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.0 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower extended payment terms sales in our TechXtend segment described above and vendor competitive pressures on gross profit margins as discussed below, which were mitigated in part by the impact of increased sales in our Lifeboat segment.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 6.0% compared to 6.5% in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 6.0% in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was caused primarily by competitive pricing pressure and a change in product mix to a higher percentage of our sales being derived from the sale of third party software subscription and maintenance contracts.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Gross profit as a percentage of sales generally is lower on subscription and maintenance contracts than on product sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been for gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales to decline for the past several years and may continue to decline in the future.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	We have instituted operational efficiencies such as electronic ordering and distribution through the use of EDI and other automation that have increased our productivity and enabled us to maintain profitability while selling these services.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S6	TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 12.2%, compared to 10.2% in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S7	The increase in gross profit margin was due to a decrease in larger enterprise and public sector sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P52_S8	Sales of large enterprise licenses and related equipment typically carry a lower gross profit margin as a percent of gross billings, and lower incremental selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue, than smaller account sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Vendor rebates and discounts for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.2 million compared to $2.0 million in the same period last year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors.
945983_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company monitors vendor rebate levels, competitive pricing, and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	We anticipate that price competition in our market will continue in both of our business segments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million, or 3%, to $19.3 million, compared to $18.7 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher employee related and other expenses to support our growth and compliance as a public company.
945983_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.3% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016 .
945983_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring SG A expenses closely.
945983_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.5 million or 40.8% of income before taxes, compared to $3.0 million or 33.9% of income before taxes for 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	The 2017 tax expense includes charges of $0.2 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and transition tax for foreign unrepatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and approximately $0.4 million related to a provision for state taxes for states with economic nexus statutes and other adjustments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to the U.S. income tax law.
945983_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces U.S. statutory tax rates from 34% to 21%.
945983_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Accordingly, we remeasured our deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized.
945983_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.
945983_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.
945983_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which adjustments are made.
945983_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed in 2018.
945983_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 9%, or $36.0 million, to $418.1 million, compared to $382.1 million for the same period in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Net sales increased in both our Lifeboat Distribution segment and our TechXtend segment.
945983_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $29.8 million, or 9%, to $369.5 million, compared to $339.7 million for the same period a year earlier.
945983_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase was primarily due to increased penetration of existing products into new and existing distribution partner accounts, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
945983_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and distribution accounts due to competitive bid situations.
945983_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We operate in a competitive market in which some sales agreements are subject to periodic competitive bidding processes, resulting in fluctuations from year to year based on the outcome.
945983_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	TechXtend segment net sales increased $6.2 million, or 15% to $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $42.4 million for the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	We extend payment terms on some enterprise account sales, typically for periods of one to three years, to provide flexibility for our customers.
945983_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	We reduced our number of sales people late in 2015 to streamline and focus our operations on opportunities with the highest financial return.
945983_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Gross Profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 3%, or $0.8 million, to $27.3 million, compared to $26.6 million for the same period in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 4% to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $21.5 million for the same period in the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	TechXtend segment gross profit remained flat at $5.0 million for each of 2016 and 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	Gross profit amounts reflect increased sales volumes and competitive pressures on gross profit margins discussed below.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 6.5% compared to 7.0% in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 6.3% in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was caused primarily by competitive pricing pressure and product mix.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been for gross profit margins to decline for the past several years.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	We attribute some of the decline to an increasing portion of our revenues coming from the sale of licenses, maintenance and service agreements that are not associated with a physical product.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	While our gross profit margin has declined on these products, we have been able to maintain our profitability through efficiencies gained in electronic ordering and distribution through the use of EDI and other automation.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S6	TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 10.2% compared to 11.9% in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S7	The decrease in gross profit margin was due to competitive market pricing, particularly on larger enterprise sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P66_S8	Sales of large enterprise licenses typically carry a lower gross profit margin, and lower incremental selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue, than smaller account sales.
945983_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Vendor rebates and discounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.0 million.
945983_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors.
945983_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Company monitors vendor rebate levels, competitive pricing, and gross profit margins carefully.
945983_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	We anticipate that price competition in our market will continue in both of our business segments.
945983_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.7 million or 4% to $18.7 million, compared to $18.1 million for the same period in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased stock based compensation and employee related expenses to support our increased sales volume, costs related to the relocation to our new offices in October 2016, and professional expenses related to public company compliance.
945983_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	A expenses were 4.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 4.7% for the same period in 2015.
945983_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company expects that its SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives.
945983_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring our sales and general and administrative expenses closely.

945983_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The use of cash was primarily due to working capital investments to support the growth of our business, and utilization of cash for stock repurchases and dividends.
945983_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The increase in working capital related to increased payment terms for certain accounts and vendor prepayments for inventory purchases.
945983_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.0 million, comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $7.2 million, offset by cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $9.3 million.
945983_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	The increase in cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, and vendor prepayments less accounts payable) required to support our business.
945983_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increased working capital requirement is primarily driven by increased sales levels and extended payment terms sales during the fourth quarter of 2016, and a vendor prepayment of approximately $8.0 million as part of a distribution agreement.
945983_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our accounts receivable long term increased by approximately $4.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a higher level of extended payment term sales.

945983_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The increase in cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2016 was primarily due to increased accounts receivable, inventories and accounts receivable long term, partially offset by increased accounts payable.
945983_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable was primarily due to higher fourth quarter 2016 sales activity when compared to the prior year, increased accounts receivable payment terms for a large reseller customer, and increased sales with extended payment terms.
945983_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 included approximately $9.5 million of accounts receivable related to two extended payment term sales from 2016 that were collected during the first two months of 2017.
945983_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million, compared to $1.0 million in the prior year.
945983_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The decrease was primarily due to capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new office in 2016.
945983_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	In October 2016, the Company moved into a new office, occupying approximately 20,000 square foot facility under a ten year lease with renewal options.

945983_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures , as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of various members of our management, including our Company s President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), and Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer (principal accounting officer).
945983_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, we have identified a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based on the material weakness described below, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The weaknesses we identified relate to several deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of controls over: 1) the application of technical accounting guidance regarding earnings per share calculations which were reported and remediated in the third quarter of 2017, 2) classification of certain balance sheet accounts, 3) management review and monitoring of third-party service providers in regard to state income tax filing requirements and 4) lack of documented policies and procedures with respect to certain intercompany accounts with foreign entities, that in the aggregate constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management performed additional procedures to determine the impact of these issues and determined that any errors resulting from the deficiencies above were immaterial individually and in the aggregate, to the Company s current and previously issued financial statements, however, we concluded that it is appropriate to re-state previously reported amounts for earnings per share using the two-class calculation method when presented on a comparative basis with the current period.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	We ve also concluded that had these errors gone undetected, they could have resulted in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Remediation plan: We have implemented several processes, including those outlined below, to remediate the deficiencies noted above.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	We currently are assessing and improving the operating effectiveness of these controls to ensure they will operate at an acceptable level of assurance.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Hire and train appropriate personnel sufficient to manage the complexity, timing, and ever changing nature of our business and financial reporting requirements.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Retain and evaluate the qualifications and performance of experts who are engaged to assist in the evaluation and adoption of accounting and tax matters where appropriate.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Ensure controls are properly designed to address risks and train key process owners and other relevant personnel to perform timely reconciliations with appropriate documentation and review procedures.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
945983_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Other than what s been disclosed above for our remediation of the material weakness, there have been no additional change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

945983_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and schedule identified in Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
945983_18_ITEM15_P22_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
945983_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework ( 2013 ) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 15, 2018 expressed an adverse opinion.
945983_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
945983_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
945983_18_ITEM15_P24_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
945983_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
945983_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
945983_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
945983_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM15_P26_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM15_P26_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
945983_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	We have audited Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
945983_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework ( 2013 ) issued by COSO.
945983_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
945983_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment.
945983_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company identified several deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of controls which in the aggregate represent a material weakness.
945983_18_ITEM15_P28_S3	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of the audit tests applied in our audit of the December 31, 2017 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 15, 2018 on those financial statements.
945983_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and schedule and our report dated March 15, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion.
945983_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A Controls and Procedures.
945983_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
945983_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

945983_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
945983_18_ITEM15_P31_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

945983_18_ITEM15_P31_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

945983_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
945983_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

945983_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	Earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 has been recalculated and restated using the two-class method and presented on a comparable basis with 2017.
945983_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	In 2017 the Company determined it should be reporting earnings per share using the two-class method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260-10-45-60, which treats unvested restricted shares granted under our 2012 Stock-Based Compensation Plan that are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends as participating securities.
945983_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	While the Company has determined the impact of applying the two-class method does not have a material impact on previously issued financial statements, it is appropriate to recalculate and restate amounts presented on a comparative and consistent basis with current period results.
945983_18_ITEM15_P44_S3	The table below summarizes previously reported and restated amounts on a comparative basis.
945983_18_ITEM15_P44_S4	See footnote 2, Earnings Per Share for more detail on the impact of the two-class method calculation on previously reported earnings per share.

945983_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
945983_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, discount rates applicable to long term receivables, inventory obsolescence, income taxes, depreciation, contingencies and stock-based compensation.
945983_18_ITEM15_P46_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
945983_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	Our basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method.
945983_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The two-class method is an earnings allocation method that determines net income per share for each class of common sto ck and participating securities according to their participation rights in dividends and undistributed earnings or losses.
945983_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	Non-vested restricted stock awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.
945983_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Per share amounts are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period.
945983_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	Diluted and basic earnings per share are the same because the restricted shares are the only potentially dilutive security.
945983_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations follows:

945983_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	We take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks.
945983_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	If actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected, additional allowances may be required.
945983_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience.
945983_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.

945983_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	Accounts receivable-long-term result from product sales with extended payment terms that are discounted to their present values at the prevailing market rates at the time of sale.
945983_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable are increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years.
945983_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	The amounts under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable.
945983_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	Certain reclassifications and immaterial revisions have been made to the prior period financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation.
945983_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income for the period and the impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments.

945983_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	Furthermore, in such drop-ship arrangements, the Company negotiates price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers.
945983_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	Maintenance and subscription agreements allow customers to access software and obtain technical support directly from the software publisher and to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced by the software publisher during the period that the maintenance and subscription agreement is in effect.

945983_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
945983_18_ITEM15_P76_S2	This method also requires a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

945983_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
945983_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.

945983_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	The most significant impact of adopting the standard relates to the determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the sale of third party security software and software that is highly interdependent with support, as well as maintenance, support and other services.
945983_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	Historically, under the transfer of risk and rewards model of revenue recognition, the Company has accounted for primarily all of its sales on a gross basis.
945983_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The new guidance requires the Company to identify performance obligations and assess transfer of control.
945983_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	While assessing its performance obligations for sales of security software and software subscriptions that are highly interdependent with support, the Company determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligations with the end customer that are not separately identifiable from the software itself.
945983_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company also determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligation for sales of certain third-party maintenance, support and service contracts.
945983_18_ITEM15_P84_S2	In these instances, under the new guidance, the Company has determined that it does not have control and is acting as an agent in the sale.
945983_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	When acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company accounts for sales on a net basis, with the vendor cost associated with the sale recognized as a reduction of revenue.
945983_18_ITEM15_P85_S1	The change from gross sale to net reporting has no impact on gross profit, net income or cash flows.
945983_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The adoption of the standard is expected to result in a reduction of reported revenue of $288.8 million, $253.5 million and $218.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
945983_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	The adoption is not expected to have any impact on income from operations or the Company s balance sheet.

945983_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	Software licenses are delivered via electronic license keys provided by the vendor to the end user.

945983_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	Software - security and highly interdependent with support Software - security software and software highly interdependent with support consists of sales of security subscriptions and other products whose functionality is highly interdependent on updates and support services delivered directly by the third-party vendor to the end user.
945983_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	Revenue from our software-security and highly interdependent with support products is recognized on a net basis upon fulfillment to our customers as the Company is not responsible for providing future updates that are critical to the functionality of the software and our performance obligation is complete at the time of delivery.
945983_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	Maintenance, support and other services revenue We generate our maintenance, support and other services revenue primarily from third-party post-contract support arrangements, and, to a lesser extent, from third-party professional services and software as a service subscription.
945983_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	The service period typically commences upon transfer of control of the corresponding products to our customer.
945983_18_ITEM15_P94_S1	Revenue from maintenance, support and other service revenues is recognized on a net basis upon fulfillment to our customers as the Company does not provide the services and our performance obligation is complete at that time.
945983_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	Contracts with multiple performance obligations Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations.
945983_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct.
945983_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices.
