1425565_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our focused customer acquisition approach and our efficiency in converting leads into customers enable us to have what we believe are low customer acquisition costs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	We believe that our Real Goods brand has a national reputation for high quality customer service in the solar energy market, which leads to a significant number of word-of-mouth referrals and new customers.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Solar Living Center in Hopland features interactive demonstrations for renewable energy and environmentally sensible technologies and is the largest facility of its kind, with more than 2.5 million visitors since it opened in 1996.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our History We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to a business that began in 1978 and was privately held until 1991.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our predecessor became Real Goods Trading Corporation, which was publicly traded from 1991 to 2001 when it was acquired by Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	We operated essentially as a separate business (except for certain consolidated corporate functions) from 2001 to 2008, when operations were moved into our corporate entity, Real Goods Solar, Inc., upon its formation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	We acquired Marin Solar in November 2007, Carlson Solar in January 2008, Independent Energy Systems ( IES ) in August 2008, and Regrid Power, Inc. ( Regrid Power ) in October 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our goal is to continue to build on our industry-leading position and be the largest and most profitable residential solar energy integrator in the United States.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P4_S5	We intend to pursue the following strategies to achieve this goal:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Enhance and leverage the Real Goods brand name to increase our market presence .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We intend to enhance and leverage the Real Goods brand name and our reputation for customer service to continue to win business in existing markets and to expand into new markets in which our competitors have little or no brand recognition.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Expand into markets in which legislation and government incentives are favorable for solar energy .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	We plan to expand the geographic scope of our business as jurisdictions adopt new or improve existing incentive programs that enhance the economics of solar energy systems for a broader customer base.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	In addition to the $3.4 billion California Solar Initiative, or CSI, adopted in 2007, a number of states, including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, have adopted legislation and incentives favorable to solar energy and other states are considering adopting such legislation and incentives.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Federal law provides a 30% investment tax credit that was extended for eight years in 2008, when the $2,000 cap on the credit for residential systems was removed.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We believe that this tax credit will continue to stimulate the residential solar market on a national basis.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Consolidate the fragmented U.S. solar energy system installation market .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	The U.S. solar energy system installation market remains highly fragmented, with over 300 independent installers or integrators in California alone.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We intend to continue our consolidation activities in order to penetrate new markets, expand our business and further enhance our national brand and leverage our national marketing programs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	We plan to create economies of scale through our consolidation activities in order to increase our operating efficiencies, with a goal of improving our margins and profitability.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Expand our community of customers to enhance revenue and lower our customer acquisition costs .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to leverage the reputation for authenticity associated with our Real Goods brand to expand our community of customers, which cares deeply about solar energy and a renewable energy lifestyle and views us as the premier provider of products, services and support to enable this lifestyle.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	We plan to cross-market our wide array of energy-saving and carbon footprint-reducing products and services in addition to our solar energy systems, which we believe will enhance our revenue and create additional customer loyalty.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also intend to leverage our customer base to continue to provide us with new leads and referrals, which, in conjunction with our cross-marketing efforts, should allow us to continue to lower our customer acquisition costs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Make a difference in the world .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	We intend to promote our solar energy systems and sustainable living resources as a way for individuals and communities to reduce their carbon footprint, eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign and fossil fuel-based energy sources and foster a culture of respect for the Earth and its natural resources for the benefit of future generations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	Competitive Advantages We believe that we have a number of advantages over our competitors, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe that our customers often buy our solar energy systems because of the strength of the Real Goods brand, our longevity in the marketplace and our reputation for excellent customer service.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	As a result of over 30 years of operating in the solar energy industry, we believe that we are frequently the first company in the industry approached by new solar companies with innovative products.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have a highly experienced management team.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our founder and President, John Schaeffer, has more than 30 years of experience in the solar energy industry.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition, our Chief Financial Officer, Erik Zech, has over 10 years of investment banking experience, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	Also, our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, founded and grew Corporate Express from $30 million to $3 billion in revenue in less than five years, and founded Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	Mr. Rysavy and other members of our management team have considerable experience in the consolidation of fragmented industries, having acquired over 250 companies.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our business model gives us a significant cross-marketing advantage by providing us access to potential purchasers of solar energy systems from visitors to our Solar Living Center and from our strong web presence.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, our strong brand name and reputation for outstanding customer service provide us with word-of-mouth referrals.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that our relationship with Gaiam provides us with additional expertise across brand building, marketing, acquisition completion and integration, and certain administrative functions, enabling us to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We maintain strong relationships with many leading solar PV module manufacturers, including Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower, which provides us with continued access to a supply of our key system components and early review of innovative market products.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our financial strength and market position enable us to purchase directly from these manufacturers which lowers our purchasing costs relative to those of our competitors that are only able to purchase through third-party distributors.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We had $11.1 million of cash and virtually no outstanding debt at December 31, 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We believe that our strong balance sheet and our financial strength meaningfully differentiate us from our competitors, providing our suppliers and customers with confidence in our financial strength and longevity, and further supporting our consolidation strategy.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Industry Overview We believe that as demand for electric power increases, the electric power industry will face various challenges, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Power industry at peak capacity with aging infrastructure .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	A majority of U.S. power plants in highly populated areas approach capacity during times of peak usage.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	Additionally, over half of U.S. power plants are more than 30 years old.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	In order to meet the rising demand for electric power, additional plants will need to be constructed and the aging existing plant infrastructure will require significant capital investment.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Although coal, the largest non-renewable energy resource, is estimated to have over 100 years of reserves left, the rate of global energy consumption is expected to continue to increase, jeopardizing economical access to sufficient energy supply for future generations if renewable energy sources are not developed.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	As a result of aging infrastructure and high energy demand, residential and commercial customers are facing rising electricity rates, creating economic pressures for consumers and businesses alike.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Pollution and climate change concerns .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy sources, including coal, create environmental pollution, and there is significant local resistance to new coal-fired power plants in populated areas.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Concerns about climate change, global warming and greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in international efforts to reduce such emissions, and various states have enacted stricter emissions control laws or mandated that utilities comply with renewable portfolio standards ( RPS ), which require the generation of a certain amount of power from renewable sources.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	We believe that increased concerns about climate change is likely to result in increased focus on alternative energy sources.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	Because the solar energy industry offers solutions to these challenges, we believe it has extremely large growth potential.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Currently, less than one percent of the world s power is generated from solar energy sources.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Drivers of Solar Energy Industry Growth We expect a number of factors will contribute to growth in the solar energy industry, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	A number of initiatives have been enacted by the federal government and various states, municipalities and utilities that encourage or require the installation of grid-tied solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	In 1996, the state of California enabled individual energy systems to tie into the conventional utility grid and began to require that various rebates and incentives be provided to support the use of solar energy systems, making California the focus for the development of the solar energy market in the United States.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	By early 2010, California had over 80,000 installed residential solar energy systems and accounted for approximately two-thirds of the U.S. residential market for solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	California is the largest market in the United States, accounting for more than 50% of total installations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The California Solar Initiative (CSI) provides for the expenditure of up to $3.4 billion in incentives for installation of solar energy systems with generation capacity of 3 GW of electricity by 2017.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	California has also mandated an increase in the percentage of renewable energy retail sales by certain utilities to 20%, with a goal of 33% by 2020.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	Colorado has enacted an RPS goal of 20% for investor-owned utilities and 10% for electric cooperatives and municipal utilities serving more than 40,000 customers by 2020.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	In some jurisdictions, such as Colorado, operation of a solar energy system that is located on the property of a utility customer can satisfy a portion of the utility s RPS requirements.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	As these RPS programs are implemented, it is common for financial incentives to be made available, making the purchase of solar energy systems more affordable and opening additional solar markets in the United States.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Rebates offered to customers or integrators reduce the initial cost of solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Several states, including California and Colorado, require certain utilities to offer rebates that can substantially reduce the costs of installing solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	California s residential rebate is currently $0.35 to $1.10 per watt.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	Colorado s largest utility currently offer a total effective rebate of $2.01 per watt; however, in February 2011, this utility filed a petition that, if approved, would further drop the effective rebate to $1.25 per watt.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	These rebates, coupled with tax credits, substantially reduce the customer s out-of-pocket cost for purchasing a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	There is currently a 30% federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar energy systems, and in October 2008 Congress extended the availability of this credit for both residential and commercial solar installations for another eight years and eliminated the $2,000 cap on the tax credit for residential installations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Other incentives, such as net metering, time-of-use credits and performance-based incentives, are provided to consumers based on the amount of electricity their solar energy systems generate.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Currently, over three quarters of the states have required some of their utility providers to accept net metering.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Net metering allows residential and small-scale commercial solar energy producers to sell excess power generated by their systems to their utility companies, through existing electric meters, at standard retail prices.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Time-of-use metering allows customers to sell solar power to their utility for higher rates during peak times when traditional loads are at their highest demand.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	These customers can then buy back electricity from the utilities during off-peak times at a much lower rate, providing them an additional financial benefit for solar installations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Performance-based incentives, or PBIs, reward customers based on the generation of their solar energy over time, as opposed to through an initial rebate.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The CSI currently requires that residential customers who choose not to accept the purchase rebate be provided a PBI of $0.05 to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour for a period of five years.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	This PBI amount declines in steps as the aggregate number of residential solar energy systems increases.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	In many states, the installation of a solar energy system generates a renewable energy credit, or REC, which is marketable in certain states.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	For the states that we currently operate in, these RECs are of little value in the hands of individual solar energy system owners because of the limited market for RECs and the associated transaction costs, which are high relative to the value of RECs typically available to an individual residential user.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	In some cases, we will retain the RECs that result from our integration projects, and we expect additional revenues may be generated from the sale of these aggregated RECs in the future if a market for RECs develops.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	In certain jurisdictions, such as California, assessors are prohibited from increasing a solar energy system owner s property tax assessment as a result of the added value of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Benefits of solar energy systems .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Solar energy as a source of electrical power offers the following benefits compared to conventional energy sources:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The cost of electricity generated by a solar energy system is essentially fixed at the time of installation, providing a hedge against utility electricity price increases and inflation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Solar energy systems generate much of their electricity during the afternoon when the sun s rays are strongest and when the greatest demand for electricity for air conditioning occurs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Customers can use their solar energy systems energy to replace peak time conventional electricity, which can be more expensive and less reliable than electricity purchased during non-peak times.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, solar energy systems typically have low operating expenses because the systems require minimal maintenance over their expected lives.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Versatility and ease of installation .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Solar energy systems can generate electricity in any location that receives sunlight, while relatively fewer locations have both the infrastructure and natural resources required to support other forms of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind and geothermal.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Solar energy systems can be installed directly at sites where power is needed, reducing conventional electrical transmission and distribution costs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The use of solar energy systems improves energy security by reducing fossil fuel purchases from hostile or politically or economically unstable countries and by reducing power strains on local electrical transmission and distribution systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Challenges to the Solar Energy Industry We believe growth in the solar energy industry faces the following challenges:
1425565_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The decision to install a solar energy system represents a significant investment of approximately $10,000 to $30,000 or more (net of rebates and federal tax credits), if purchased outright, for the typical home.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	Financing sources specifically for solar energy systems, including loans and system leases, are not always available depending upon the state and the customer s credit rating.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	The return on each customer s investment in a solar energy system will occur over a different period or at a different rate depending upon individual circumstances.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	A potential purchaser has to weigh the initial investment decision against the longer-term utility cost reductions, increased property value and low system maintenance costs provided by a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The solar energy industry is significantly driven by federal, state and local regulations and incentives, which are continually changing.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	Changes in regulations and incentives could adversely affect the economic viability of solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Supply of solar PV modules .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	At times in recent years, there has been a global shortage of solar PV modules, which has resulted in some price increases and limited availability for solar PV modules.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	While we believe that the risk of future shortages has lessened, it is always a possibility.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Cost of traditional energy sources .
1425565_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The cost of solar power generation is often compared by customers to the cost of traditional sources of electricity generation such as coal.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Traditional power plants are relatively cheap to build but expensive to operate when the true price of their environmental impact is considered.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	Solar power plants are more expensive to build but cheaper to operate over the long-term, with minimal environmental impact.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	The growth of the solar power industry is dependent on how consumers weigh the relative importance of construction costs relative to the operating costs for both types of electricity production and the extent to which government mandates require traditional power plants to incorporate environmental costs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The recent recession has created a challenging business climate for the purchase of solar systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	We believe that many customers remain interested in solar but are electing to postpone their decision to install a system until they have better visibility into the economy and their own personal financial situation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	We install residential and commercial systems that are generally between 3 kW and 500 kW output, with the average residential installation being approximately 5 kW output.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects of up to 3MW output.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S5	We design and build our solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S6	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average daily consumption rates in different seasons of the year to size the solar energy system and engineer its wiring.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S7	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar PV modules.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S8	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory and its rate structures and the customer s budget and preferred financing method, as well as the customer s aesthetic preferences.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S9	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, that are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates and various other factors.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S10	We assess this data using solar monitoring tools and analytical calculations, which enable us to design a solar energy system to a size and configuration that maximizes energy efficiency for each customer s circumstances.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S11	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit which is necessary for rebate processing.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P47_S12	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis and determine the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	As soon as the building permit is approved, our installation professionals begin the installation by placing metal racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the solar PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	We do not custom manufacture solar PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	After the solar PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction and at the same time apply for the local utility company to interconnect the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	The entire process from signing of the contract through final inspection by the local building department typically takes between 60 to 90 days, with the actual installation work usually requiring two to three days.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	A basic solar energy system has no moving parts and consists of a number of solar PV modules wired together and mounted on a metal framing structure, an inverter and the balance of systems and safety equipment necessary to connect the system to the customer s existing utility service.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	We source solar PV modules from several primary manufacturers: Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	These modules range in conversion efficiency from 12% to 19%.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Solar PV modules can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono- and poly-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide, or CIGS, and cadmium telluride.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Developments in solar PV technology have generated advances in the conversion efficiency of solar PV cells, reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in manufacturing yields.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	An inverter is an electronic device that converts the low-voltage DC power generated by solar PV modules to conventional 120-volt AC power used by standard household lights and appliances.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	While an inverter may need to be replaced approximately 15 years after installation, other system components typically do not require replacement during the 20- to 25-year warranty period applicable to solar PV modules.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Individual solar energy systems are connected to the utility grid by an inverter, which also allows the excess electricity produced to flow into the grid, causing the customer s electric meter effectively to run backwards, to the credit of the customer s utility account, sometimes at standard retail prices.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	A customer that has a grid-connected solar energy system draws energy from the grid through the conventional local utility when the sun is not shining, or when household energy consumption exceeds the solar energy system s energy generation capacity.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Warranty Terms Most manufacturers of solar PV modules currently offer a 20- to 25-year transferable warranty of their products.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	We offer a 10-year parts and labor warranty, which may also involve claims of property damage arising from the installation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	We generally handle manufacturer warranty claims for solar PV modules as part of our customer service and we are typically reimbursed by the manufacturers for our labor and materials.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S3	Historically, our costs associated with warranty claims have been minimal.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S4	Financing While many of our customers choose to purchase their solar energy systems without the use of financing, we also connect our customers with preferred third-party financing sources.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S5	We also work with solar financiers who lease solar systems to our customers over 10 to 20 year periods.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S6	We handle some of the administrative processing for our customers that choose to use third-party financing or leasing.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P55_S7	Loss of preferred third-party financing and leasing sources for our customers could adversely affect our business as it would reduce funding alternatives available to homeowners seeking to install a solar system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Sales and Marketing Our conventional marketing program includes presentation booths at tradeshows and consumer shows, Internet search engine optimization, pay-per-click ad words, Internet banner advertisements, affiliate marketing programs, community involvement initiatives and customer referral programs.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	To enhance our solar energy integration business by generating leads of potential solar energy system customers and promoting our brand awareness, we operate our Solar Living Center and maintain a robust website.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our website provides pricing tools, media programming, in-depth articles and product information, and how-to instructional content.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	These products include solar PV modules, inverters, books and DVDs on renewable energy and sustainable living, products for solar and other water heating, green building products and systems, air purification products and water conservation and purification products.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S4	We believe that certain of these channels provide a significant cross-marketing advantage by providing us access to a highly targeted group of potential customers who have likely purchased other renewable energy and sustainable living products and resources in the past.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S5	We also receive new customer leads from the referrals of our satisfied customers, through our customer rewards and affinity programs, from designers and architects with whom we have worked on previous projects, and through the strength and longevity of our Real Goods brand name and reputation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S6	We believe that these attractive sources of leads lower our customer acquisition costs to below what we estimate they would be if we were to rely solely on traditional marketing methods such as print, radio, television and Internet search words.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S7	After we receive these high-quality leads, our inside sales representatives conduct an extensive telephone interview of the potential customer during which we determine, among other things, information about the customer s site, location, and solar exposure, and that the customer and any relevant family member or co-owner is genuinely interested in and able to finance the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S8	We use this focused customer qualification process to identify which potential customers are most likely to respond positively to our direct sales efforts before we make a site visit to the customer s location.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S9	We then utilize our direct sales force to pursue these qualified leads.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P56_S10	This qualification process further lowers our customer acquisition costs because it narrows our customer leads and allows us to focus our direct sales efforts on highly targeted customers.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	We own the Real Goods Solar Living Center, which is located on a 12-acre campus in Hopland, California, approximately 95 miles north of San Francisco.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	The Solar Living Center is a demonstration site for the technology and culture of solar living and serves as a very effective source of qualified leads for solar installations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	In 2010, the Solar Living Center had over 120,000 visitors.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	Since it opened in 1996, more than 2.5 million people have visited the Solar Living Center, and it has become one of the largest tourist attractions in Northern California throughout the year.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Customers Our residential customers have historically shared a number of characteristics.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	They tend to be college-educated homeowners, 30 to 65 years in age, high-income earners who are generally motivated both by environmental and economic reasons to install a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our residential solar energy systems are generally 10kW or smaller in size, and our commercial solar energy systems are generally no larger than 500 kW in size.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our typical residential customer is connected to the utility grid.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our commercial customers have included wineries, schools, apartment buildings, low income housing communities, churches and retail facilities.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Suppliers We do not manufacture solar PV modules, inverters or other components used in our solar energy systems, but purchase those components directly from manufacturers or, in some cases, from third-party distributors.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	We purchase solar PV modules manufactured by Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S4	We purchase inverters manufactured by SMA, Enphase and others.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S5	We currently purchase the components used in our solar energy systems on a purchase order basis from a select group of manufacturers or suppliers.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S6	If we are unable to purchase from any of these sources in the future, we do not believe we would have difficulty in securing alternative supply sources, because all of the components we use in our solar energy systems are available from a number of different sources.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P60_S7	With that said, the world-wide market for solar PV modules has from time to time experienced shortages of supply that have increased prices and affected availability.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The solar energy industry is in its early stages of development and is highly fragmented, consisting of many small, privately held companies with limited resources and operating histories but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or low overhead requirements.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	A number of competitors exist in the California market, including companies such as REC Solar and Solar City.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	Several of our competitors have expanded their market share in the California market by opening multiple offices within the state.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	We estimate that we are currently in the top two residential solar energy system installers in California.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S4	In Colorado our competitors include Namaste Solar Electric, REC Solar and Solar City, but we are not aware of published data regarding competitive positions in Colorado.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P61_S5	We compete on factors such as brand recognition, quality of services and products, pricing, speed and quality of installation.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Regulations Solar integrator services are subject to oversight and regulation by national and local ordinances, including building, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection regulations, utility interconnection requirements for metering and other rules and regulations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our design and engineering teams design and install solar energy systems to comply with these varying standards as well as to minimize the installation and operating costs of each system.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our operations are also subject to generally applicable laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into the environment and protection of the environment; however, because our operations do not typically involve any such discharge, there are no material effects on our business relating to our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	Our tradenames are Real Goods , which was last renewed in 2004, and Real Goods Solar, which is pending a trademark application.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S4	We believe these trademarks are significant assets to our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S5	The Real Goods trademark registration is valid for ten years and we endeavor to maintain such registrations as valid and current by filing all required renewal forms when due.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P62_S6	In addition, we hold the copyright for most of the contents of the Solar Living Sourcebook.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather in certain geographic regions.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	Much of the seasonality in the business in previous quarters has been offset by changes in government activities as well as strong organic growth.
1425565_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	As of February 4, 2011, we had approximately 263 full-time and 7 part-time employees, including installation personnel.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Government subsidies are an important economic factor in the determination to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Certain states, including California and Colorado, and certain localities and utilities offer incentives to offset a portion of the cost of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These incentives can take many forms, including direct rebates, state tax credits, system performance payments and renewable energy credits, or RECs.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The reduction or elimination of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Adverse general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Adverse overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, business conditions, stock market volatility, weather conditions, acts of terrorism, threats of war, and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	If the economic conditions continue to be adverse or worsen, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development, and the extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to grow our business at the rate we desire.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S11	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A drop in the retail price of conventional energy or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional energy, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Inexpensive prices for oil and other fossil fuels and electricity could also have a negative effect on our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date about these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Existing regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For example, metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that could deter purchases of solar energy systems and investment in the research and development of solar energy technology.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Without a mandated regulatory exception for solar energy systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Such fees could increase the cost to our customers of using solar energy systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Changes in net metering policies could also deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rates rather than with the less expensive average price of electricity.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate, would require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant market share.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We derive all of the revenue from our solar energy integration services from sales in two states.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from solar energy integration services from projects in California and Colorado.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This geographic concentration exposes us to growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in California and Colorado and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our success may depend in part on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S6	As part of our business strategy, we plan to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions in our current markets and in new geographic markets.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We acquired several businesses over the last few years.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These risks, as well as other circumstances that often accompany expansion through acquisitions, could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, the size, timing and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Consequently, our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our failure to integrate the operations of acquired businesses successfully into our operations or to manage our anticipated growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	In order to pursue a successful acquisition strategy, we must integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that leverage our revenue and growth opportunities.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S7	The integration of the management, operations, and facilities of acquired businesses with our own could involve difficulties, which could adversely affect our growth rate and operating results.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We may be unable to complete effectively the integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; to manage efficiently the combined operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; to achieve our operating, growth and performance goals for acquired businesses; to achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or to achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our rate of growth and operating performance may suffer if we fail to manage acquired businesses profitably without substantial additional costs or operational problems or to implement effectively combined growth and operating strategies.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs and the size, timing and structure of future acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Any borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on future borrowings.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S13	If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S14	In addition, our operations may not generate sufficient cash for our acquisition plans.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S15	The extent to which we would be able or willing to use our equity to consummate future acquisitions will depend on the market price of our equity from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept our equity as full or partial payment.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S16	Using our equity for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our shareholders.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S17	To the extent that we are unable to use our equity to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose through debt or equity financings.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S18	The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S19	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S20	The expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources, particularly given our current reliance on our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, who also is the Chairman of Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S21	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S22	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P12_S23	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our success depends on the value of our Real Goods brand.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We depend on the name recognition of our Real Goods brand in our marketing efforts.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Maintaining and building recognition of our brand are important to expanding our customer base.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If the value of our brand were adversely affected, our ability to attract customers would be negatively impacted and our growth could be impaired.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We rely on third-party suppliers for components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	During 2010, Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower accounted for over 80% of our purchases of solar PV modules; and SMA and Enphase accounted for over 90% of our purchases of inverters.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The failure of our suppliers to supply us with components in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules and harm our operating results and business expansion efforts.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our orders with certain of our suppliers may represent a very small portion of their total business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	As a result, these suppliers may not give priority to our business, leading to potential delays in or cancellation of our orders.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If any of our suppliers were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Shortages in the supply of silicon could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Shortages of silicon could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules we use in our solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Manufacturers of solar PV modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar PV modules.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Shortages of silicon cause the prices for solar PV modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar PV modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of market share or reduced margins.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and fragmented with low barriers to entry.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We currently compete with a large number of relatively small installers and integrators, some of which do not have extensive industry experience and may lack adequate systems and capital, but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As the solar energy industry expands and industry consolidation occurs, we are more likely to encounter competition from larger companies, some of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a 10-year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P20_S8	In addition, most manufacturers of solar PV modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims and we have not had material warranty claims in the past, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial condition.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Given our emphasis on customer service, the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order-processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our catalog and Internet business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	To maintain a high level of customer service, we rely on a number of third-party service providers, such as delivery companies, telecommunications companies and printers.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any interruption in services from our principal third-party service providers, including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes, power outages, human error, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, could materially and adversely affect our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, products that we source overseas must be shipped to our distribution center by freight carriers, and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S8	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P22_S10	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Accordingly, shareholders would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Risk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam Gaiam controls Real Goods, and Gaiam s interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Gaiam holds approximately 55% of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock, consisting of 7,846,707 shares of our Class A common stock and 2,153,293 shares of our Class B common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The holders of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock have substantially similar rights, preferences, and privileges except with respect to voting and conversion rights and other protective provisions.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Each share of Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of Class A common stock has one vote per share.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into one share of Class A common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S8	In addition, if Gaiam transfers shares of our Class B common stock, it must elect whether or not to transfer the shares as Class B common stock or convert those shares into Class A common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P24_S9	The Class A common stock is not convertible.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Gaiam s shares are entitled to cast approximately 64% of the votes our shareholders are entitled to cast.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Because of Gaiam s voting control of our stock, Gaiam will be able to exert substantial influence over our company and control matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares available for issuance under our Incentive Plan.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock, subject only to the approval of holders of our Class B common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As a result of Gaiam s control, no change of control of our company can occur without Gaiam s consent.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, who is also the Chairman of Gaiam, currently owns approximately 27% of the outstanding equity, and in excess of 50% of the voting power, of Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Gaiam s and Mr. Rysavy s voting control may discourage transactions involving a change of control of our company, including transactions in which a holder of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for our shares over the then current market price.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Gaiam is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Gaiam did not maintain voting control over us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our historical financial information for periods prior to our initial public offering do not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented or will be in the future.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we or Gaiam terminate our intercorporate services agreement, or if we are unable to establish on a cost-effective basis our own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a stand-alone company after the expiration or termination of our intercorporate services agreement with Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S7	In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into an intercorporate services agreement to retain the ability for specified periods to use certain Gaiam resources.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S8	This agreement automatically renews on a quarterly basis.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Any decision by us to terminate this agreement would be approved by disinterested members of our management and board of directors under our procedures regarding related party transactions.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S10	In connection with the expiration or termination of this agreement, we will need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace Gaiam s services.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S11	These services may not be provided at the same level as when we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Gaiam, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits that we received prior to the separation.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S12	These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and after our agreement with Gaiam expires or is terminated, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at prices and on terms as favorable as we currently have with Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S13	Any failure or significant downtime in our own administrative systems or in Gaiam s administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs, impact our results or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on a timely basis.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S14	Our inability to resolve any disputes that arise between us and Gaiam with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may result in a reduction of our revenue, and such disputes may also result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P26_S15	Disputes may arise between Gaiam and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including the following:
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	business opportunities that may be attractive to both Gaiam and us.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, we have indemnification obligations under the tax, intercorporate services and registration rights agreements with Gaiam, and disputes between us and Gaiam may result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, we do not currently expect that these indemnification obligations will materially affect our potential liability compared to what it would be if we did not enter into these agreements with Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Some of our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Gaiam common stock, options to acquire Gaiam common stock and positions with Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Some of our directors and executive officers own Gaiam common stock and options to purchase Gaiam common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, a majority of our directors are also directors and/or executive officers of Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Ownership of Gaiam common stock and options to purchase Gaiam common stock by our directors and officers and the presence of directors and executive officers of Gaiam on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	For example, corporate opportunities may arise that are applicable or complementary to both of our businesses and that each business would be free to pursue, such as the potential acquisition of a particular business or technology focused on environmental sustainability including renewable energy sources, energy efficiency or energy use reduction.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	However, we understand that Gaiam does not intend to acquire businesses that are focused on solar energy.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We have not established at this time any procedural mechanisms to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest of these directors and officers and expect that our board of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, will determine how to address any actual or perceived conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S7	If any corporate opportunity arises and if our directors and officers do not pursue it on our behalf, we may not become aware of, and may potentially lose, a significant business opportunity.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Possible future sales of shares by Gaiam could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S9	Gaiam may sell any or all of the shares of common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Under a registration rights agreement between us and Gaiam, Gaiam has the right to require us to register the shares of Class A common stock it owns and the shares it may acquire upon conversion of its shares of Class B common stock to facilitate the possible sale of such shares.
1425565_11_ITEM1A_P28_S11	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Gaiam would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.
1425565_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Hopland, California, which includes offices, our retail store, and the Solar Living Center.
1425565_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We sublease office space from Gaiam in Louisville, Colorado, from which we manage our web business and certain management and customer service functions.
1425565_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also lease office and warehouse facilities in San Rafael, California; Murrieta, California; Santa Cruz, California; Campbell, California; and Fresno, California; and warehouse facilities in Denver, Colorado; Cloverdale, California; and Fullerton, California.
1425565_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Stock Price History Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol RSOL .
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 7, 2011, we had 13 shareholders of record and 16,157,339 shares of $.0001 par value Class A common stock outstanding.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	We have 2,153,293 shares of $.0001 par value Class B common stock outstanding, held by one shareholder.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S3	The following table sets forth certain sales price and trading volume data for our Class A common stock for the periods indicated: Dividend Policy We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S4	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S5	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_11_ITEM5_P0_S6	The following table summarizes equity compensation plan information for our Class A common stock:
1425565_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	You should read the following selected consolidated financial data together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 from our audited financial statements, which are not included in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial data for 2008 includes the effects of our acquisitions from the date of the transaction.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P0_S2	Our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Gaiam expenses, including costs of fulfillment, customer service, financial and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P0_S3	The expense allocations are based on what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	Income tax expenses were calculated on the separate return approach.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	The historical financial data in our audited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows will be in the future, or, with respect to periods prior to our initial public offering, what such results would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	(a) Net income per share for 2007 and 2006 is calculated as if Gaiam transferred our business assets and operations to us in return for 10,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock on January 1, 2006.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	We did not exist as a separate company during those two years.
1425565_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	We computed earnings per share based on the shares outstanding following this contribution as if such shares were outstanding from the beginning of the periods presented.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K. Overview We are a leading residential and commercial solar energy integrator.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	We install residential and small commercial systems that are generally between 3 kW and 500 kW output, with the average residential installation being approximately 5 kW output.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects of up to 3MW output.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our revenues primarily result from the installation of solar energy systems.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	We also derive a portion of our revenues from the retail sale of renewable energy products.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	Our expenses primarily consist of labor costs incurred in connection with solar installations, product costs for solar photovoltaic modules and other products sold, and related office and warehouse costs.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	2010 was a record year for us.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We grew revenues through marketing and sales initiatives, while at the same time holding expenses roughly constant by realizing significant cost savings through integration of previously acquired businesses onto a single set of systems and a unified brand.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	As a result, we returned to profitability during 2010 and posted record revenue and net income.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	We were also able to increase our gross profit margin in 2010 due to improved selling and installation practices, as well as continued declines in PV module prices.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	As we enter 2011, we anticipate continuing to build on our 2010 initiatives by expanding marketing and sales efforts to further leverage our solar installation capabilities.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	We continue to expect strong demand for both residential and commercial solar installations despite the overall economic weakness in the U.S. Mergers and Acquisitions Marin Solar, Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S6	On November 1, 2007, we purchased 100% ownership of Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S7	As additional consideration we granted to the sellers warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S8	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P2_S9	The warrants have a seven year term.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	On January 1, 2008, our 88.4% owned subsidiary acquired certain of the assets of and assumed certain liabilities from Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	As part of the acquisition, as additional consideration, we granted warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	The warrants have a seven year term.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The assets acquired were determined to have all inputs and processes necessary for the transferred assets to continue to conduct normal operations after acquisition; accordingly, the purchase price was treated as a business combination.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	we exchanged 280,000 shares of our Class A common stock for our current Chief Financial Officer s 11.6% ownership in Real Goods Carlson Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	On August 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of IES for $3.3 million in cash and $0.3 million worth of our Class A common stock, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	On October 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Regrid Power through a merger into one of our subsidiaries, for an aggregate of $3.8 million in cash and 2,047,256 shares of our Class A common stock, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, subject to post closing adjustments, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.3 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	During 2009, as purchase price true-up and contingent consideration related to this acquisition, we issued 163,504 shares and 200,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock with an estimated combined fair value of $0.7 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees and sales of renewable and sustainable energy products.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the solar energy system installation.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We recognize revenue from solar energy system installations of less than 110 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from solar energy system installations equal to or greater than 110 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	We recognize revenue from the sale of renewable and sustainable energy products when the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Product Returns We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness, and current economic trends.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the enterprise level.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The annual process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	impairment, we use a combination of factors, including comparable company market values and multiples of revenue to the extent the information is available.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	If comparable market information is insufficient, we expect to supplement our assessment with other approaches, such as present value techniques, which will require us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Application of alternative assumptions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, independent expert appraisals.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	In calculating this fair value, there are certain highly subjective assumptions that we use, as disclosed in note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, consisting of estimated market value of our stock, the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and volatility.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not recognize share-based compensation expense unless the vesting of performance condition options is probable.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Prior to our initial public offering, we determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant of stock awards based on the combination of two factors: an independent offer to purchase a portion of us in exchange for preferred stock and the value of recent acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Income Taxes For financial reporting purposes, income tax expense and deferred income tax balances are calculated as if we were a separate entity and had prepared our own separate tax return during all applicable periods.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the FASB s guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Under the FASB s guidance, we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net revenue.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Net revenue increased $13.0 million, or 20.2%, to $77.3 million during 2010 from $64.3 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	All the revenue growth was organic and was primarily driven by an increase in marketing and sales initiatives.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	Gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 34.8%, to $21.5 million during 2010 from $16.0 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit increased to 27.8% during 2010 from 24.8% during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	The increase in gross profit percentage is approximately two-thirds due to declines in solar module prices over the last year and from improved selling and installation practices.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	No further significant changes to the gross profit margin are anticipated.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S7	Selling and operating expenses increased $0.5 million, or 3.1%, to $16.7 million during 2010 from $16.2 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P21_S8	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses decreased to 21.6% during 2010 from 25.2% during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	previously acquired businesses onto a single set of systems and a unified brand.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Further leveraging of the selling and operating expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, is expected as sales continue to grow.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	General and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 18.5%, to $2.8 million during 2010 from $2.3 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses remained consistent at 3.6% during each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	As a result of the above factors, net income was $1.2 million during 2010 compared to a net loss of $1.6 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	Net income per share was $0.07 per share during 2010 compared to a net loss of $0.09 per share during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net revenue .
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S7	Net revenue increased $25.1 million, or 64.0%, to $64.3 million during 2009 from $39.2 million during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S8	The increase in net revenue is approximately 43% the result of organic growth, with the remainder due to our acquisitions during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S9	Gross profit increased $5.5 million, or 52.8%, to $16.0 million during 2009 from $10.4 million during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S10	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 24.8% during 2009 from 26.6% during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P22_S11	The decrease in gross profit percentage is approximately three-quarters the result of an increased mix of lower margin commercial installations, with most of the remaining increase resulting from the inclusion of acquired businesses which have traditionally produced lower gross profit margins.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Selling and operating expenses increased $3.7 million, or 29.4%, to $16.2 million during 2009 from $12.5 million during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses decreased to 25.2% during 2009 from 31.9% during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The increase in selling and operating expenses primarily reflects the support of our revenue growth.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The decrease in the selling and operating expenses percentage is approximately one-third due to a reduction in work force in early 2009 and approximately one-quarter due to other cost cutting measures, with most of the remaining decrease resulting from the leveraging of costs.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	General and administrative expenses increased $0.8 million, or 53.4%, to $2.3 million during 2009 from $1.5 million during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	As of percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 3.6% during 2009 from 3.9% during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P23_S6	The increase in general and administrative expenses is approximately one-half due to a full year of incremental public company costs, with most of the remaining increase resulting from significant infrastructure expansion to support our 2008 acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net loss attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a result of the above factors, net loss attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. was $1.6 million during 2009 compared to $28.0 million during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Net loss per share attributable to our common shareholders was $0.09 per share compared to $1.86 per share during 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, net of tax, of $25.9 million, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations during each of the quarters in 2010 and 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	We believe this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the quarters presented.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	This financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have in the past and may in the future fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, the timing of contracts, and other factors.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	With regards to our renewable and sustainable energy products sold through catalogs and the Internet, sales tend to peak during the spring and end of year holiday seasons.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital needs arise from working capital required to fund our purchases of solar PV modules and inverters, capital related to acquisitions of new businesses, development of renewable energy products, replacements, expansions and improvements to our infrastructure, and future growth.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	These capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including business acquisitions, the ability to attract new solar energy system installation customers, market acceptance of our product offerings, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product offerings, the level of expenditures for sales and marketing, the level of investment in support systems and facilities and other factors.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and cannot accurately be predicted.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2010, and we do not presently have any plans for future material capital expenditures.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	During 2007 and 2008, we acquired four solar energy system installation businesses.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	We plan to continue to pursue business acquisition and other opportunities to expand our sales territories, technologies, and products and increase our sales and marketing programs as needed.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of cash during the periods presented: Operating activities .
1425565_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our operating activities used net cash of $0.3 million during 2010 and provided net cash of $0.2 million during 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Our net cash used by operating activities during 2010 was primarily attributable to increased accounts receivable of $5.3 million and inventory of $1.6 million, partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and payable to Gaiam of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, net income of $1.2 million, noncash adjustments to our net income of $1.1 million, decreased deferred costs on uncompleted contract and advertising of $0.9 million, increased deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts of $0.5 million, and decreased other current assets of $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Our net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was primarily attributable to decreased inventory of $4.4 million and income taxes receivable of $0.2 million, increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.7 million, and increased payable to Gaiam of $0.5 million, partially offset by increased accounts receivable of $6.3 million, net loss of $1.6 million, and non-cash adjustments to our net loss and decrease deferred revenue of $0.4 million each.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our investing activities used net cash of $0.8 million and $0.3 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Our cash used in investing activities during both 2010 and 2009 was used to acquire property and equipment.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	We believe our available cash (which was approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2010) and cash expected to be generated from operations should be sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	However, our projected cash needs may change as a result of possible acquisitions, unforeseen operational difficulties, or other factors.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	If required by our liquidity needs, we believe that we could obtain debt financing that would assist us in meeting any unanticipated cash requirements.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	In particular, our current assets (other than the cash balance referred to above) significantly exceed our current liabilities.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P31_S6	In addition, to the extent debt financing was unavailable or if we elected not to proceed with debt financing, we may also consider equity financing to meet any unanticipated cash requirements.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In the normal course of our business, we investigate, evaluate and discuss acquisition, joint venture, noncontrolling investment, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the solar energy markets.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	For any future investment, acquisition, or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing equity securities, or incurring additional indebtedness.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	We have commitments under operating leases and various service agreements with Gaiam (see Note 10 to our notes to consolidated financial statements), but do not have any outstanding commitments under long-term debt obligations or purchase obligations.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	The following table shows our commitments to make future payments under our operating leases: To the extent we become entitled to utilize certain pre-initial public offering loss carryforwards from our separate tax returns, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, May 13, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	These net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2018 if not utilized.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	As of December 31, 2010, $5.0 million of these net operating loss carryforwards are available for utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.7 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	Based upon our estimated utilization of some of these loss carryforwards on our 2010 tax returns, as of December 31, 2010 we recorded a payable to Gaiam of $0.5 million, which is subject to adjustment based on our final income tax return for 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase a significant amount of renewable energy and organic product inventory from vendors outside of the United States in transactions that are primarily U.S. dollar denominated transactions.
1425565_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Since the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is small, any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us.
1425565_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, a decline in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies could lead to increased purchasing costs.
1425565_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In order to mitigate this exposure, we make virtually all of our purchase commitments in U.S. dollars.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Louisville, Colorado We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.

1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1425565_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	Principles of Consolidation, Organization and Nature of Operations We are a leading residential solar energy integrator.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	We were incorporated in Colorado on January 29, 2008 under the name Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( Real Goods , we , us , or our ).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we were 54.6% owned by Gaiam, Inc. ( Gaiam ).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our initial public offering of common stock occurred on May 7, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P7_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements represent the solar energy business of Gaiam and its subsidiaries as though the transfer of such business and the related net assets occurred on January 1, 2006.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Until our initial public offering, we were not operating as a separate business within Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements prior to our initial public offering have been prepared on a carve-out basis.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	The carve-out consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P8_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Gaiam expenses, including costs of fulfillment, customer service, financial, and other administrative services.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P8_S4	The expense allocations have been determined on bases that Gaiam and we consider to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Real Goods and its majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and they include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Noncontrolling interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the noncontrolling holders percentage share of income or losses from the subsidiaries in which we hold a majority, but less than 100 percent, ownership interest and consolidate the subsidiaries results in our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	We have included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P10_S2	No changes were made to our significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P10_S3	We have evaluated events subsequent to December 31, 2010 and concluded that no material event has occurred which either would impact the results reflected in this report or our results going forward.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposit accounts with financial institutions and highly liquid investments, which mature within three months of date of purchase.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	The fair value of the cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of their short maturities.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	Concentration of Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have a potential concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable in that a financing company who purchases and then leases installed solar energy system to host users, one other large customer, and two public utility companies who fund rebates accounted for 24.0%, 20.1%, and 9.0%, respectively, of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S3	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S4	We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S5	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S6	If the financial condition of our customers or the public utilities or financing companies were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S7	Sales to our largest two customers for 2010 accounted for approximately 32.8% and 21.8%, respectively, of our total net revenue.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S8	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at our various warehouses and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S9	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S10	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S11	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P11_S12	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we estimated obsolete or slow-moving inventory to be $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Gaiam has historically fulfilled approximately 80% of our catalog and Internet sales through its central distribution center.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	We pay Gaiam supplier product costs, order fulfillment fees, and freight charges to drop-ship these sales to our customers, which payments are made through our intercorporate services agreement.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	be offered and set the sales price.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	We are responsible for the selling, marketing, and providing of these products to our customers and have our own customer service department to ensure the acceptability of our products.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	We bear the credit risk for the amount being billed to our customer.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P13_S3	We leverage our multichannel distribution (web promotions and our retail outlet located at the Solar Living Center) to market slow-moving or obsolete products.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Deferred Advertising Costs Deferred advertising costs relate to the preparation, printing, advertising and distribution of catalogs.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	We defer such costs for financial reporting purposes until the catalogs are distributed, then amortize such costs over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated direct relationship sales.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	We amortize seasonal catalogs within seven months and our annual catalogs within one year.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P14_S3	Forecasted sales statistics are the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	We expense other advertising and promotional costs as incurred.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Amounts recorded as advertising expense were $2.2 million, $2.3 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in selling and operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	We compute depreciation of property and equipment on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	We amortize leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	We compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the enterprise level.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The annual process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	In assessing our goodwill for impairment, we use a combination of factors, including comparable company market values and multiples of revenue to the extent the information is available.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	If comparable market information is insufficient, we expect to supplement our assessment with other approaches, such as present value techniques, which will require us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P19_S3	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P19_S4	Application of alternative assumptions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Our goodwill balance as of December 31, 2010 was $0.7 million and has not changed over the last two years.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, reports of independent experts.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of solar energy system installation contract fees and sales of renewable and sustainable energy products.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed contract or percentage-of-completion method, based on the energy size of the solar energy system installation project.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	We recognize revenue from solar energy system installations of less than 110 kilowatts when the installation is substantially complete, determined based on departure from the job site following completion of the installation or passing of building inspection, while we recognize revenue from solar energy system installations equal to or greater than 110 kilowatts on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S3	We recognize revenue from the sale of renewable and sustainable energy products when the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S4	We recognize amounts billed to customers for postage and handling as revenue at the same time that the revenues arising from the product sale are recognized.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S5	We include postage and handling costs, which were approximately $0.2 million each year for 2010, 2009 and 2008, in selling and operating expense along with other fulfillment costs.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S6	The current asset Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represents contract costs incurred but not recognizable until recognition of the related contract revenue.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P22_S7	The current liability Deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	As a result, the accounts receivable on our consolidated balance as of December 31, 2009 included $2.3 million of revenues in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	Revenues in excess of billings were immaterial at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Allocation of Costs Gaiam provides us with management, financial, audit, accounting, tax, treasury, human resources, payroll, technical, fulfillment, inventory management, customer service and certain occupancy and related office services under an intercorporate services agreement.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	Our accompanying financial statements include an allocation of these expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	The allocation is based on a combination of factors, including revenue, order counts, and operating expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P24_S3	We believe the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in an appropriate allocation of costs incurred by Gaiam and its subsidiaries on our behalf.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P24_S4	However, these allocations may not be indicative of the cost of future services.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Share-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	In estimating this fair value, there are certain assumptions that we use, as disclosed in Note 6, Share-Based Compensation, consisting of the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S4	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S5	We did not grant any stock-based awards until 2007.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S6	Prior to our initial public offering, we determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant of stock awards based on the combination of two factors: an independent offer to purchase a portion of us in exchange for preferred stock and the value of recent acquisitions.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S7	Income Taxes For financial reporting purposes, we calculated income tax expense and deferred income tax balances as if we were a separate entity and had prepared our own separate tax return during all applicable periods.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S8	We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S9	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S10	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P25_S11	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Our effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	We have significant NOL carryforwards and more likely than not expect our deferred tax assets to be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	We have agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as we utilize certain of our NOLs in the future.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P26_S3	We must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P26_S4	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P27_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P27_S4	The result of the reassessment of our tax positions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Attributable To Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	We compute net income (loss) per share attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. common shareholders by dividing our net income (loss) attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. common shareholders reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue our Class A common shares were exercised.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	Common share equivalents of 584,000, 517,000 and 221,000 shares have been omitted from net income (loss) per share attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. common shareholders for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	We have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentations.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Payable to Gaiam From 1999 until our initial public offering in May 2008, our business was funded by intercompany borrowings from Gaiam and through our operating income.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	Historically, Gaiam never charged us interest on the intercompany borrowings and still does not as the payables are now short-term.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	Prior to our initial public offering, the transactions that generated the intercompany borrowings consisted of virtually all activities conducted by Gaiam on our behalf, including allocation of product and sales fulfillment costs, allocation of payroll costs, and funding used for and costs related to our business acquisitions, including the purchase of Marin Solar and Carlson Solar.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	The average balance due to Gaiam on the intercompany payables was $2.3 million, $1.4 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases We lease office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from three to five years.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	We lease our Campbell facility from DTTC Properties, LLC, a limited liability company partially owned by our former chief executive officer, who is also a beneficial shareholder of Real Goods.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The lease agreement, which expires in July 2011, requires monthly base payments of $10,080 plus common area operating expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Under this lease, we incurred expense of $161,000, $158,000 and $39,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The following schedule represents the annual future minimum payments of all our leases as of December 31, 2010:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	We incurred rent expense of $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Risks and Uncertainties We are subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of our business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and seasonal nature of our business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	We have accrued for probable and estimatable costs that may be incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available to us.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual costs could vary from those accruals.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Our share-based compensation program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors and to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Our predecessor granted options in 2007 that we assumed on January 31, 2008 as options granted under the Real Goods 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan ).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	These options vested 50% on May 13, 2008 when our initial public offering was consummated (see Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Warrants) and this vested portion was recorded as an offering cost.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	The remaining options vest 2% each month after May 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Our Incentive Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 1,000,000 of our Class A common shares.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options may be issued under the provisions of the Incentive Plan.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	Employees, members of the board of directors, consultants, business partners, and certain key advisors are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the Incentive Plan.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S3	Options under the Incentive Plan are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S4	Options vest based on performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year) or service conditions, or some combination thereof.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P40_S5	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the historical volatility of comparable public companies in our industry or, since our initial public offering, our stock price volatility.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	We currently have minimal forfeiture history and presently, due to the limited number of outstanding grants, expect only a small portion of the options to be forfeited.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The following are the variables we used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under our Incentive Plan for each of the years presented: The table below presents a summary of option activity under the Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2010, and changes during the year then ended: During 2009, for options previously granted under our Incentive Plan to three employees, including our president, we reset the exercise price to $2.92 per share and suspended option exercises for six months from the date of modification.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The options continue to vest over their remaining original vesting periods.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	These modifications will result in total incremental share-based compensation cost of approximately $20,000 during 2009 through 2011.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S3	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2.04, $1.25 and $4.07, respectively.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S4	The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2010 was $0.1 million and for 2009 and 2008 was $0.6 million each year.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S5	Our share-based compensation cost charged against income was $0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is shown in general and administrative expenses.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S6	The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.1 million each year for 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S7	For the performance based stock options granted during 2010, the attainment of the performance condition became probable during the third quarter of 2010 and, therefore, compensation expense for these grants was recorded.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S8	As of December 31, 2010, there was $0.9 million of unrecognized cost related to nonvested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P44_S9	We expect that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.9 years.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Shareholders Equity and Warrants During 2010, we issued 21,040 of our Class A common shares to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Following this transaction, Gaiam owned 54.6% of our stock.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	For the last four years, we have valued shares issued to our independent directors at estimated fair value based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date the shares were issued, which by policy is the last trading day of each quarter in which the services were rendered.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	During 2009, we issued 36,112 of our Class A common shares to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2009 and issued 163,504 of our Class A common shares as purchase price true-up and 200,000 of our Class A common shares as contingent consideration at a combined value of $0.7 million for a business acquired in 2008 (see Note 9, Mergers and Acquisitions).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	Following these transactions, Gaiam owned 54.7% of our outstanding common stock.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P46_S3	During 2008, we consummated our initial public offering of 5.5 million of our Class A common shares which we sold at $10 per share for total net offering proceeds of $48.2 million after underwriters commissions and offering costs.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P46_S4	We also issued 280,000 of our Class A common shares valued at $1.9 million to acquire a noncontrolling interest in one of our subsidiaries, issued 2,094,679 of our Class A common shares valued at $9.2 million as partial consideration to acquire 100% ownership of two businesses (see Note 9, Mergers and Acquisitions), issued an additional 15,297 of our Class A common shares valued at $94,000 to compensate independent board members for services rendered, and made other non-share related equity transactions.

1425565_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Following these transactions, Gaiam owned 55.9% of our stock as of December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Our shares are generally valued based upon the closing price of our Class A common shares, which ranged from $2.89 to $8.84 per share during the period from May 8, 2008 to December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	Additionally, upon consummation of our initial public offering on May 13, 2008, we ceased to be a member of Gaiam s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and, under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of certain pre-initial public offering tax loss carryforwards we utilize from our separate tax returns.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance of $2.4 million against certain of our tax loss carryforwards as of the effective date of the tax sharing agreement.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	The valuation allowance charge, which did not require tax affecting, is reported in our additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	On March 21, 2008, Gaiam converted 7,846,707 of our Class B common shares into Class A common shares.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	As part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Carlson Solar on January 1, 2008 we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 30,000 of our Class A common shares at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	On November 1, 2007, as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Marin Solar, we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 40,000 of our Class A common shares at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we had the following Class A common shares reserved for future issuance: Each holder of our Class A common shares is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S4	Each Class B common share is entitled to ten votes on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P49_S5	There are no cumulative voting rights.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	All holders of Class A common shares and Class B common shares vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Accordingly, Gaiam, as the holder of a majority of the Class A common shares and Class B common shares entitled to vote in any election of directors, may elect all of the directors who stand for election.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Our Class A common shares and Class B common shares are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the board of directors out of legally available funds.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Real Goods, our Class A common shares and Class B common shares are entitled to share ratably in our assets remaining after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	Holders of our Class A common shares and Class B common shares have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Class A common shares and Class B common shares.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Income Taxes Prior to our initial public offering we calculated income tax expense and deferred income tax balances as if we were a separate entity from Gaiam and had prepared our own separate tax returns.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	Prior to our initial public offering, the resulting income taxes were settled through the Payable to Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	Our provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had $0.3 million in tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, will begin to expire in 2018.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	Additionally, we had $2.2 million in tax effected federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P55_S3	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, begin to expire in 2018.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that limit the net operating loss available for use in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership interest.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	A change in ownership of a company of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership changes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	Certain of our net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 are subject to annual limitations due to changes in ownership.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	Additionally, upon consummation of our initial public offering on May 13, 2008, we ceased to be a member of Gaiam s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S4	To the extent we become entitled to utilize pre-initial public offering loss carryforwards from our separate tax returns, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S5	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance of $2.4 million against all of our tax loss carryforwards as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S6	This valuation allowance charge, which did not require tax affecting, is reported in our additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S7	As of December 31, 2010, $5.0 million of these net operating loss carryforwards are available for utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.7 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S8	Based upon our estimated utilization of some of these loss carryforwards on our 2010 tax returns, as of December 31, 2010 we recorded a payable to Gaiam of $0.5 million, which is subject to adjustment based on our final income tax return for 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S9	We expect the remainder of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 to be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P56_S10	Accordingly, no other valuation allowances for deferred tax items were considered necessary as of December 31, 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions During 2009, as purchase price true-up and contingent consideration related to the Regrid Power acquisition, we issued 163,504 and 200,000 of our Class A common shares, respectively, with an estimated combined fair value of $0.7 million and allocated the additional consideration to goodwill, which is not expected to be tax deductible.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	the date that the consideration became payable in determining the estimated fair value of the securities issued.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	The securities were issued to a trust benefiting the former owners of Regrid Power, one of whom served as our chief executive officer for eleven months after the acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	On October 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Regrid Power, a northern California designer and installer of residential and commercial solar electric systems, for $3.8 million in cash, $8.9 million worth of our Class A common shares, $1.3 million of assumed liabilities and $0.3 million of estimated direct acquisition costs.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The purchase cost includes $72,000 of direct acquisition costs incurred by the selling shareholder for which we were reimbursed.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	In addition, this acquisition had purchase price true-up and contingent share consideration, which were settled in 2009 as described above.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	We acquired Regrid Power because it was an established local market leader with a good reputation and compatible geography.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	We realized synergies from this acquisition by leveraging our existing infrastructure as well as by taking advantage of its existing operational systems.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the Regrid Power assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	On August 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Independent Energy Systems, Inc. ( IES ), a leading solar energy integrator in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties in California, for $3.3 million in cash and $0.3 million worth of our Class A common shares, plus direct acquisition costs of $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	We recorded $3.7 million of goodwill in connection with this transaction, which is not tax deductible.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	We acquired IES because they were an established local market leader with a strong reputation and compatible geography.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S3	We realized synergies from this acquisition by leveraging our existing infrastructure.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S4	On May 23, 2008, we exchanged 280,000 of our Class A common shares for our current Chief Financial Officer s 11.6% ownership in Real Goods Carlson.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P63_S5	This resulted in the recognition of $1.5 million of goodwill, which was not deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	On January 1, 2008, our Real Goods Carlson subsidiary acquired certain assets of and assumed certain liabilities from Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Simultaneously, on the same date, we sold 11.6% of our Real Goods Carlson subsidiary for $0.4 million at the same valuation.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	We acquired Carlson Solar in order to expand our geographic presence and establish a sales office in the sizable southern California solar installation market.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S3	The Carlson Solar assets acquired were determined to have all inputs and processes necessary for the transferred assets to continue to conduct normal operations after acquisition; accordingly, the purchase price was treated as a business combination.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S4	As additional contingent consideration, we granted to the sellers warrants to purchase 30,000 of our Class A common shares for a total estimated cost of $0.1 million, which, along with the 40,000 contingent warrants granted to the sellers of Marin Solar at a total cost of $0.1 million, vested 50% on May 13, 2008 when our initial public offering was consummated (see Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Warrants).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S5	Accordingly, we recognized these warrants as additions to their respective purchase prices and allocated their costs to goodwill.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S6	The remaining warrants vest 2% each month after May 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S7	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the Carlson Solar assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P64_S8	Goodwill was deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following is supplemental unaudited pro forma information for the Carlson Solar and Regrid Power acquisitions as if we had acquired these businesses on January 1, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	The pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of these acquisitions on our historical financial information.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Net loss attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Net loss per share attributable to Real Goods Solar, Inc. common shareholders:
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	We include results from operations of acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective effective acquisition dates.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	Related Party Transactions During 2010, we commenced a project for our Chairman to design and install an upgrade to an existing solar system for Mr. Rysavy s residence.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	The contract price remains under negotiation.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S3	We anticipate submitting the contract price to our audit committee for approval prior to finalizing it.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S4	Since this transaction is being accounted for under the completed contract method, no revenue or costs have been recorded yet in our statement of operations.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S5	During 2008, we completed the installation of a solar energy system at Gaiam s headquarters in Colorado and recognized $0.8 million of revenue from this transaction in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S6	We have and will have a need for certain management and other services to be provided by Gaiam under our intercorporate services agreement.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S7	These services may include, but are not limited to, executive, management, financial, audit, accounting, tax, treasury, human resources, payroll, technical, fulfillment, inventory management, customer service and certain occupancy and related office services as required from time to time.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S8	We have determined that it is not cost effective to obtain and separately maintain the personnel and infrastructure associated with these services, particularly the costs associated with maintaining on our payroll on a full time basis with a full complement of skilled employees.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S9	Services performed under this agreement have and will be provided under our direction, and Gaiam has no power to act independently on our behalf other than as specifically authorized under the agreement or from time to time, by us.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S10	Gaiam and we have and will agree on the aggregate annual amount for a particular year for the services based upon a good faith estimate of the services required for that year and the estimated fees for such services.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S11	Upon a change to the annual amounts for a particular year, the parties have and will make appropriate payments to reflect such change.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P68_S12	The annual amount and formula for various services making up the annual amount, as well as any quarterly changes, have and must be approved in writing by each of Gaiam s and our board of directors.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	During 2008, as a result of changes in the business climate for solar installations, we impaired $26.4 million of goodwill and $0.8 million of other intangibles.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	The impairment of goodwill, resulting from the application GAAP, was primarily driven by adverse financial market conditions.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	The impairment took into account the deteriorating macro-economic environment, the reduced accessibility to the credit markets for customers, and the high degree of uncertainty about the eventual return to normalcy.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P69_S3	These charges were noncash and partially tax deductible (those related to our Carlson Solar acquisition).
1425565_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	We estimated the fair value of each impaired asset category using a traditional present value technique, relying upon various sources of information for our assumptions, such as estimated future sales, internal budgets and projections, and judgment.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	These asset impairment losses are reflected in impairment loss on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1425565_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our president and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2010, they have concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our History We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1991.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our second acquisition was Real Goods Trading Corporation, which was publicly traded from 1991 to 2001 when it was acquired by Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	We operated essentially as a separate business (except for certain consolidated corporate functions) from 2001 to 2008, when operations were moved into our corporate entity, Real Goods Solar, Inc., upon its formation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	We acquired Marin Solar in November 2007, Carlson Solar in January 2008, Independent Energy Systems ( IES ) in August 2008, Regrid Power, Inc. ( Regrid Power ) in October 2008, and Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc. ( Alteris ) in June 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S4	Our goal is to continue to build on our industry-leading position and be the largest and most profitable residential and commercial solar energy integrator in the United States.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P3_S5	We intend to pursue the following strategies to achieve this goal:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Enhance and leverage the Real Goods Solar brand name to increase our market presence .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	We intend to enhance and leverage the Real Goods Solar brand name and our reputation for customer service to continue to win business in existing markets and to expand into new markets in which our competitors have little or no brand recognition.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Expand into markets in which legislation and government incentives are favorable for solar energy .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We plan to expand the geographic scope of our business as jurisdictions adopt new or improve existing incentive programs that enhance the economics of solar energy systems for a broader customer base.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	In addition to the $3.4 billion California Solar Initiative, or CSI, adopted in 2007, a number of states, including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, have adopted legislation and incentives favorable to solar energy and other states are considering adopting such legislation and incentives.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Federal law provides a 30% investment tax credit that was extended for eight years in 2008, when the $2,000 cap on the credit for residential systems was removed.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe that this tax credit will continue to stimulate the solar market on a national basis.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Consolidate the fragmented U.S. solar energy system installation market .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The U.S. solar energy system installation market remains highly fragmented, with over 300 independent installers or integrators in California alone.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	We intend to continue our consolidation activities in order to penetrate new markets, expand our business and further enhance our national brand and leverage our national marketing programs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	We plan to create economies of scale through our consolidation activities in order to increase our operating efficiencies, with a goal of improving our margins and profitability.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Expand our community of customers to enhance revenue and lower our customer acquisition costs .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We intend to leverage the reputation for authenticity associated with our Real Goods Solar brand to expand our community of customers, which cares deeply about solar energy and a renewable energy lifestyle and views us as the premier solar EPC provider.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	We intend to leverage our customer base to continue to provide us with new leads and referrals, which, in conjunction with our marketing efforts, should allow us to continue to lower our customer acquisition costs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Make a difference in the world .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to promote our solar energy systems as a way for individuals and communities to reduce their carbon footprint, eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign and fossil fuel-based energy sources and foster a culture of respect for the Earth and its natural resources for the benefit of future generations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Competitive Advantages We believe that we have a number of advantages over our competitors, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe that our customers often buy our solar energy systems because of the strength of the Real Goods Solar brand, our longevity in the marketplace and our reputation for excellent customer service.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	As a result of over 30 years of operating in the solar energy industry, we believe that we are frequently the first company in the industry approached by new solar companies with innovative products.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have a highly experienced management team.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our Chief Executive Officer, William Yearsley, has more than 30 years of experience in the EPC construction industry.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition, our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, founded and grew Corporate Express from $30 million to $3 billion in revenue in less than five years, and founded Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Mr. Rysavy and other members of our management team have considerable experience in the consolidation of fragmented industries, having acquired over 250 companies.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our business model gives us a significant marketing advantage by providing us access to potential purchasers of solar energy systems from visitors to our Solar Living Center and from our strong web presence.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, our strong brand name and reputation for outstanding customer service provide us with word-of-mouth referrals.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We maintain strong relationships with many leading solar PV module manufacturers, including Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower, which provides us with continued access to a supply of our key system components and early review of innovative market products.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our financial strength and market position enable us to purchase directly from these manufacturers which lowers our purchasing costs relative to those of many of our competitors that are only able to purchase through third-party distributors.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We had $11.8 million of cash and only $1.0 million of debt and capital lease obligations at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that our strong balance sheet and our overall financial strength meaningfully differentiate us from our competitors, providing our suppliers and customers with confidence in our stability and longevity, and further supporting our consolidation strategy.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe that as demand for electric power increases, the electric power industry will face various challenges, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Power industry at peak capacity with aging infrastructure .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	A majority of U.S. power plants in highly populated areas approach capacity during times of peak usage.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	Additionally, over half of U.S. power plants are more than 30 years old.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	In order to meet the rising demand for electric power, additional plants will need to be constructed and the aging existing plant infrastructure will require significant capital investment.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Although coal, the largest non-renewable energy resource, is estimated to have over 100 years of reserves left, the rate of global energy consumption is expected to continue to increase, jeopardizing economical access to sufficient energy supply for future generations if renewable energy sources are not developed.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	As a result of aging infrastructure and high energy demand, residential and commercial customers are facing rising electricity rates, creating economic pressures for consumers and businesses alike.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pollution and climate change concerns .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy sources, including coal, create environmental pollution, and there is significant local resistance to new coal-fired power plants in populated areas.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	Concerns about climate change, global warming and greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in international efforts to reduce such emissions, and various states have enacted stricter emissions control laws or mandated that utilities comply with renewable portfolio standards ( RPS ), which require the generation of a certain amount of power from renewable sources.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that increased concerns about climate change is likely to result in increased focus on alternative energy sources.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P22_S4	Because the solar energy industry offers solutions to these challenges, we believe it has extremely large growth potential.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Currently, less than one percent of the world s power is generated from solar energy sources.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Drivers of Solar Energy Industry Growth We expect a number of factors will contribute to growth in the solar energy industry, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	A number of initiatives have been enacted by the federal government and various states, municipalities and utilities that encourage or require the installation of grid-tied solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	In 1996, the state of California enabled individual energy systems to tie into the conventional utility grid and began to require that various rebates and incentives be provided to support the use of solar energy systems, making California the focus for the development of the solar energy market in the United States.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	California has mandated an increase in the percentage of renewable energy retail sales by certain utilities to 20%, with a goal of 33% by 2020.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	Colorado has enacted an RPS goal of 20% for investor-owned utilities and 10% for electric cooperatives and municipal utilities serving more than 40,000 customers by 2020.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The various states in the northeast in which we operate have also implemented a variety of solar initiatives.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	As RPS programs are implemented, it is common for financial incentives to be made available, making the purchase of solar energy systems more affordable and opening additional solar markets in the United States.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Rebates offered to customers or integrators reduce the initial cost of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Several states, including California and Colorado, require certain utilities to offer rebates that can substantially reduce the costs of installing solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	These rebates, coupled with tax credits, substantially reduce the customer s out-of-pocket cost for purchasing a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	There is currently a 30% federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar energy systems, and in October 2008 Congress extended the availability of this credit for both residential and commercial solar installations for another eight years and eliminated the $2,000 cap on the tax credit for residential installations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Other incentives, such as net metering, time-of-use credits and performance-based incentives, are provided to consumers based on the amount of electricity their solar energy systems generate.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Currently, over three quarters of the states have required some of their utility providers to accept net metering.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Net metering allows residential and small-scale commercial solar energy producers to sell excess power generated by their systems to their utility companies, through existing electric meters, at standard retail prices.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Time-of-use metering allows customers to sell solar power to their utility for higher rates during peak times when traditional loads are at their highest demand.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	These customers can then buy back electricity from the utilities during off-peak times at a much lower rate, providing them an additional financial benefit for solar installations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Performance-based incentives, or PBIs, reward customers based on the generation of their solar energy over time, as opposed to through an initial rebate.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	In many states, the installation of a solar energy system generates a renewable energy credit, which is marketable in certain states.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	In certain jurisdictions, such as California, assessors are prohibited from increasing a solar energy system owner s property tax assessment as a result of the added value of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Benefits of solar energy systems .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Solar energy as a source of electrical power offers the following benefits compared to conventional energy sources:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The cost of electricity generated by a solar energy system is essentially fixed at the time of installation, providing a hedge against utility electricity price increases and inflation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Solar energy systems generate much of their electricity during the afternoon when the sun s rays are strongest and when the greatest demand for electricity for air conditioning occurs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Customers can use their solar energy systems energy to replace peak time conventional electricity, which can be more expensive and less reliable than electricity purchased during non-peak times.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	In addition, solar energy systems typically have low operating expenses because the systems require minimal maintenance over their expected lives.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Versatility and ease of installation .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Solar energy systems can generate electricity in any location that receives sunlight, while relatively fewer locations have both the infrastructure and natural resources required to support other forms of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind and geothermal.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Solar energy systems can be installed directly at sites where power is needed, reducing conventional electrical transmission and distribution costs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	The use of solar energy systems improves energy security by reducing fossil fuel purchases from hostile or politically or economically unstable countries and by reducing power strains on local electrical transmission and distribution systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Challenges to the Solar Energy Industry We believe growth in the solar energy industry faces the following challenges:
1425565_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The decision to install a solar energy system represents a significant investment of approximately $10,000 to $30,000 or more (net of rebates and federal tax credits), if purchased outright, for the typical home.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Financing sources specifically for solar energy systems, including loans and system leases, are not always available depending upon the state and the customer s credit rating.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	The return on each customer s investment in a solar energy system will occur over a different period or at a different rate depending upon individual circumstances.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	A potential purchaser has to weigh the costs associated with the initial investment decision against the potential benefit associated with anticipated longer-term utility cost reductions, increased property value and low system maintenance costs provided by a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The solar energy industry is significantly driven by federal, state and local regulations and incentives, which are continually changing.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	Changes in regulations and incentives could adversely affect the economic viability of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Supply of solar PV modules .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	At times in recent years, there has been a global shortage of solar PV modules, which has resulted in some price increases and limited availability for solar PV modules.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	While we believe that the risk of future shortages has lessened, it is always a possibility.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition, other problems with the supply chain could impair the timely delivery of key system components.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Cost of traditional energy sources .
1425565_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	The cost of solar power generation is often compared by customers to the cost of traditional sources of electricity generation such as coal.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Traditional power plants are relatively cheap to build but expensive to operate when the true price of their environmental impact is considered.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	Solar power plants are more expensive to build but cheaper to operate over the long-term, with minimal environmental impact.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	The growth of the solar power industry is dependent on how consumers weigh the relative importance of construction costs relative to the operating costs for both types of electricity production and the extent to which government mandates require traditional power plants to incorporate environmental costs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The challenging economic environment has created a challenging business climate for the purchase of solar systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	We believe that many customers remain interested in solar but are electing to postpone their decision to install a system until they have better visibility into the economy and their own personal financial situation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Services We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	We install residential and commercial systems that are generally between 3 kilowatts, or kW, and 1megawatt, or MW, output, with the average residential installation being approximately 5 kW output.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects of up to 3MW output.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	We design and build our solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average daily consumption rates in different seasons of the year to size the solar energy system and engineer its wiring.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar PV modules.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S6	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory and its rate structures and the customer s budget and preferred financing method, as well as the customer s aesthetic preferences.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S7	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, that are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates and various other factors.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S8	We assess this data using solar monitoring tools and analytical calculations, which enable us to design a solar energy system to a size and configuration that maximizes energy efficiency for each customer s circumstances.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S9	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit which is necessary for rebate processing.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P46_S10	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis and determine the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	As soon as the building permit is approved, our installation professionals begin the installation by placing metal racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the solar PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	We do not custom manufacture solar PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	After the solar PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction and at the same time apply for the local utility company to interconnect the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The entire process from signing of the contract through final inspection by the local building department typically takes between 60 to 90 days, with the actual installation work usually requiring two to three days.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	A basic solar energy system has no moving parts and consists of a number of solar PV modules wired together and mounted on a metal framing structure, an inverter and the balance of systems and safety equipment necessary to connect the system to the customer s existing utility service.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	We source solar PV modules from several primary manufacturers: Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, and SunPower.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	These modules range in conversion efficiency from 12% to 19%.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Solar PV modules can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono- and poly-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide, or CIGS, and cadmium telluride.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Developments in solar PV technology have generated advances in the conversion efficiency of solar PV cells, reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in manufacturing yields.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	An inverter is an electronic device that converts the low-voltage DC power generated by solar PV modules to conventional 120-volt AC power used by standard household lights and appliances.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	While an inverter may need to be replaced approximately 15 years after installation, other system components typically do not require replacement during the 20- to 25-year warranty period applicable to solar PV modules.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Individual solar energy systems are connected to the utility grid by an inverter, which also allows the excess electricity produced to flow into the grid, causing the customer s electric meter effectively to run backwards, to the credit of the customer s utility account, sometimes at standard retail prices.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	A customer that has a grid-connected solar energy system draws energy from the grid through the conventional local utility when the sun is not shining, or when household energy consumption exceeds the solar energy system s energy generation capacity.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Warranty Terms Most manufacturers of solar PV modules currently offer a 20- to 25-year transferable warranty of their products.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	We offer a 10-year parts and labor warranty, which may also involve claims of property damage arising from the installation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	We generally handle manufacturer warranty claims for solar PV modules as part of our customer service and we are typically reimbursed by the manufacturers for our labor and materials.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	Historically, our costs associated with warranty claims have been minimal.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Financing While many of our customers choose to purchase their solar energy systems without the use of financing, we also connect our customers with preferred third-party financing sources.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	We also work with solar financiers who lease solar systems to our customers over 10 to 20 year periods.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	We handle some of the administrative processing for our customers that choose to use third-party financing or leasing.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	Loss of preferred third-party financing and leasing sources for our customers could adversely affect our business as it would reduce funding alternatives available to homeowners seeking to install a solar system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Sales and Marketing Our conventional marketing program includes presentation booths at tradeshows and consumer shows, Internet search engine optimization, pay-per-click ad words, Internet banner advertisements, affiliate marketing programs, canvassing, community involvement initiatives and customer referral programs.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	To enhance our solar energy integration business by generating leads of potential solar energy system customers and promoting our brand awareness, we operate our Solar Living Center and maintain a robust website.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our website provides pricing tools, media programming, in-depth articles and product information, and how-to instructional content.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	We also receive new customer leads from the referrals of our satisfied customers, through our customer rewards and affinity programs, from designers and architects with whom we have worked on previous projects, and through the strength and longevity of our Real Goods Solar brand name and reputation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S4	We believe that these attractive sources of leads lower our customer acquisition costs to below what we estimate they would be if we were to rely solely on traditional marketing methods such as print, radio, television and Internet search words.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S5	After we receive these high-quality leads, our inside sales representatives conduct an extensive telephone interview of the potential customer during which we determine, among other things, information about the customer s site, location, and solar exposure, and that the customer and any relevant family member or co-owner is genuinely interested in and able to finance the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S6	We use this focused customer qualification process to identify which potential customers are most likely to respond positively to our direct sales efforts before we make a site visit to the customer s location.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S7	We then utilize our direct sales force to pursue these qualified leads.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P56_S8	This qualification process further lowers our customer acquisition costs because it narrows our customer leads and allows us to focus our direct sales efforts on highly targeted customers.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	We own the Real Goods Solar Living Center, which is located on a 12-acre campus in Hopland, California, approximately 95 miles north of San Francisco.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	The Solar Living Center is a demonstration site for the technology and culture of solar living and serves as a very effective source of qualified leads for solar installations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	In 2011, the Solar Living Center had over 150,000 visitors.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	Since it opened in 1996, more than 2.5 million people have visited the Solar Living Center, and it has become one of the largest tourist attractions in Northern California throughout the year.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our residential customers have historically shared a number of characteristics.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	They tend to be college-educated homeowners, 30 to 65 years in age, high-income earners who are generally motivated both by environmental and economic reasons to install a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our residential solar energy systems are generally 10kW or smaller in size, and our commercial solar energy systems are generally no larger than 1MW in size.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our typical residential customer is connected to the utility grid.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our commercial customers have included wineries, schools, apartment buildings, low income housing communities, churches and retail facilities.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Suppliers We do not manufacture solar PV modules, inverters or other components used in our solar energy systems, but purchase those components directly from manufacturers or, in some cases, from third-party distributors.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	We purchase solar PV modules manufactured by Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, SunPower and others.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S4	We purchase inverters manufactured by SMA, Enphase and others.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S5	We currently purchase the components used in our solar energy systems on a purchase order basis from a select group of manufacturers or suppliers.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S6	If we are unable to purchase from any of these sources in the future, we do not believe we would have difficulty in securing alternative supply sources, because all of the components we use in our solar energy systems are available from a number of different sources.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P60_S7	With that said, the world-wide market for solar PV modules has from time to time experienced shortages of supply that have increased prices and affected availability.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	The solar energy industry is in its early stages of development and is highly fragmented, consisting of many small, privately held companies with limited resources and operating histories but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or low overhead requirements.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	A number of competitors exist in the California market, including companies such as REC Solar, Verengo and Solar City.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	Several of our competitors have expanded their market share in the California market by opening multiple offices within the state.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	We estimate that we are currently in the top two residential solar energy system installers in California.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	competitors include Namaste Solar Electric, REC Solar and Solar City, but we are not aware of published data regarding competitive positions in Colorado.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	In the northeast, our competitors include Solar City, Sungevity, Trinity Solar and others.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	We compete on factors such as brand recognition, quality of services and products, pricing, speed and quality of installation.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Regulations Solar integrator services are subject to oversight and regulation by national and local ordinances, including building, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection regulations, utility interconnection requirements for metering and other rules and regulations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our design and engineering teams design and install solar energy systems to comply with these varying standards as well as to minimize the installation and operating costs of each system.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Our operations are also subject to generally applicable laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into the environment and protection of the environment; however, because our operations do not typically involve any such discharge, there are no material effects on our business relating to our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	We operate under and have registered the tradenames Real Goods , which was last renewed in 2004, and Real Goods Solar , which is pending a tradename application.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S4	We believe these tradenames are significant assets to our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S5	The Real Goods tradename registration is valid for ten years and we endeavor to maintain such registrations as valid and current by filing all required renewal forms when due.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P63_S6	In addition, we hold the copyright for most of the contents of the Solar Living Sourcebook.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather in certain geographic regions.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	Much of the seasonality in the business in previous quarters has been offset by changes in government activities as well as strong organic growth.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	With the addition of Alteris, we expect increased seasonal fluctuations due to the severity of winters in the northeast.
1425565_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	As of February 24, 2012, we had approximately 381 full-time and 13 part-time employees, including installation personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Government subsidies are an important economic factor in the determination to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Certain states, localities and utilities offer incentives to offset a portion of the cost of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These incentives can take many forms, including direct rebates, state tax credits, system performance payments and renewable energy credits, or RECs.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The reduction or elimination of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Adverse general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, business conditions, stock market volatility, weather conditions, acts of terrorism, threats of war, and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If the economic conditions continue to be adverse or worsen, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The ongoing financial crisis and the loss of confidence in the stock market has increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Increases in funding costs and limitations on our access to liquidity could have a negative impact on our earnings and our ability to consummate additional acquisitions.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, the deteriorating general economic conditions in the United States has caused a drop in consumer spending in general, and discretionary spending in particular.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This has caused a decline in the number of purchases of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Overall, the economic environment during our 2011 fiscal year has been slightly adverse for our business compared to the previous year and there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Until they do, we expect our results of operations to be slightly adversely affected.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development, and the extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to grow our business at the rate we desire.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S7	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A drop in the retail price of conventional energy or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional energy, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Inexpensive prices for oil and other fossil fuels and electricity could also have a negative effect on our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date about these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis and payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, and any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on our system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis and, as a result, our revenue from these installations is driven by the performance of our contractual obligations, which is generally driven by timelines for the installation of our solar power systems at customer sites.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	This could result in unpredictability of revenue and, in the short term, a revenue decrease.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As with any project-related business, there is the potential for delays within any particular customer project.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Variation of project timelines and estimates may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Because we must invest substantial time and incur significant expense in advance of achieving milestones and the receipt of payment, failure to achieve milestones could adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Existing regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	For example, metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that could deter purchases of solar energy systems and investment in the research and development of solar energy technology.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Without a mandated regulatory exception for solar energy systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Such fees could increase the cost to our customers of using solar energy systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Changes in net metering policies could also deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rates rather than with the less expensive average price of electricity.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate, would require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant market share.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from our solar energy integration services from sales in west coast and northeast states.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from solar energy integration services from projects in fewer than ten states located in the west coast and northeast.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our business plan and proposed strategy have not been independently evaluated.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have not obtained any independent evaluation of our business plan and proposed business strategy.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There can be no assurance that our business plan and proposed strategy will generate sufficient revenues to maintain profitability.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our success may depend in part on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As part of our business strategy, we plan to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions in our current markets and in new geographic markets.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We acquired several businesses over the last few years.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These risks, as well as other circumstances that often accompany expansion through acquisitions, could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, the size, timing and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Consequently, our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our failure to integrate the operations of acquired businesses successfully into our operations or to manage our anticipated growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In order to pursue a successful acquisition strategy, we must integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that leverage our revenue and growth opportunities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	The integration of the management, operations, and facilities of acquired businesses with our own could involve difficulties, which could adversely affect our growth rate and operating results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We may be unable to complete effectively the integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; to manage efficiently the combined operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; to achieve our operating, growth and performance goals for acquired businesses; to achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or to achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Our rate of growth and operating performance may suffer if we fail to manage acquired businesses profitably without substantial additional costs or operational problems or to implement effectively combined growth and operating strategies.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs and the size, timing and structure of future acquisitions.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Any borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on future borrowings.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S13	If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S14	In addition, our operations may not generate sufficient cash for our acquisition plans.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S15	The extent to which we would be able or willing to use our equity to consummate future acquisitions will depend on the market price of our equity from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept our equity as full or partial payment.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S16	Using our equity for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our shareholders.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S17	To the extent that we are unable to use our equity to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose through debt or equity financings.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S18	The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S19	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations, and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S20	As of December 31, 2011, we had indebtedness of approximately $1.0 million.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S21	We have available to us a revolving line of credit of up to $7 million, of which $6.5 million was drawn on March 14, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P18_S22	In addition, we received a loan of $1.7 million from Gaiam under the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the Alteris merger and have available to us an additional $3.15 million under a commitment made by Riverside under the Shareholders Agreement.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet our long-term debt service obligations.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our available credit in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements and our debt service requirements may increase significantly.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P20_S8	The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Other than with respect to Erik Zech, our chief financial officer, we have not entered into employment agreements with our senior executives and key personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Further, the expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S9	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S10	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S11	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S12	Our success depends on the value of our Real Goods Solar brand.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S13	We depend on the name recognition of our Real Goods Solar brand in our marketing efforts.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Maintaining and building recognition of our brand are important to expanding our customer base.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S15	If the value of our brand were adversely affected, our ability to attract customers would be negatively impacted and our growth could be impaired.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S16	Our failure to protect our brands may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our brands or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S17	We believe that it is important for our business to achieve brand recognition.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S18	We rely primarily on tradenames to achieve this.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S19	Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S20	In addition, policing unauthorized use of our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property can be difficult and expensive.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S21	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S22	We cannot give assurance that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S23	Such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend our other resources away from our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S24	An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects, and reputation.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S25	We are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S26	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S27	Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S28	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S29	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S30	We depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our solar energy systems and our inability to purchase components would adversely affect our results of operations.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S31	We rely on third-party suppliers for components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S32	During 2011, Kyocera, Sharp, SunTech, Canadian Solar and SunPower accounted for over 80% of our purchases of solar PV modules; and SMA and Enphase accounted for over 90% of our purchases of inverters.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S33	The failure of our suppliers to supply us with components in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules and harm our operating results and business expansion efforts.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P23_S34	Our orders with certain of our suppliers may represent a very small portion of their total business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	give priority to our business, leading to potential delays in or cancellation of our orders.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If any of our suppliers were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Shortages in the supply of silicon or other supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Shortages of silicon and other supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules we use in our solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Manufacturers of solar PV modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar PV modules.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Shortages of silicon cause the prices for solar PV modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar PV modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If the U.S. government imposes unfair trade practices duties on certain imports used in our business, our cost of doing business may increase and our result of operations may decrease.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Historically, we have purchased solar panels and other products used in our business manufactured both in China and elsewhere.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	On October 19, 2011, SolarWorld Industries America Inc. filed antidumping duty and countervailing duty petitions with the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission concerning imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules (solar cells), from the People s Republic of China.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In the event that antidumping duties or countervailing duties are imposed as a result, those duties will be imposed on all imports of the products subject to the petitions and make such imports more expensive for the importer and downstream purchasers, including us, to the extent that we purchase such imports.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Further, the imposition of additional duties on some products used in the U.S. solar panel installation industry may cause the market price of other, competing products used in the industry to increase as well because the downward pressure on product prices in the industry is decreased.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	It is expected that the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission will make final determinations in the ongoing investigations by the end of the third quarter 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors could prevent us from completing installations as planned, including the escalation of construction costs beyond increments anticipated in our installation budgets.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Solar installations have certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical and mechanical malfunction.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, our projects entail additional risks related to structural heights.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our installation projects also entail significant risks, including:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	increases in the cost of solar panels and other products used in our installations, including as a result of unfair trade duties described elsewhere in these risk factors, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our construction and installation projects.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of market share or reduced margins.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and fragmented with low barriers to entry.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We currently compete with a large number of relatively small installers and integrators, some of which do not have extensive industry experience and may lack adequate systems and capital, but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	As the solar energy industry expands and industry consolidation occurs, we are more likely to encounter competition from larger companies, some of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S7	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S9	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S10	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S11	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S12	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S13	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a 10-year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P36_S14	In addition, most manufacturers of solar PV modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims and we have not had material warranty claims in the past, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial condition.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We must meet the NASDAQ Global Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	There can be no assurance that we will meet the continued listing requirements for the NASDAQ Global Market, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market in the future.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S6	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S7	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P38_S8	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The SEC rules and the NASDAQ Global Stock Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We currently comply with the SEC and NASDAQ requirements regarding director independence.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	However, in the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ s independence requirements in the future and we fail to regain compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing requirements, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, as further described in the previous risk factor.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S8	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P39_S9	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Accordingly, shareholders would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Securities analysts may not continue to cover our Class A common stock, and this may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock s market price.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are covered by securities analysts, and our stock is downgraded, our stock price would likely decline.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If the analyst ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Ownership could be diluted by future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock or the exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants or convertible notes to purchase capital stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S6	In particular, we may sell securities in the future in order to finance operations, expansions, or particular projects or expenditures.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S7	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Our Class A common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol RSOL.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S9	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance of any liquidity or resale value of our Class A common stock, and shareholders may be required to hold shares of our Class A common stock for an indefinite period of time.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Risk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam and Riverside Renewable Energy Investment LLC ( Riverside ) Gaiam and Riverside have significant influence over Real Goods Solar and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Gaiam and Riverside hold approximately 37.5% and 29.3%, respectively, of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Gaiam and Riverside currently each has the right to designate two individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors and they have agreed to vote their securities in favor of the election to our board of directors of these designated individuals.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Because of their voting rights and their ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, each of them will be able to exert significant influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares available for issuance under our Incentive Plan.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, who is also the Chairman of Gaiam, currently owns approximately 27% of the outstanding equity, and in excess of 50% of the voting power, of Gaiam and is one of two individuals designated by Gaiam to serve on our board of directors.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Gaiam and Riverside are not prohibited from selling a significant interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Gaiam and Riverside did not maintain voting significance over us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our historical financial information for periods prior to our initial public offering do not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S6	The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented or will be in the future.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S7	We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we or Gaiam terminate our Intercorporate Services Agreement, or if we are unable to establish on a cost-effective basis our own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a stand-alone company after the expiration or termination of our Intercorporate Services Agreement with Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S9	In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into an Intercorporate Services Agreement to retain the ability for specified periods to use certain Gaiam resources.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S10	This agreement automatically renews on a quarterly basis.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S11	Any decision by us to terminate this agreement would be approved by disinterested members of our management and board of directors under our procedures regarding related party transactions.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S12	In connection with the expiration or termination of this agreement, we will need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contracts with third parties to replace Gaiam s services.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S13	These services may not be provided at the same level as when we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Gaiam, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits that we received prior to the separation.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S14	These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and after our agreement with Gaiam expires or is terminated, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at prices and on terms as favorable as we currently have with Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S15	Any failure or significant downtime in our own administrative systems or in Gaiam s administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs, impact our results or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on a timely basis.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S16	Our inability to resolve any disputes that arise between us and Gaiam with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may result in a reduction of our revenue, and such disputes may also result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P44_S17	Disputes may arise between Gaiam and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including the following:
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	business opportunities that may be attractive to both Gaiam and us.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, we have indemnification obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Intercorporate Services Agreement, Facility Lease Agreement and Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement with Gaiam, and disputes between us and Gaiam may result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	However, we do not currently expect that these indemnification obligations will materially affect our potential liability compared to what it would be if we did not enter into these agreements with Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Some of our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Gaiam common stock, options to acquire Gaiam common stock and positions with Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Some of our directors and executive officers own Gaiam common stock and options to purchase Gaiam common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S6	In addition, some of our directors are also directors and/or executive officers of Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Ownership of Gaiam common stock and options to purchase Gaiam common stock by our directors and officers and the presence of directors and executive officers of Gaiam on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S8	For example, corporate opportunities may arise that are applicable or complementary to both of our businesses and that each business would be free to pursue, such as the potential acquisition of a particular business or technology focused on environmental sustainability including renewable energy sources, energy efficiency or energy use reduction.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S9	However, we understand that Gaiam does not intend to acquire businesses that are focused on solar energy.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S10	We have not established at this time any procedural mechanisms to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest of these directors and officers and expect that our board of directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, will determine how to address any actual or perceived conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S11	If any corporate opportunity arises and if our directors and officers do not pursue it on our behalf, we may not become aware of, and may potentially lose, a significant business opportunity.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S12	Possible future sales of shares by Gaiam or Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S13	Gaiam or Riverside may sell any or all of the shares of common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S14	Under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement among Gaiam, Riverside and us, entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Gaiam and Riverside have the right to require us to register the shares of Class A common stock that they own to facilitate the possible sale of such shares.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S15	However, Gaiam and Riverside have agreed not to exercise their registration rights for the time being pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement they entered into with us in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger.
1425565_12_ITEM1A_P45_S16	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Gaiam or Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.
1425565_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	offices are located in Louisville, Colorado.
1425565_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Hopland, California property is also the location of a 12-acre Solar Living Center.
1425565_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities:
1425565_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 6 months to 6 years.
1425565_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that suitable additional facilities will be available for lease or purchase when, and as, we need them.
1425565_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P0_S0	Market for registrant s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities Stock Price History Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol RSOL .

1425565_12_ITEM4_P1_S2	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P1_S3	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P2_S0	Sale of Unregistered Securities In connection with the closing of the Alteris merger on December 19, 2011, we issued 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to the sellers (former members of Alteris) as consideration for Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P2_S1	The shares were valued at $21.6 million based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P2_S2	We issued the shares pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P2_S3	In issuing the shares, we relied on the representations and warranties of Alteris members in support of the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Regulation D. On December 31, 2011, we issued 2,153,293 shares of our Class A common stock to Gaiam upon Gaiam s conversion of its remaining 2,153,293 shares of our Class B common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P2_S4	We issued the shares pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1425565_12_ITEM4_P3_S0	The following table summarizes equity compensation plan information for our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2011:
1425565_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	should read the following selected consolidated financial data together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 from our audited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial data for 2008 includes the effects of our acquisitions from the date of the transaction.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P0_S2	Our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Gaiam expenses, including costs of fulfillment, customer service, financial and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P0_S3	The expense allocations are based on what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Income tax expenses were calculated on the separate return approach.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	The historical financial data in our audited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows will be in the future, or, with respect to periods prior to our initial public offering, what such results would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	(a) Net income per share for 2007 is calculated as if Gaiam transferred our business assets and operations to us in return for 10,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock on January 1, 2007.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	We did not exist as a separate company during 2007.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	We computed earnings per share based on the shares outstanding following this contribution as if such shares were outstanding from the beginning of the periods presented.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) We restated 2008 to reflect the correction of immaterial errors with regards to income taxes.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	Income tax benefit was reduced and net loss was increased by $364 thousand, and net loss per share increased by $0.03.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P3_S2	See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	We restated total assets and total shareholders equity to reflect the correction of immaterial errors with regards to income taxes for 2008.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	Commencing with 2008, total assets and total shareholders equity were each reduced by $364 thousand.
1425565_12_ITEM6_P4_S2	See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K. Overview We are a leading residential and commercial solar energy EPC provider.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	We install residential and commercial systems that are generally between 3 kW and 1MW output, with the average residential installation being approximately 5 kW output.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects of up to 3MW output.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	Our revenues primarily result from the installation of solar energy systems.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S7	We also derive a portion of our revenues from the retail sale of renewable energy products.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P0_S8	Our expenses primarily consist of labor costs incurred in connection with solar installations, product costs for solar photovoltaic modules and other products sold, and related office and warehouse costs.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	2011 was a significant year for us.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We executed our largest business acquisition to date, establishing ourselves as one of just a few national solar EPC providers.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We now have much stronger geographical diversification of our revenue, as well as a more balanced mix between commercial and residential customers.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We have also focused on centralizing a number of key operational functions that will allow us to more effectively scale our business.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	As we go through 2012, we anticipate continuing to build on our 2011 accomplishments by expanding marketing and sales efforts to further leverage our solar installation capabilities while beginning to take advantage of our scalability and centralization efforts.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	We continue to expect strong demand for both residential and commercial solar installations despite the overall economic weakness in the United States.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions Marin Solar, Inc.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	On November 1, 2007, we purchased 100% ownership of Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	As additional consideration we granted to the sellers warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	The warrants have a seven year term and were still outstanding at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Carlson Solar On January 1, 2008, our then 88.4% owned subsidiary acquired certain of the assets of and assumed certain liabilities from Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	As part of the acquisition, as additional consideration, we granted warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	The warrants have a seven year term.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The assets acquired were determined to have all inputs and processes necessary for the transferred assets to continue to conduct normal operations after acquisition; accordingly, the purchase price was treated as a business combination.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	On May 23, 2008, we exchanged 280,000 shares of our Class A common stock for our current Chief Financial Officer s 11.6% ownership in Real Goods Carlson Inc.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The warrants have a seven year term and were still outstanding at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	On August 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of IES for $3.3 million in cash and $0.3 million worth of our Class A common stock, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	On October 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of Regrid Power through a merger into one of our subsidiaries, for an aggregate of $3.8 million in cash and 2,047,256 shares of our Class A common stock, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, subject to post closing adjustments, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.3 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	During 2009, as purchase price true-up and contingent consideration related to this acquisition, we issued 163,504 shares and 200,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock with an estimated combined fair value of $0.7 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	We obtained financial control, through an Agreement and Plan of Merger, of 100% of the voting equity interests of Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc. on June 21, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	The total consideration transferred was approximately $21.7 million and was comprised of 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $21.6 million based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011, and $0.1 million worth of replacement share-based payment awards attributable to services rendered prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists primarily of solar energy system installation fees.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	As a result of a recent business acquisition (see Note 3.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), we slightly modified our method of applying revenue recognition for fixed price contracts in that we now recognize revenue from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness, and current economic trends.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located in various warehouse facilities and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the enterprise level.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The annual process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	In assessing our goodwill for impairment, we use a combination of factors, including comparable company market values and multiples of revenue to the extent the information is available.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	If comparable market information is insufficient, we expect to supplement our assessment with other approaches, such as present value techniques, which will require us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	Application of alternative assumptions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, independent expert appraisals.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	In calculating this fair value, there are certain highly subjective assumptions that we use, consisting of estimated market value of our stock, the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and volatility.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income Taxes We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	We must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net revenue .
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Net revenue increased $31.9 million, or 41.3%, to $109.3 million during 2011 from $77.3 million during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	All of the revenue growth was attributable to our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Gross profit increased $6.4 million, or 29.5%, to $27.9 million during 2011 from $21.5 million during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 25.5% during 2011 from 27.8% during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in the mix of commercial revenue, as well as lower average margins on those commercial projects.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	Gross margins for residential improved in the latter half of 2011 as compared to the prior year due to improved selling practices and lower module pricing.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Selling and operating expenses increased $6.9 million, or 41.4%, to $23.6 million during 2011 from $16.7 million during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses remained constant at 21.6% during 2011 and 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Approximately three-quarters of the increase in selling and operating expenses was due to the consolidation of Alteris, with the remainder due to increases in marketing spend, sales commissions, and travel expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	General and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million, or 48.2%, to $4.1 million during 2011 from $2.8 million during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 3.8% during 2011 from 3.6% during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	Approximately three-quarters of the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the consolidation of Alteris, with the remainder due to the addition of senior management positions.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	Acquisition-related costs were $2.4 million during 2011 and were the result of our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S7	Income tax benefit during 2011 was reduced by certain nondeductible acquisition-related costs for the Alteris acquisition that for tax purposes were capitalized into the basis of the stock investment.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S8	As a result of the above factors, net loss was $1.9 million during 2011 compared to net income of $1.2 million during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S9	Net loss per share was $0.08 during 2011 compared to net income per share of $0.07 during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S10	Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net revenue.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S11	Net revenue increased $13.0 million, or 20.2%, to $77.3 million during 2010 from $64.3 million during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S12	All the revenue growth was organic and was primarily driven by an increase in marketing and sales initiatives.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S13	Gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 34.8%, to $21.5 million during 2010 from $16.0 million during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S14	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit increased to 27.8% during 2010 from 24.8% during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S15	The increase in gross profit percentage is approximately two-thirds due to declines in solar module prices over the last year and from improved selling and installation practices.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S16	No further significant changes to the gross profit margin are anticipated.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S17	Selling and operating expenses increased $0.5 million, or 3.1%, to $16.7 million during 2010 from $16.2 million during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S18	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses decreased to 21.6% during 2010 from 25.2% during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S19	The decrease in selling and operating expenses primarily reflects the significant cost savings achieved by integrating previously acquired businesses onto a single set of systems and a unified brand.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S20	Further leveraging of the selling and operating expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, is expected as sales continue to grow.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S21	General and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 18.5%, to $2.8 million during 2010 from $2.3 million during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S22	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses remained consistent at 3.6% during each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S23	As a result of the above factors, net income was $1.2 million during 2010 compared to a net loss of $1.6 million during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S24	Net income per share was $0.07 per share during 2010 compared to a net loss of $0.09 per share during 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S25	The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations during each of the quarters in 2011 and 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S26	We believe this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the quarters presented.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P20_S27	This financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have in the past and may in the future fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our slowest installation quarter of the year.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Much of the seasonality in our business in past years has been offset by the timing of government activities as well as strong organic growth.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	With the addition of Alteris, we expect increased seasonal fluctuations due to the severity of winters in the northeast.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital needs arise from capital related to acquisitions of new businesses, working capital required to fund our purchases of solar PV modules and inverters, replacements, expansions and improvements to our infrastructure, and future growth.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	These capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including business acquisitions, the ability to attract new solar energy system installation customers, market acceptance of our product offerings, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product offerings, the level of expenditures for sales and marketing, the level of investment in support systems and facilities and other factors.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and may fluctuate from time to time and cannot accurately be predicted.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Recently we acquired Alteris, a large solar integrator, and we anticipate significant capital requirements as a result of the acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	To the extent we have or can arrange available capital, we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and other opportunities to expand our sales territories, technologies, and products and increase our sales and marketing programs as needed.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2011, and we do not presently have any plans for future material capital expenditures.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	On July 22, 2011, Alteris entered into a new financing arrangement with a bank to fund commercial solar installations.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Under a master lease agreement between a project finance subsidiary of Alteris and the bank, the project finance subsidiary may form new subsidiaries that will enter into sale leaseback arrangements with solar installation customers to finance specifically designated solar installations.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	The project finance entities will grant a security interest in substantially all their assets, and the project finance subsidiary s equity will be pledged by Alteris on a non-recourse basis to the bank.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	Alteris will provide limited unsecured guarantees of payment and performance of the obligations of the project finance entities, including operating, maintenance and indemnity obligations and payment of certain fees and expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	This financing arrangement would not generate capital for use in our business, but instead would offer a financing alternative to our commercial installation customers.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	As of December 31, 2011, there were no commercial solar installations funded under this financing arrangement.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	On December 19, 2011, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with a bank (the Loan and Security Agreement ).
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Loan and Security Agreement replaces previous credit arrangements between the bank and Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Loan and Security Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit with advances of up to $7 million based upon the collateral value of our accounts receivable.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	All borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets other than our interests in Alteris Project Financing Company LLC, and bear interest at (i) the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, plus (ii) 1.75% (or 5.75% during an event of default) unless we maintain certain liquidity benchmarks.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	The line of credit facility will mature on August 31, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	The line of credit has a facility fee of 0.5% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit during the applicable calendar quarter.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P26_S6	The borrowers may reserve up to $500,000 for stand-by letters of credit under the line of credit.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Agreement contains various covenants, including a covenant requiring compliance with a liquidity ratio defined in the Loan and Security Agreement.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The obligations may be accelerated upon an event of default, including covenant and payment defaults, material adverse change, defaults under other indebtedness giving rise to the right to accelerate payment of such indebtedness, final judgments of at least $50,000, and the borrowers insolvency or bankruptcy, among other things.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, we have guaranteed the obligations of the borrowers under the Loan and Security Agreement and collateralized our guaranty obligations by a security interest in substantially all of our assets under a separate Security Agreement, dated December 19, 2011, with the lender.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Upon the closing of the Alteris transaction on December 19, 2011, we received a commitment from Riverside Renewable Energy Investments, LLC ( Riverside ), the former majority owner of Earth Friendly Energy Holding Group, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc., to make a single cash advance to us up to $3.15 million and from Gaiam to advance us up to $1.7 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Riverside s portion of the advance commitment, which will expire on December 31, 2012, will be funded when we call the obligation and the Gaiam portion of the advance commitment was funded on December 30, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	The advances are for a period of 12 months, and bear interest at a rate of 10% if not repaid within one year from the date of advance.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Additionally, if we do not call the advance from Riverside on or prior to December 31, 2012, then Riverside will pay a fee of $170,000 in cash to Gaiam within ten days after December 31, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	However, Riverside s obligation to pay such fee to Gaiam will be nullified if we repay Gaiam s advance by June 30, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	The following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of cash during the periods presented:
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our operating activities provided net cash of $3.7 million and used net cash of $0.3 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was primarily attributable to increased accounts payable and deferred revenue and other current liabilities of $7.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, decreased accounts receivable, other current assets, and deferred costs on uncompleted contracts and advertising of $2.2 million, $1.0 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, and noncash adjustment to the net loss of $0.9 million, partially offset by increased costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $5.3 million, net loss of $1.9 million, decreased accrued liabilities of $1.5 million, and increased inventory of $0.9 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Our net cash used by operating activities during 2010 was primarily attributable to increased accounts receivable of $5.3 million and inventory of $1.6 million, partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and payable to Gaiam of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, net income of $1.2 million, noncash adjustments to our net income of $1.1 million, decreased deferred costs on uncompleted contract and advertising of $0.9 million, increased deferred revenue on uncompleted contracts of $0.5 million, and decreased other current assets of $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Our investing activities provided net cash of $3.5 million and used net cash of $0.8 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Our net cash provided by investing activities during 2011 was primarily attributable to $3.4 million of cash acquired from our acquisition of Alteris and reduction in restricted cash of $0.7 million, partially offset by the acquisition of property and equipment of $0.6 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	Our cash used in investing activities during 2010 was used to acquire property and equipment.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	Our financing activities used net cash of $6.4 million during 2011 to repay borrowings on Alteris line of credit, debt, and capital lease obligations of $5.3 million and to repurchase 379,400 shares of our Class A common stock for $1.1 million.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S7	We believe our available cash, the advance commitments from Gaiam and Riverside described above, the funds available under the bank line of credit described above and cash expected to be generated from operations should be sufficient to fund our normal business operations for the foreseeable future.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S8	Our available cash was approximately $11.8 million as of December 31, 2011, but will be reduced significantly as a result of remaining fees and other expenses related to the Alteris acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S9	Our projected cash needs may change as a result of operational difficulties, possible acquisitions, or other factors.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P29_S10	If required by our liquidity needs, we believe that we could obtain debt financing (in addition to or as a substitute for the line of credit discussed above) that would assist us in meeting our cash requirements.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In the normal course of our business, we investigate, evaluate and discuss acquisition, joint venture, noncontrolling investment, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the solar energy markets.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	For any future investment, acquisition, or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing equity securities, or incurring additional indebtedness.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	We have commitments under operating leases and various service agreements with Gaiam (see Note 8 to our notes to consolidated financial statements), but do not have any significant outstanding commitments under long-term debt obligations or purchase obligations.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	The following table shows our commitments to make future payments under our operating leases:
1425565_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	To the extent we become entitled to utilize certain loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to our initial public offering, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, May 13, 2008.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	These net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2018 if not utilized.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	As of December 31, 2011, $4.4 million of these net operating loss carryforwards remained available for current and future utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.6 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	As a condition of entering into some of our construction contracts, we had surety bonds of approximately $33.0 million at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase a significant amount of our product inventory from vendors outside of the United States in transactions that are primarily U.S. dollar denominated transactions.
1425565_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Since the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is small, currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us.
1425565_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, a decline in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies could lead to increased purchasing costs.
1425565_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In order to mitigate this exposure, we make virtually all of our purchase commitments in U.S. dollars.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Louisville, Colorado We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1425565_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	Notes to consolidated financial statements 1.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	Principles of Consolidation, Organization and Nature of Operations We are a leading residential and commercial solar energy EPC provider.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	We were incorporated in Colorado on January 29, 2008 under the name Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( Real Goods Solar , we , us , or our ).
1425565_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Our initial public offering of common stock occurred on May 7, 2008.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Real Goods Solar and its majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P7_S3	We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and they include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P7_S4	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	No changes were made to our significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2011, except for revenue recognition for fixed price energy system installation contracts, which has been incorporated into our policies below.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	The change in accounting principle for revenue recognition was applied retrospectively, and did not have and is not expected to have in the future a material impact on our financial results.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P8_S3	We have evaluated events subsequent to December 31, 2011 and concluded that no material event has occurred which either would impact the results reflected in this report or our results going forward.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Cash Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Concentration of Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We have a potential concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable in that a financing company that purchases and then leases installed solar energy system to host users and two commercial customers accounted for 20.2%, 12.8%, and 11.8%, respectively, of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S3	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S4	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.5 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P9_S5	If the financial condition of our customers or the public utilities or financing companies were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Sales to our largest three customers for 2011 accounted for approximately 20%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total net revenue.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at our various warehouses and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S4	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P10_S5	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we estimated obsolete or slow-moving inventory to be $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Prior to 2011, Gaiam, Inc. ( Gaiam ) had historically fulfilled approximately 80% of our catalog and Internet sales through its central distribution center.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	We paid Gaiam supplier product costs, order fulfillment fees, and freight charges to drop-ship these sales to our customers, which payments are made through our Intercorporate Services Agreement.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	We determined the selection of products to be offered and set the sales price.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S3	We were responsible for the selling, marketing, and providing of these products to our customers and have our own customer service department to ensure the acceptability of our products.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S4	We beared the credit risk for the amount being billed to our customer.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S5	We leveraged our multichannel distribution (web promotions and our retail outlet located at the Solar Living Center) to market slow-moving or obsolete products.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S6	Deferred Advertising Costs Prior to 2011, we had deferred advertising costs related to the preparation, printing, advertising and distribution of catalogs.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S7	We deferred such costs for financial reporting purposes until the catalogs were distributed, then amortized such costs over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated direct relationship sales.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S8	We amortized seasonal catalogs within seven months and our annual catalogs within one year.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P11_S9	Forecasted sales statistics were the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	other advertising and promotional costs as incurred.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Amounts recorded as advertising expense were $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in selling and operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	We compute depreciation of property and equipment on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	We amortize leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	We compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the enterprise level.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The annual process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	In assessing our goodwill for impairment, we use a combination of factors, including comparable company market values and multiples of revenue to the extent the information is available.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	If comparable market information is insufficient, we expect to supplement our assessment with other approaches, such as present value techniques, which will require us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P16_S4	Application of alternative assumptions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Our goodwill balances were $19.9 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and our other intangibles balances were $0.4 million and nil at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	The goodwill increase was attributable to our acquisition of Alteris during 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	The following table represents our other intangibles subject to amortization, which were all customer related, as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S3	The amortization periods range from 12 to 24 months.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S4	Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $0.2 million.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P17_S5	Based on the December 31, 2011 balance of other intangibles, we estimate amortization expense to be $0.3 million for 2012 and $0.1 million for 2013.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, reports of independent experts.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists primarily of solar energy system installation.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	As a result of a recent business acquisition (see Note 3.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), we slightly modified our method of applying revenue recognition for fixed price contracts in that we now recognize revenue from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	We recognize amounts billed to customers for postage and handling as revenue at the same time that the revenues arising from the product sale are recognized.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	We include postage and handling costs, which were approximately $0.1 million for 2011 and $0.2 million each year for 2010 and 2009, in selling and operating expense along with other fulfillment costs.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but not recognizable until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	We bill our large installation customers for contract performance progress according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Unbilled receivables were immaterial at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	Allocation of Costs Gaiam provides us with financial, audit, accounting, tax, treasury, human resources, payroll, technical and certain occupancy and related office services under Intercorporate Services and Facility Lease Agreements.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S3	Our accompanying financial statements include an allocation of these expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S4	The allocation is based on a combination of factors, including revenueand operating expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S5	We believe the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in an appropriate allocation of costs incurred by Gaiam and its subsidiaries on our behalf.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P23_S6	However, these allocations may not be indicative of the cost of future services.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Share-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	In estimating this fair value, there are certain assumptions that we use, as disclosed in Note 10.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Share-Based Compensation, consisting of the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Income Taxes We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P26_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Our effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	We have significant NOL carryforwards and more likely than not expect our deferred tax assets to be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	We have agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as we utilize certain of our NOLs in the future.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	We must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P27_S4	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S4	The result of the reassessment of our tax positions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S5	Our federal and state tax returns for all years after 2008 are subject to future examination by tax authorities for all our tax jurisdictions.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P28_S6	We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	We compute net income (loss) per share by dividing our net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares our Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	Common share equivalents of 1,262,000, 584,000 and 517,000 shares have been omitted from net income (loss) per share for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	We have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentations.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard update that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	This guidance is effective for our year beginning January 1, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions We obtained financial control, through an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), of 100% of the voting equity interests of Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc. ( Alteris ) on June 21, 2011 (the acquisition date ).
1425565_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Alteris sells, designs, installs, and supports renewable energy systems, primarily solar, for both residential and commercial customers.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Alteris has more than a dozen offices across seven states.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Our board of directors and the manager of Alteris each approved the Merger Agreement prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	On September 13, 2011 we distributed an information statement to our shareholders with respect to the execution by Gaiam, the holder of a majority of our outstanding equity, of a written consent approving the Merger Agreement.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	The acquisition closed in December 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S4	The total consideration transferred was approximately $21.7 million and was comprised of 8.7 million shares, or $21.6 million worth based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011, and $0.1 million worth of replacement share-based payment awards attributable to services rendered prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S5	Of this amount, 0.7 million shares were issued based on Alteris completion of a financing arrangement for commercial installation jobs, which we estimated, as of the acquisition date, would be completed.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S6	The consideration excludes $2.4 million of expenses that are reported as acquisition-related costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S7	In addition, the transaction had remaining contingent equity consideration of 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was contingent upon Alteris achievement of certain pre-tax income and cash flow performance targets for 2011, which was not earned.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S8	The fair value of the consideration shares was based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S9	We acquired Alteris, with its premier commercial customer experience, array of financing solutions, and strong in-house engineering expertise, to create a leading renewable energy engineering, procurement and construction provider with a strong presence on both coasts.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S10	We plan to capitalize on Alteris east coast presence and realize synergies from this acquisition by leveraging our existing infrastructure as well as by taking advantage of Alteris expertise with commercial installations.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P35_S11	These strategic benefits expected to be received largely contributed to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	With regards to our acquisition of Alteris, we have recorded $0.6 million for customer-related intangibles (20 month weighted-average useful life).
1425565_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of Alteris net assets acquired at the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	We included the results of operations from Alteris in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	Consequently, $40.9 million of revenue and $0.7 million of net income attributable to Alteris are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The following is supplemental unaudited interim pro forma information for the Alteris acquisition as if we had issued 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to acquire this business on January 1, 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	The pro forma net revenue and cost of goods sold were decreased by $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 to reflect Alteris adoption of our method, cost to cost, of measuring progress towards completion for jobs accounted for under the percentage of completion method.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Additionally, the pro forma net loss was adjusted to exclude $2.4 million of nonrecurring expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011, related to our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	Finally, pro forma net loss was adjusted by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to include amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense related to replacement stock options, both resulting from the acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S4	All pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable in order to reflect, on a supplemental pro forma basis, the impact of this acquisition on our historical financial information.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S5	During 2009, as purchase price true-up and contingent consideration related to the Regrid Power acquisition, we issued 163,504 and 200,000 shares of our Class A common stock, respectively, with an estimated combined fair value of $0.7 million and allocated the additional consideration to goodwill, which is not expected to be tax deductible.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S6	We used a period beginning two days before and two days after the date that the consideration became payable in determining the estimated fair value of the securities issued.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P38_S7	The securities were issued to a trust benefiting the former owners of Regrid Power, one of whom served as our chief executive officer for eleven months after the acquisition.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	We include results from operations of acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective effective acquisition dates.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	We have a revolving line of credit which provides for advances not to exceed $7.0 million based upon the collateral value of our accounts receivable.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	All borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets other than our interests in Alteris Project Financing Company LLC, and bear interest at (i) the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, plus (ii) 1.75% (or 5.75% during an event of default) unless we maintain certain liquidity benchmarks.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	The line of credit facility will mature on August 31, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	The line of credit has a facility fee of 0.5% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit during the applicable calendar quarter.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	We may reserve up to $500,000 for stand-by letters of credit under the line of credit.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Loan and Security Agreement establishing the line of credit contains various covenants, including a covenant requiring compliance with a liquidity ratio.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	As of December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings or stand-by letters of credit under this facility.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	Debt Our debt, all of which relates to Alteris, consisted of the following at December 31, 2011:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Notes payable to finance companies for the purchase of vehicles and equipment in 36 to 60 monthly installments totaling $23,083, including interest ranging from 0% to 11.3%.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Maturities of debt for each of the periods ended December 31st are as follows:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	The notes are subject to both positive and negative restrictions and covenants, which include maintaining certain debt service and adjusted leverage ratios.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	We have vehicles financed under capital leases.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	The cost of the capitalized leased assets included in property and equipment was $643 thousand at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	Accumulated amortization of capitalized leased assets was $109 thousand at December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	Amortization expense for capitalized leased assets was $86 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Our future minimum lease payments and capital lease obligations at December 31, 2011 are as follows:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	We lease office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from three to five years.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Until July 2011, when we relocated this portion of our operations, we leased a facility from DTTC Properties, LLC, a limited liability company partially owned by our former chief executive officer, who also was a beneficial owner of our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	This lease agreement required monthly base payments of $10,694 plus common area operating expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	Under this lease, we incurred expense of approximately $75,000, $161,000 and $158,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	On December 19, 2011, we entered into a five year facility lease with Gaiam for office space located in one of Gaiam s owned buildings in Colorado that commences January 1, 2012 and provides for monthly payment of approximately $16,300 plus common area maintenance expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S4	The following schedule represents the annual future minimum payments of all our leases at December 31, 2011:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P49_S5	We incurred rent expense of $0.5 million each year for years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Risks and Uncertainties We are subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of our business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and seasonal nature of our business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	We have accrued for probable and estimatable costs that may be incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available to us.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual costs could vary from those accruals.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Shareholders Equity and Warrants During 2011, we issued 29,408 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2008 Incentive Plan to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	On June 30, 2011, we repurchased 379,400 shares of our Class A common stock for a total cost of $1.1 million.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	We recorded this repurchase of our shares in accordance with the cost method of accounting for treasury stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	Since we have not yet decided the ultimate disposition of the re-acquired shares, their cost is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 as a $1.1 million reduction to additional paid-in capital.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	On December 19, 2011, we issued 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock as consideration for Alteris.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted its remaining 2,153,293 shares of our Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	During 2010, we issued 21,040 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2008 Incentive Plan to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2010.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	Following this issuance, Gaiam owned 54.6% of our total outstanding common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S4	For the last four years, we have valued shares issued to our independent directors at estimated fair value based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date the shares were issued, which by policy is the last trading day of each quarter in which the services were rendered.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S5	During 2009, we issued 36,112 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2008 Incentive Plan to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2009, and issued 163,504 shares of our Class A common stock as purchase price true-up and 200,000 shares of our Class A common stock as contingent consideration at a combined value of $0.7 million for a business acquired in 2008 (see Note 3.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P52_S6	Following these issuances, Gaiam owned 54.7% of our total outstanding common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Commencing at December 31, 2008, we restated our accumulated deficit and total shareholders equity balances to reflect the correction of immaterial errors with regards to income taxes for 2008.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	Accumulated deficit was increased by $364 thousand and total shareholders equity was reduced by $364 thousand.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	As part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Carlson Solar on January 1, 2008, we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	On November 1, 2007, as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Marin Solar, we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance: Each holder of our Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted all of its holdings of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock and, as a result, we have no shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	Under the terms of our articles of incorporation and merger with Alteris, we are prohibited from issuing Class B common stock in the future.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	All holders of Class A common stock vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Accordingly, Gaiam and Riverside, as the holders of 37.5% and 29.3% of the Class A common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors, respectively, may exert significant influence over the election of the directors.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the board of directors out of legally available funds.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Real Goods Solar, our Class A common stock holders are entitled to share ratably in our assets remaining after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	Holders of our Class A common stock have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Our share-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors and to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	We have two long-term incentive plans, our Real Goods Solar 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2008 Incentive Plan ) and our Real Goods Solar 2011 CEO Compensation Plan ( 2011 CEO Plan ).
1425565_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	Our 2008 Incentive Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Incentive Plan.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P58_S4	Employees, members of the board of directors, consultants, business partners, and certain key advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the Incentive Plan.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The 2011 CEO Plan only provided for the one-time granting of 600,000 options to our CEO.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	both plans are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Options vest based on performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), service conditions, or some combination thereof.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in our industry and our stock price volatility since our initial public offering.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	We primarily use historical data by participant groupings to estimate option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	The following are the variables we used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under our incentive plans for each of the years presented: The table below presents a summary of option activity under the Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2011, and changes during the year then ended: As specified under the terms of our acquisition of Alteris (see Note 3.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), upon consummation of the acquisition, options for Alteris membership units were replaced with equal in fair value options to purchase our stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	In this regard, 478,500 replacement options were granted by us at an exercise price of $2.96 per share.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	During 2009, for options previously granted under our 2008 Incentive Plan to three employees, including our president, we reset the exercise price to $2.92 per share and suspended option exercises for six months from the date of modification.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S4	The options continue to vest over their remaining original vesting periods.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S5	These modifications resulted in total incremental share-based compensation cost of approximately $20,000 during 2009 through 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S6	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1.67, $2.04 and $1.25, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S7	The total fair value of shares vested was $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million during the years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S8	Our share-based compensation cost charged against income was $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million during the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is shown in general and administrative expenses.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S9	The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.2 million for the year 2011 and $0.1 million each year for 2010 and 2009.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S10	As of December 31, 2011, there was $1.9 million of unrecognized cost related to nonvested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P66_S11	We expect that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.7 years.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Related Party Transactions We are engaged in several related party transactions with Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Gaiam is the beneficial owner of approximately 37.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	Our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, also serves as the Chairman of Gaiam and is a significant shareholder of Gaiam.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	We have and will continue to have a need for certain administrative and other services to be provided by Gaiam under our Intercorporate Services Agreement.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S3	These services may include, but are not limited to financial, audit, accounting, tax, treasury, human resources, payroll, technical, and certain occupancy and related office services as required from time to time.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S4	Additionally, we have an Industrial Building Lease with Gaiam for our corporate headquarters.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S5	We have determined that it is not cost effective to obtain and separately maintain the personnel and infrastructure associated with these services with a complement of full time, skilled employees.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S6	Services performed under this Intercorporate Services Agreement have and will be provided under our direction, and Gaiam has no power to act independently on our behalf other than as specifically authorized under the agreement or from time to time by us.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S7	Gaiam and we have and will agree on the aggregate annual amount for a particular year for the services based upon a good faith estimate of the services required for that year and the estimated fees for such services.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S8	Upon a change to the annual amounts for a particular year, the parties have and will make appropriate payments to reflect such change.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P68_S9	The annual amount and formula for various services making up the annual amount, as well as any quarterly changes, have and must be approved in writing by each of Gaiam s and our board of directors.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	During 2011, we completed a project for our Chairman to design and install an upgrade to an existing solar power system originally built in 1997 for his residence.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	The contract price or revenue recognized was $244,000, which was priced at a customary rate for work performed for employees.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	In consideration for Gaiam providing additional services under our Intercorporate Services Agreement with Gaiam and agreeing to amend our existing Intercorporate Services and the Tax Sharing Agreements with Gaiam, we expensed during 2011 additional fees payable to Gaiam of $672,000.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	Upon the closing of the Alteris transaction on December 19, 2011, we received commitments from Riverside Renewable Energy Investments, LLC ( Riverside ), who is the beneficial owner of approximately 29.3% of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, to make a single cash advance to us up to $3.15 million and from Gaiam to advance us up to $1.7 million.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	Riverside s portion of the advance commitment, which will expire on December 31, 2012, will be funded when we call the obligation and the Gaiam portion of the advance commitment was funded on December 30, 2011 and is reported as part of our payable to Gaiam on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 as we intend to repay the advance within one year.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S4	The advances are for a period of 12 months, and bear interest at a rate of 10% if not repaid within one year from the date of advance.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S5	Additionally, if we do not call the advance from Riverside on or prior to December 31, 2012, then Riverside will pay a fee of $170,000 in cash to Gaiam within ten days after December 31, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P70_S6	However, Riverside s obligation to pay such fee to Gaiam will be nullified if we repay Gaiam s advance by June 30, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Income Taxes Our provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, it was determined that we made two errors with regards to our 2008 income taxes.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	For tax purposes, we over estimated the amount of intangibles recognizable with regards to an asset purchase and impaired certain intangibles sooner than permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	To correct these immaterial to 2008 errors, we restated our net deferred tax assets (with corresponding adjustments to our accumulated deficit and total shareholders equity see Note 9.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	Shareholders Equity and Warrants), reducing the non-current net operating loss carryforward, total non-current deferred tax assets, and total net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 by $364 thousand each.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S4	At December 31, 2011, we had $1.9 million in tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S5	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, will begin to expire in 2019.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S6	Additionally, we had $5.3 million in tax effected federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P74_S7	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, begin to expire in 2018.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that limit the net operating loss available for use in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership interest.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	A change in ownership of a company of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership changes.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	Certain of our net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2011 are subject to annual limitations due to changes in ownership.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	Additionally, to the extent we become entitled to utilize certain loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to our initial public offering, we are required under the terms of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	These net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2018 if not utilized.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	As of December 31, 2011, $4.4 million of these net operating loss carryforwards remained available for current and future utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.6 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S3	We expect the remainder of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 to be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences and normal business activities in future years.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S4	Accordingly, no other valuation allowances for deferred tax items were considered necessary as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM8_P77_S5	The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2011, they have concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_12_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.
1425565_12_ITEM9B_P0_S0	2012, Erik Zech, our Chief Financial Officer, and we entered into a Separation Agreement, whereby Mr. Zech will be resigning from Real Goods Solar effective March 31, 2012.
1425565_12_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Zech will receive severance in the form of salary continuance for five weeks.
1425565_12_ITEM9B_P0_S2	We have hired a new Chief Financial Officer, John Coletta, who will begin his employment with us on March 19, 2012 with an annual salary of $250,000 and will be will be entitled to an annual bonus of up to 50% of his annual salary and stock options grants that are customary for his position.
1425565_12_ITEM10_P0_S0	pursuant to Regulation 14A. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions.

1425565_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	We trace our roots to 1978, when Real Goods Trading Corporation sold the first solar photovoltaic, or PV, panels in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P1_S5	We have designed and installed over 14,000 residential and commercial solar systems since our founding.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P1_S6	Our focused customer acquisition approach and our efficiency in converting customer leads into sales enable us to have what we believe are competitive customer acquisition costs that we continuously focus on improving.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P1_S7	We believe that our Real Goods Solar brand has a national reputation for high quality customer service in the solar energy market, which leads to a significant number of word-of-mouth referrals and new customers.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our History We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our second acquisition was Real Goods Trading Corporation, which was publicly traded from 1991 to 2001 when it was acquired by Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc., a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc. ( Gaiam ).
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	We operated essentially as a separate business (except for certain consolidated corporate functions) from 2001 to 2008, when operations were moved into our corporate entity, Real Goods Solar, Inc., upon its formation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	We acquired Marin Solar in November 2007, Carlson Solar in January 2008, Independent Energy Systems ( IES ) in August 2008, Regrid Power, Inc. ( Regrid Power ) in October 2008, and Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables, Inc. ( Alteris ) in June 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	Our goal is to continue to build on our industry-leading position and become one of the largest and most profitable residential and commercial solar energy integrators in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P2_S5	We intend to pursue the following strategies to achieve this goal:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Enhance and leverage the Real Goods Solar brand name to increase our market presence .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	We intend to enhance and leverage the Real Goods Solar brand name and our reputation for customer service to continue to win business in existing markets and to expand into new markets in which our competitors have little or no brand recognition.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Expand into markets in which legislation and government incentives are favorable for solar energy .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	We plan to expand the geographic scope of our business as jurisdictions adopt new or improve existing incentive programs that enhance the economics of solar energy systems for a broader customer base.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In addition to the $3.4 billion California Solar Initiative, or CSI, adopted in 2007, a number of states, including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, have adopted legislation and incentives favorable to solar energy and other states are considering adopting such legislation and incentives.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Federal law provides a 30% investment tax credit that was extended for eight years in 2008, when the $2,000 cap on the credit for residential systems was removed.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We believe that this tax credit will continue to stimulate the solar market on a national basis.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Consolidate the fragmented U.S. solar energy system installation market .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The U.S. solar energy system installation market remains highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent installers or integrators in California alone.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have completed a number of acquisitions as part of a consolidation strategy and although we now focus primarily on organic growth, we will continue to look at appropriate acquisition opportunities to strengthen the company and increase our market reach.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	We plan to create economies of scale in order to increase our operating efficiencies, with a goal of improving our margins and profitability.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Expand our community of customers to enhance revenue and lower our customer acquisition costs .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We intend to leverage the reputation for authenticity associated with our Real Goods Solar brand to expand our community of customers, which cares deeply about solar energy and a renewable energy lifestyle and views us as the premier solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We intend to leverage our customer base to continue to provide us with new leads and referrals, which, in conjunction with our marketing efforts, should allow us to continue to lower our customer acquisition costs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Make a difference in the world .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We intend to promote our solar energy systems as a way for individuals and communities to reduce their carbon footprint, eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign and fossil fuel-based energy sources and foster a culture of respect for the Earth and its natural resources for the benefit of future generations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Competitive Advantages We believe that we have a number of advantages over our competitors, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that our customers often buy our solar energy systems because of the strength of the Real Goods Solar brand, our longevity in the marketplace and our reputation for excellent customer service.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	As a result of over 30 years of operating in the solar energy industry, we believe that we are frequently the first company in the industry approached by new solar companies with innovative products.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	We have a highly experienced management team.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our Chief Executive Officer, Kamyar (Kam) Mofid, has a wealth of experience and expertise managing national and international organizations and has a deep knowledge of the solar sector.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition, Jirka Rysavy, non-executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, founded and grew Corporate Express from $30 million to $3 billion in revenue in less than five years, and founded Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Members of our management team, as well as Mr. Rysavy, have considerable experience in the consolidation of fragmented industries, having acquired over 250 companies.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our business model gives us a significant marketing advantage by providing us access to potential purchasers of solar energy systems from visitors to our Solar Living Center and from our strong web presence.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition, our strong brand name and reputation for outstanding customer service provide us with word-of-mouth referrals.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	We closely monitor our customer acquisitions costs and have strategies in place to continue to reduce these costs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe that as demand for electric power increases, the electric power industry will face various challenges, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Power industry at peak capacity with aging infrastructure .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	A majority of U.S. power plants in highly populated areas approach capacity during times of peak usage.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Additionally, over half of U.S. power plants are more than 30 years old.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	In order to meet the rising demand for electric power, additional plants will need to be constructed and the aging existing plant infrastructure will require significant capital investment.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Although coal, the largest non-renewable energy resource, is estimated to have over 100 years of reserves left, the rate of global energy consumption is expected to continue to increase, jeopardizing economical access to sufficient energy supply for future generations if renewable energy sources are not developed.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	As a result of aging infrastructure and high energy demand, residential and commercial customers are facing rising electricity rates, creating economic pressures for consumers and businesses alike.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Pollution and climate change concerns .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy sources, including coal, create environmental pollution, and there is significant local resistance to new coal-fired power plants in populated areas.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Concerns about climate change, global warming and greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in international efforts to reduce such emissions, and various states have enacted stricter emissions control laws or mandated that utilities comply with renewable portfolio standards ( RPS ), which require the generation of a certain amount of power from renewable sources.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	We believe that increased concerns about climate change are likely to result in increased focus on alternative energy sources.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	Because the solar energy industry offers solutions to these challenges, we believe it has extremely large growth potential.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Currently, less than one percent of the world s power is generated from solar energy sources.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Drivers of Solar Energy Industry Growth We expect a number of factors will contribute to growth in the solar energy industry, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	A number of initiatives have been enacted by the federal government and various states, municipalities and utilities that encourage or require the installation of grid-tied solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	In 1996, the state of California enabled individual energy systems to tie into the conventional utility grid and began to require that various rebates and incentives be provided to support the use of solar energy systems, making California the focus for the development of the solar energy market in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	California has mandated an increase in the percentage of renewable energy retail sales by certain utilities to 20%, with a goal of 33% by 2020.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Colorado has enacted an RPS goal of 20% for investor-owned utilities and 10% for electric cooperatives and municipal utilities serving more than 40,000 customers by 2020.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The various states in the northeast in which we operate have also implemented a variety of solar initiatives.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	As RPS programs are implemented, it is common for financial incentives to be made available, making the purchase of solar energy systems more affordable and opening additional solar markets in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Rebates offered to customers or integrators reduce the initial cost of solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Several states, including California and Colorado, require certain utilities to offer rebates that can substantially reduce the costs of installing solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	These rebates, coupled with tax credits, substantially reduce the customer s out-of-pocket cost for purchasing a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	There is currently a 30% federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar energy systems, and in October 2008 Congress extended the availability of this credit for both residential and commercial solar installations for another eight years and eliminated the $2,000 cap on the tax credit for residential installations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Other incentives, such as net metering, time-of-use credits and performance-based incentives, are provided to consumers based on the amount of electricity their solar energy systems generate.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Currently, over three quarters of the states have required some of their utility providers to accept net metering.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Net metering allows residential and small-scale commercial solar energy producers to sell excess power generated by their systems to their utility companies, through existing electric meters, at standard retail prices.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	Time-of-use metering allows customers to sell solar power to their utility for higher rates during peak times when traditional loads are at their highest demand.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	These customers can then buy back electricity from the utilities during off-peak times at a much lower rate, providing them an additional financial benefit for solar installations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Performance-based incentives, or PBIs, reward customers based on the generation of their solar energy over time, as opposed to through an initial rebate.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	In many states, the installation of a solar energy system generates a renewable energy credit, which is marketable in certain states.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	In certain jurisdictions, such as California, assessors are prohibited from increasing a solar energy system owner s property tax assessment as a result of the added value of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Benefits of solar energy systems .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Solar energy as a source of electrical power offers the following benefits compared to conventional energy sources:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The cost of electricity generated by a solar energy system is essentially fixed at the time of installation, providing a hedge against utility electricity price increases and inflation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Solar energy systems generate much of their electricity during the afternoon when the sun s rays are strongest and when the greatest demand for electricity for air conditioning occurs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Customers can use their solar energy systems energy to replace peak time conventional electricity, which can be more expensive and less reliable than electricity purchased during non-peak times.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, solar energy systems typically have low operating expenses because the systems require minimal maintenance over their expected lives.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Versatility and ease of installation .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Solar energy systems can generate electricity in any location that receives sunlight, while relatively fewer locations have both the infrastructure and natural resources required to support other forms of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind and geothermal.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Solar energy systems can be installed directly at sites where power is needed, reducing conventional electrical transmission and distribution costs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The use of solar energy systems improves energy security by reducing fossil fuel purchases from hostile or politically or economically unstable countries and by reducing power strains on local electrical transmission and distribution systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Challenges to the Solar Energy Industry We believe growth in the solar energy industry faces the following challenges:
1425565_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The decision to install a solar energy system represents a significant investment of approximately $10,000 to $30,000 or more (net of rebates and federal tax credits), if purchased outright, for the typical home.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Financing sources specifically for solar energy systems, including loans and system leases, are not always available depending upon the state and the customer s credit rating.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	The return on each customer s investment in a solar energy system will occur over a different period or at a different rate depending upon individual circumstances.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	A potential purchaser has to weigh the costs associated with the initial investment decision against the potential benefit associated with anticipated longer-term utility cost reductions, increased property value and low system maintenance costs provided by a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The solar energy industry is significantly driven by federal, state and local regulations and incentives, which are continually changing.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Changes in regulations and incentives could adversely affect the economic viability of solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Supply of solar PV modules .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	At times in recent years, there has been a global shortage of solar PV modules, which has resulted in some price increases and limited availability for solar PV modules.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	While we believe that the risk of future shortages has abated, it is always a possibility.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, other problems with the supply chain could impair the timely delivery of key system components.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Cost of traditional energy sources .
1425565_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The cost of solar power generation is often compared by customers to the cost of traditional sources of electricity generation such as coal.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Traditional power plants are relatively cheap to build but expensive to operate when the true price of their environmental impact is considered.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	Solar power plants are more expensive to build but cheaper to operate over the long-term, with minimal environmental impact.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	The growth of the solar power industry is dependent on how consumers weigh the relative importance of construction costs relative to the operating costs for both types of electricity production and the extent to which government mandates require traditional power plants to incorporate environmental costs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The challenging economic environment has created a challenging business climate for the purchase of solar systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	We believe that many customers remain interested in solar but are electing to postpone their decision to install a system until they have better visibility into the economy and their own personal financial situation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	The solar industry has been growing very rapidly and the competitive landscape has evolved.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our historically strong position, in particular in the residential sector, has been challenged by existing and new competitors.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	We must continue to improve and evolve to be able to grow profitability.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S4	We install residential and commercial systems that are generally between 3 kilowatts, or kW, and 1megawatt, or MW, output, with the average residential installation being approximately 6 kW output.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S5	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects in the 3-5 MW range.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S6	We design and build our solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S7	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average daily consumption rates in different seasons of the year to size the solar energy system and engineer its wiring.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S8	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar PV modules.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S9	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory and its rate structures and the customer s budget and preferred financing method, as well as the customer s aesthetic preferences.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S10	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates and various other factors.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S11	We assess this data using solar monitoring tools and analytical calculations, which enable us to design a solar energy system to a size and configuration that maximizes energy efficiency for each customer s circumstances.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S12	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit which is necessary for rebate processing.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P42_S13	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis and determine the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	As soon as the building permit is approved, our installation professionals begin the installation by placing metal racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the solar PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We do not custom manufacture solar PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	After the solar PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction and at the same time apply for the local utility company to interconnect the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	The entire process from signing of the contract through final inspection by the local building department typically takes between 60 to 90 days, with the actual installation work usually requiring two to three days.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	A basic solar energy system has no moving parts and consists of a number of solar PV modules wired together and mounted on a metal framing structure, an inverter and the balance of systems and safety equipment necessary to connect the system to the customer s existing utility service.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We source solar PV modules from several primary manufacturers: Canadian Solar and SunPower.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	These modules range in conversion efficiency from 14% to 16%.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Solar PV modules can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono- and poly-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide, or CIGS, and cadmium telluride.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Developments in solar PV technology have generated advances in the conversion efficiency of solar PV cells, reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in manufacturing yields.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	An inverter is an electronic device that converts the low-voltage DC power generated by solar PV modules to conventional 120-volt AC power used by standard household lights and appliances.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	While an inverter may need to be replaced approximately 15 years after installation, other system components typically do not require replacement during the 20- to 25-year warranty period applicable to solar PV modules.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Individual solar energy systems are connected to the utility grid by an inverter, which also allows the excess electricity produced to flow into the grid, causing the customer s electric meter effectively to run backwards, to the credit of the customer s utility account, sometimes at standard retail prices.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	A customer that has a grid-connected solar energy system draws energy from the grid through the conventional local utility when the sun is not shining, or when household energy consumption exceeds the solar energy system s energy generation capacity.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Warranty Terms Most manufacturers of solar PV modules currently offer a 20- to 25-year transferable warranty of their products.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	We offer a 10-year parts and labor warranty, which may also involve claims of property damage arising from the installation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	We generally handle manufacturer warranty claims for solar PV modules as part of our customer service and we are typically reimbursed by the manufacturers for our labor and materials.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	Historically, our costs associated with warranty claims have been minimal.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S4	Financing While many of our customers choose to purchase their solar energy systems without the use of financing, we also connect our customers with preferred third-party financing sources.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S5	We also work with solar financiers who lease solar systems to our customers over 10 to 20 year periods.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S6	We handle some of the administrative processing for our customers that choose to use third-party financing or leasing.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P50_S7	Loss of preferred third-party financing and leasing sources for our customers could adversely affect our business as it would reduce funding alternatives available to homeowners seeking to install a solar system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Sales and Marketing Our conventional marketing program includes presentation booths at tradeshows and consumer shows, Internet search engine optimization, pay-per-click ad words, Internet banner advertisements, affiliate marketing programs, canvassing, community involvement initiatives and customer referral programs.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	To enhance our solar energy integration business by generating leads of potential solar energy system customers and promoting our brand awareness, we operate our Solar Living Center and maintain a robust website.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our website provides pricing tools, media programming, in-depth articles and product information, and how-to instructional content.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	We also receive new customer leads from the referrals of our satisfied customers, through our customer rewards and affinity programs, from designers and architects with whom we have worked on previous projects, and through the strength and longevity of our Real Goods Solar brand name and reputation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	We believe that these attractive sources of leads lower our customer acquisition costs to below what we estimate they would be if we were to rely solely on traditional marketing methods such as print, radio, television and Internet search words.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	After we receive these high-quality leads, our inside sales representatives conduct an extensive telephone interview of the potential customer during which we determine, among other things, information about the customer s site, location, and solar exposure, and that the customer and any relevant family member or co-owner is genuinely interested in and able to finance the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S6	We use this focused customer qualification process to identify which potential customers are most likely to respond positively to our direct sales efforts before we make a site visit to the customer s location.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S7	We then utilize our direct sales force to pursue these qualified leads.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P51_S8	This qualification process further lowers our customer acquisition costs because it narrows our customer leads and allows us to focus our direct sales efforts on highly targeted customers.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We own the Real Goods Solar Living Center, which is located on a 12-acre campus in Hopland, California, approximately 95 miles north of San Francisco.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Solar Living Center is a demonstration site for the technology and culture of solar living and serves as a very effective source of qualified leads for solar installations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	In 2012, the Solar Living Center had over 150,000 visitors.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	Since it opened in 1996, more than 2.5 million people have visited the Solar Living Center, and it has become one of the largest tourist attractions in Northern California throughout the year.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our residential customers have historically shared a number of characteristics.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	They tend to be college-educated homeowners, 30 to 65 years in age, high-income earners who are generally motivated both by environmental and economic reasons to install a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our residential solar energy systems are generally 10kW or smaller in size, and our commercial solar energy systems are generally no larger than 1MW in size.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our typical residential customer is connected to the utility grid.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our commercial customers have included wineries, schools, apartment buildings, low income housing communities, churches and retail facilities.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Suppliers We do not manufacture solar PV modules, inverters or other components used in our solar energy systems, but purchase those components directly from manufacturers or, in some cases, from third-party distributors.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We purchase solar PV modules manufactured by Canadian Solar, SunPower and others.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	We purchase inverters manufactured by SMA, Enphase and others.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	We currently purchase the components used in our solar energy systems on a purchase order basis from a select group of manufacturers or suppliers.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	If we are unable to purchase from any of these sources in the future, we do not believe we would have difficulty in securing alternative supply sources, because all of the components we use in our solar energy systems are available from a number of different sources.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	With that said, the world-wide market for solar PV modules has from time to time experienced shortages of supply that have increased prices and affected availability.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	The solar energy industry is in its early stages of development and is highly fragmented, especially in the residential sector, consisting of many small, privately held companies with limited resources and operating histories but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or low overhead requirements.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	A number of competitors exist in the California market, including companies such as REC Solar, Verengo and Solar City.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Several of our competitors have expanded their market share in the California market by opening multiple offices within the state.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	We estimate that we are currently in the top ten residential solar energy system installers in California.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	In Colorado our competitors include Namaste Solar Electric, REC Solar and Solar City, but we are not aware of published data regarding competitive positions in Colorado.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S5	In the northeast, our competitors include Solar City, Sungevity, Trinity Solar and others, but we are not aware of published data regarding competitive position in that area.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P57_S6	We compete on factors such as brand recognition, quality of services and products, pricing, speed and quality of installation.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Regulations Solar integrator services are subject to oversight and regulation by national and local ordinances, including building, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection regulations, utility interconnection requirements for metering and other rules and regulations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our design and engineering teams design and install solar energy systems to comply with these varying standards as well as to minimize the installation and operating costs of each system.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	Our operations are also subject to generally applicable laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into the environment and protection of the environment; however, because our operations do not typically involve any such discharge, there are no material effects on our business relating to our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	We operate under and have registered the tradenames Real Goods , which was last renewed in 2004, and Real Goods Solar , which is pending a tradename application.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	We believe these tradenames are significant assets to our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S5	The Real Goods tradename registration is valid for ten years and we endeavor to maintain such registrations as valid and current by filing all required renewal forms when due.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P58_S6	In addition, we hold the copyright for most of the contents of the Solar Living Sourcebook.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather in certain geographic regions, especially in the northeastern parts of the country.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Much of the seasonality in the business in previous quarters has been offset by changes in government activities as well as strong organic growth.
1425565_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	As of March 22, 2013, we had approximately 334 full-time and 9 part-time employees, including installation personnel.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Government subsidies are an important economic factor in the determination to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Certain states, localities and utilities offer incentives to offset a portion of the cost of qualified solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These incentives can take many forms, including direct rebates, state tax credits, system performance payments and renewable energy credits.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	During the first quarter of 2013, Congress failed to reach a deal on balanced deficit reduction.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	As a result, the U.S. government is now subject to sequestration-automatic spending cuts aimed at reducing the U.S. federal budget cut.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	It is unclear exactly how sequestration will affect the solar energy industry in general and us in particular.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	However, it is likely to have some effect.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	For example, in March 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a 8.7% reduction in funding under the so called Section 1603 programme, which provides reimbursement of a portion of the installation expense for solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The reduction or elimination of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Adverse general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Adverse overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, spending on housing, business conditions, stock market volatility, weather conditions, acts of terrorism, threats of war, and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	While many economic indicators have improved recently, activity in many areas of the general U.S. economy remain sluggish.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If the economic conditions continue to be adverse or worsen, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The ongoing financial crisis and the loss of confidence in the stock market has increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Increases in funding costs and limitations on our access to liquidity could have a negative impact on our earnings and our ability to drive our growth strategies.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, the deteriorating general economic conditions in the United States have caused a drop in consumer spending in general, and discretionary spending in particular.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	These dynamics may also adversely impact the solar sector.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and has experienced consistent growth over the past five years.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to grow our business at the rate we desire.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A drop in the retail price of conventional energy or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional energy, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date about these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis and payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, and any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis and, as a result, our revenue from these installations is driven by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although we generally build payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments could adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Existing regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that could deter purchases of solar energy systems and investment in the research and development of solar energy technology.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Without a mandated regulatory exception for solar energy systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Such fees could increase the cost to our customers of using solar energy systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rates rather than with the less expensive average price of electricity.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate, would require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant market share.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from our solar energy integration services from sales in west coast and northeast states.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from solar energy integration services from projects in fewer than ten states located on the west coast and in the northeast.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business plan and proposed strategy have not been independently evaluated.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have not obtained any independent evaluation of our business plan and proposed business strategy.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There can be no assurance that our business plan and proposed strategy will generate sufficient revenues to maintain profitability.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our success may depend in part on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As part of our business strategy, we may expand our operations through strategic acquisitions in our current markets and in new geographic markets.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We acquired several businesses over the last few years.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These risks, as well as other circumstances that often accompany expansion through acquisitions, could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the size, timing and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Consequently, our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our failure to integrate the operations of acquired businesses successfully into our operations or to manage our anticipated growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We must integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that leverage our revenue and growth opportunities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The integration of the management, operations, and facilities of acquired businesses with our own could involve difficulties, which could adversely affect our growth rate and operating results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We may be unable to complete effectively the integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; to manage efficiently the combined operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; to achieve our operating, growth and performance goals for acquired businesses; to achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or to achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Our rate of growth and operating performance may suffer if we fail to manage acquired businesses profitably without substantial additional costs or operational problems or to implement effectively combined growth and operating strategies.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S10	We may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs and the size, timing and structure of future acquisitions.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Any borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on future borrowings.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S13	If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S14	In addition, our operations may not generate sufficient cash for our acquisition plans.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S15	The extent to which we would be able or willing to use our equity to consummate future acquisitions will depend on the market price of our equity from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept our equity as full or partial payment.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S16	Using our equity for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our shareholders.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S17	To the extent that we are unable to use our equity to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose through debt or equity financings.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P21_S18	The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As of March 28, 2013, we had indebtedness of approximately $14.1 million.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	additional loans of $1.0 million from each of Gaiam and Riverside, pursuant to the loan commitment entered into on November 13, 2012, for our general working capital needs.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	capital lease obligations and miscellaneous debt financing of $0.7 million with various maturity dates.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet our long-term debt service obligations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As illustrated above, during 2013, $6.5 million of our indebtedness will become due and payable.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or new sources of credit in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements and our debt service requirements may increase significantly.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain capital to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our failure to meet our debt service obligations or pay our indebtedness when it comes due may cause us to become insolvent, which would cast doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	make payments on or amend any subordinated obligations Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Further, the expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S8	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S9	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S10	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S11	Our success depends on the value of our Real Goods Solar brand.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S12	We depend on the name recognition of our Real Goods Solar brand in our marketing efforts.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S13	Maintaining and building recognition of our brand are important to expanding our customer base.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S14	If the value of our brand were adversely affected, our ability to attract customers would be negatively impacted and our growth could be impaired.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S15	Our failure to protect our brands may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our brands or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S16	We believe that it is important for our business to achieve brand recognition.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S17	We rely primarily on tradenames to achieve this.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S18	Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S19	In addition, policing unauthorized use of our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property can be difficult and expensive.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S20	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S21	We cannot give assurance that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S22	Such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend our other resources away from our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S23	An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects, and reputation.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S24	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S25	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S26	Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S27	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P29_S28	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our solar energy systems and our inability to purchase components would adversely affect our results of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We rely on third-party suppliers for components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	During 2012, Canadian Solar accounted for over 78% of our purchases of solar PV modules, and PV Powered and Enphase accounted for over 73% of our purchases of inverters.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The failure of our suppliers to supply us with components in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules and harm our operating results and business expansion efforts.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Our orders with certain of our suppliers may represent a very small portion of their total business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	As a result, these suppliers may not give priority to our business, leading to potential delays in or cancellation of our orders.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	If any of our suppliers were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, historically, shortages have occurred and have impacted companies such as us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Shortages of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar PV modules we use in our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Manufacturers of solar PV modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar PV modules.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Shortages of silicon or inverters cause the prices for solar PV modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar PV modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We install solar energy systems, and many factors could prevent us from completing installations as planned, including the escalation of construction costs beyond increments anticipated in our installation budgets.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Solar installations have certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical and mechanical malfunction.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, our projects entail additional risks related to structural heights.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our installation projects also entail significant risks, including:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	increases in the cost of solar panels and other products used in our installations, including as a result of unfair trade duties described elsewhere in these risk factors, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our construction and installation projects.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of market share or reduced margins.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and fragmented with low barriers to entry.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We currently compete with a large number of relatively small installers and integrators, some of which do not have extensive industry experience and may lack adequate systems and capital, but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As the solar energy industry expands and industry consolidation occurs, we will also more and more encounter competition from larger companies, some of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	An increase in pricing structures of our third party financing partners could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Many of our customers depend on third party lease financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase our solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Third-party financing sources for solar energy systems are currently limited, and due to the limited sources, they have significant leverage and control over the terms and pricing for their financing products.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S6	If our financing partners increase their pricing structure, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S7	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S8	An increase in the pricing structures of our third party financing partners likely will have a negative effect on our results of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S11	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S13	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S14	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S15	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S16	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S17	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S18	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S19	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a 10-year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P40_S20	In addition, most manufacturers of solar PV modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims and we have not had material warranty claims in the past, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial condition.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	We must meet the NASDAQ Global Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As of February 21, 2013, we had regained compliance with all applicable NASDAQ rules.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	There can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the continued listing requirements for the NASDAQ Capital Market, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In the event the make-up of our Board of Directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the NASDAQ Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our Board of Directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our Board of Directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Finally, if the composition of our Board of Directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, as further described in the previous risk factor.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S7	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P43_S8	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Because the last reported trade of our company stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was at a price below $5.00 per share, our Class A common stock is currently considered a penny stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s agreement to the transaction.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our Class A common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our Class A common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Accordingly, shareholders would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Securities analysts may not continue to cover our Class A common stock, and this may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock s market price.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we are covered by securities analysts, and our stock is downgraded, our stock price would likely decline.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If the analyst ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Ownership could be diluted by future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock or the exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants or convertible notes to purchase capital stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In particular, we may sell securities in the future in order to finance operations, expansions, or particular projects or expenditures.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Such issuances would have a significant dilutive effect.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our Class A common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol RSOL.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance of any liquidity or resale value of our Class A common stock, and shareholders may be required to hold shares of our Class A common stock for an indefinite period of time.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Risk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam and Riverside Gaiam and Riverside have significant influence over Real Goods Solar and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Gaiam and Riverside hold approximately 37% and 29%, respectively, of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Their respective ownership may increase, stay the same or decrease depending on the amount of shares of Class A common stock we issue in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Gaiam and Riverside currently each has the right to designate two individuals for appointment or nomination to our Board of Directors and they have agreed to vote their securities in favor of the election to our Board of Directors of these designated individuals.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Because of their voting rights and their ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our Board of Directors, each of them will be able to exert significant influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares available for issuance under the Real Goods Solar 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our Chairman of our Board of Directors, Jirka Rysavy, who is also the Chairman of Gaiam, currently owns approximately 27% of the outstanding equity, and in excess of 50% of the voting power, of Gaiam and is one of two individuals designated by Gaiam to serve on our Board of Directors.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Gaiam and Riverside are not prohibited from selling a significant interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Gaiam and Riverside did not maintain voting significance over us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Our historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S8	Our historical financial information for periods prior to our initial public offering do not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S9	The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S10	These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S11	The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented or will be in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S12	We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S13	Our inability to resolve any disputes that arise between us and Gaiam with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may result in a reduction of our revenue, and such disputes may also result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P51_S14	Disputes may arise between Gaiam and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including the following:
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	business opportunities that may be attractive to both Gaiam and us.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, we have indemnification obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Intercorporate Services Agreement, Facility Lease Agreement and Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement with Gaiam, and disputes between us and Gaiam may result in claims for indemnification.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	However, we do not currently expect that these indemnification obligations will materially affect our potential liability compared to what it would be if we did not enter into these agreements with Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Some of our directors may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Gaiam common stock, options to acquire Gaiam common stock and positions with Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Some of our directors own Gaiam Class A common stock and options to purchase Gaiam Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S6	In addition, some of our directors are also directors and/or executive officers of Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Ownership of Gaiam Class A common stock and options to purchase Gaiam Class A common stock by our directors and the presence of directors and executive officers of Gaiam on our Board of Directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	renewable energy sources, energy efficiency or energy use reduction.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	However, we understand that Gaiam does not intend to acquire businesses that are focused on solar energy.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We have not established at this time any procedural mechanisms to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest of these directors and officers and expect that our Board of Directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, will determine how to address any actual or perceived conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If any corporate opportunity arises and if our directors and officers do not pursue it on our behalf, we may not become aware of, and may potentially lose, a significant business opportunity.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Possible future sales of shares by Gaiam or Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Gaiam or Riverside may sell any or all of the shares of Class A common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement among Gaiam, Riverside and us, entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Gaiam and Riverside have the right to require us to register the shares of Class A common stock that they own to facilitate the possible sale of such shares.
1425565_13_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Gaiam or Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	offices are located in Louisville, Colorado.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Hopland, California property is also the location of a 12-acre Solar Living Center.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities:
1425565_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 3 months to 4 years.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that suitable additional facilities will be available for lease or purchase when, and as, we need them.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	As further discussed in Note 8.
1425565_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	Related Party Debt, pursuant to the terms of two $1.0 million loans owed to Gaiam and Riverside, respectively, if we fail to make payment of the principal and all interest owing one or both of these loans within 10 days of when due, then the creditor has the option to acquire an undivided 50% interest in our Hopland, California property in exchange for cancellation of such principal and interest, subject to (1) the approval of the transaction by our disinterested directors, and (2) the consent of our senior creditor, Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Stock Price History Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol RSOL .
1425565_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 22, 2013, we had 45 shareholders of record and 26,707,736 shares of $.0001 par value Class A common stock and no shares of $.0001 par value Class B shares outstanding.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth certain sales price and trading volume data for our Class A common stock for the periods indicated: Dividend Policy We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	Our revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank prohibits the payment of dividends.
1425565_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	The following table summarizes equity compensation plan information for our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2012:
1425565_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	should read the following selected consolidated financial data together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 from our audited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in this Form 10-K. The consolidated financial data includes the effects of our acquisitions from the date of those transactions.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Gaiam expenses, including costs of fulfillment, customer service, financial and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	The expense allocations are based on what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	Income tax expenses were calculated on the separate return approach.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	The historical financial data in our audited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows will be in the future, or, with respect to periods prior to our initial public offering, what such results would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(a) We restated 2008 to reflect the correction of immaterial errors with regards to income taxes.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	Income tax benefit was reduced and net loss was increased by $364 thousand, and net loss per share increased by $0.03.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	We restated total assets and total shareholders equity to reflect the correction of immaterial errors with regards to income taxes for 2008.
1425565_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	Commencing with 2008, total assets and total shareholders equity were each reduced by $364 thousand.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K. Overview We are a leading provider of turnkey commercial and residential solar energy solutions, with more than 14,000 solar systems in place.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also have more than 33 years of experience in solar energy, beginning with the sale in 1978 of the first solar PV panels in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	With 15 offices across the West and the Northeast, we are one of the larger solar energy installers in the U.S. in the residential and commercial sectors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	However, there are market participants, especially in the utility-size solar systems, who are much larger than us.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	Our revenue primarily results from the installation of solar energy systems.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S7	We also derive a portion of our revenue from the retail sale of renewable energy products.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S8	Our expenses primarily consist of labor costs incurred in connection with solar installations, product costs for solar modules and other products sold, and related sales and marketing and back-office costs.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S9	During 2012, we completed the integration of Alteris and centralized key operating functions at our corporate head office in Louisville, Colorado.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S10	We have significantly invested in operating expenses and working capital toward such efforts.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P0_S11	We believe that this will result in an efficient and scalable infrastructure that can be leveraged to expand our depth and breath of capabilities, in both the residential and the commercial sectors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	While the solar manufacturing industry has struggled based on oversupply and global pricing competition, downstream distributed solar power integrators have benefited from reduced costs.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Financing companies have entered the market to enable compelling financing terms for homeowners and businesses, including no money down leasing.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We continue to expect strong demand for both residential and commercial solar installations, despite the overall economic weakness in the United States.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	As one of the few solar installers with a relatively strong national footprint (in solar-friendly states), we expect to capitalize on our expanded footprint and the evolving U.S. solar industry.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions Marin Solar, Inc.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	On November 1, 2007, we purchased 100% ownership of Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	As additional consideration we granted to the sellers warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	The warrants have a seven year term and were still outstanding at December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 1, 2008, our then 88.4% owned subsidiary acquired certain of the assets of and assumed certain liabilities from Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	As part of the acquisition, as additional consideration, we granted warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share, which vested 50% upon our initial public offering.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Following such initial vesting, 2% of the warrants will vest each month thereafter.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	The warrants have a seven year term.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The assets acquired were determined to have all inputs and processes necessary for the transferred assets to continue to conduct normal operations after acquisition; accordingly, the purchase price was treated as a business combination.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	On May 23, 2008, we exchanged 280,000 shares of our Class A common stock for our then current Chief Financial Officer s 11.6% ownership in Real Goods Carlson Inc.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	The warrants have a seven year term and were still outstanding at December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	On August 1, 2008, we acquired 100% ownership of IES for $3.3 million in cash and $0.3 million worth of our Class A common stock, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.2 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	closing adjustments, plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $0.3 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	During 2009, as purchase price true-up and contingent consideration related to this acquisition, we issued 163,504 shares and 200,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A common stock with an estimated combined fair value of $0.7 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables We obtained financial control, through an Agreement and Plan of Merger, of 100% of the voting equity interests of Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables on June 21, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The total consideration transferred was approximately $21.7 million and was comprised of 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $21.6 million based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011, and $0.1 million worth of replacement share-based payment awards attributable to services rendered prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists primarily of solar energy system installation fees.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed contract or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	As a result of a recent business acquisition (see Note 3.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), we slightly modified our method of applying revenue recognition for fixed price contracts in that we now recognize revenue from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness, and current economic trends.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located in various warehouse facilities and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the Company level.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	We have the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying amount.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	If it is determined that the fair value of the Company is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	If it is determined that the two-step impairment test is necessary, then for step one, we compare the estimated fair value of the Company with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, we consider the Company s goodwill not impaired.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	We use either a comparable market approach, traditional present value method, or some combination thereof to test for potential impairment.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, independent expert appraisals.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	In calculating this fair value, there are certain highly subjective assumptions that we use, consisting of estimated market value of our stock, the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and volatility.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income Taxes We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	We must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Net revenue .
1425565_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Net revenue decreased $16.4 million, or 15.0%, to $92.9 million during 2012 from $109.3 million during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the direct supplying to customers by financing companies of certain components used in residential installation.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Sourcing of such components in conjunction with the associated financing allowed residential customers to take advantage of certain expiring tax benefits, and are referred to as safe harbor installations and amounted to $9.6 million in 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	While we recognize lower revenue from safe harbor installations, our gross margins are similar to non-safe harbor installations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, revenue from commercial customer installations declined by approximately $6.0 million due to a lower average sales price per watt installed.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Gross profit decreased $4.8 million, or 17.3%, to $23.0 million during 2012 from $27.9 million during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 24.8% during 2012 from 25.5% during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The decrease in gross profit was due to a higher proportion of commercial installations, which have lower gross profit margins than residential installations, as well as lower year over year average margins on those commercial installations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	Selling and operating expenses increased $6.2 million, or 26.1%, to $29.8 million during 2012 from $23.6 million during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses increased to 32.1% during 2012 from 21.6% during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P22_S7	The increase in selling and operating expenses is attributable to costs associated with the integration of Alteris that resulted in the centralization of functions in our Colorado corporate head office.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	General and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million, or 116.8%, to $8.9 million during 2012 from $4.1 million during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 9.6% during 2012 from 3.8% during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to investments in our Louisville, Colorado head office, in management and leadership talent, and in shared services personnel subsequent to the Alteris merger, and executive recruiting fees.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	Acquisition-related costs were $2.4 million during 2011 and were the result of our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	Goodwill and other asset impairments were $22.0 million for 2012 and were comprised of noncash impairment charges of $19.7 million for goodwill, $2.1 million for property and equipment, and $0.2 million for other intangibles.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We estimated the fair value of our business for the intangibles impairment analysis based on the quoted market price for our Class A common stock (level one input of the fair value hierarchy), as adjusted by our judgmental qualitative factors (level three of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The impairment of our property and equipment was based on market place property comparables (level two of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	These noncash impairments were necessitated by the trading price of our Class A common stock, recent operating losses, and our financial forecasts.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Income tax expense was $8.7 million for 2012 and includes a $16.1 million noncash charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $47.2 million, or $1.77 per share, during 2012 compared to $1.9 million, or $0.08 per share, during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net revenue .
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S6	Net revenue increased $31.9 million, or 41.3%, to $109.3 million during 2011 from $77.3 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S7	All of the revenue growth was attributable to our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S8	Gross profit increased $6.4 million, or 29.5%, to $27.9 million during 2011 from $21.5 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S9	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 25.5% during 2011 from 27.8% during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S10	The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in the mix of commercial revenue, as well as lower average profit margins on those commercial projects.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S11	Gross margins for residential improved in the latter half of 2011 as compared to the prior year due to improved selling practices and lower module pricing.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S12	Selling and operating expenses increased $6.9 million, or 41.4%, to $23.6 million during 2011 from $16.7 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S13	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses remained constant at 21.6% during 2011 and 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S14	Approximately three-quarters of the increase in selling and operating expenses was due to the consolidation of Alteris, with the remainder due to increases in marketing spend, sales commissions, and travel expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S15	General and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million, or 48.2%, to $4.1 million during 2011 from $2.8 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S16	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 3.8% during 2011 from 3.6% during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S17	Approximately three-quarters of the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the consolidation of Alteris, with the remainder due to the addition of senior management positions.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S18	Acquisition-related costs were $2.4 million during 2011 and were the result of our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S19	Income tax benefit during 2011 was reduced by certain nondeductible acquisition-related costs for the Alteris acquisition that for tax purposes were capitalized into the basis of the stock investment.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S20	As a result of the above factors, net loss was $1.9 million during 2011 compared to net income of $1.2 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P24_S21	Net loss per share was $0.08 during 2011 compared to net income per share of $0.07 during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations during each of the quarters in 2012 and 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	We believe this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the quarters presented.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	This financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	(a) The quarter ended September 30, 2012 includes a noncash charge of $22.0 million for the impairment of goodwill and other assets and a noncash charge of $14.5 million for the establishment of a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	(b) The quarter ended December 31, 2012 includes a noncash charge of $1.6 million for an additional valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets generated during that quarter.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have in the past and may in the future fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our slowest installation quarter of the year.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Much of the seasonality in our business in past years has been offset by the timing of government activities as well as strong organic growth.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	With the addition of Alteris, we expect increased seasonal fluctuations due to the severity of winters in the northeast.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital needs arise from capital related to acquisitions of new businesses, working capital required to fund our purchases of solar PV modules and inverters, replacements, expansions and improvements to our infrastructure, and future growth.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	These capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including business acquisitions, the ability to attract new solar energy system installation customers, market acceptance of our product offerings, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product offerings, the level of expenditures for sales and marketing, the level of investment in support systems and facilities and other factors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	The timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and may fluctuate from time to time.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	To the extent we have or can arrange available capital, we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and other opportunities to expand our sales territories, technologies, and products and increase our sales and marketing programs as needed.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2012, and we do not presently have any plans for future material capital expenditures.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	On July 22, 2011, Alteris entered into a new financing arrangement with a bank to fund commercial solar installations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Under a master lease agreement between a project finance subsidiary of Alteris and the bank, the project finance subsidiary may form new subsidiaries that will enter into sale leaseback arrangements with solar installation customers to finance specifically designated solar installations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The project finance entities will grant a security interest in substantially all their assets, and the project finance subsidiary s equity will be pledged by Alteris on a non-recourse basis to the bank.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Alteris will provide limited unsecured guarantees of payment and performance of the obligations of the project finance entities, including operating, maintenance and indemnity obligations and payment of certain fees and expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	This financing arrangement would not generate capital for use in our business, but instead would offer a financing alternative to our commercial installation customers.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	As of December 31, 2012, there were no commercial solar installations funded under this financing arrangement.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	On March 27, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiaries Real Goods Energy Tech, Inc., a Colorado corporation, Real Goods Trading Corporation, a California corporation, and Alteris Renewables, Inc., a Delaware corporation, entered into a Third Loan Modification Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the Loan Agreement Amendment ) pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed to certain amendments to the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2011, among them (as amended by the First Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2012, and the Second Loan Modification and Reinstatement Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2012, and together with the Loan Agreement Amendment, the Loan Agreement ).
1425565_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Under the Loan Agreement, the amount of available credit under the revolving line of credit is $6.5 million, subject to the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 75% of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Loan Agreement).
1425565_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Loan Amendment extended the maturity date from March 31, 2013 to September 30, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Loan Agreement provides for an interest rate on borrowings of the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, plus 4.75%.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The interest rate accruing on borrowings during a Streamline Period (as defined in the Loan Agreement) increased from the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, to the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, plus 2.00%.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	As amended, the Loan Agreement now requires the borrowers to pay a final payment fee of $60 thousand in cash upon termination or maturity of the revolving line of credit.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	The final payment fee will be reduced to $40 thousand if we raise at least $3.0 million in net proceeds through a public offering of our Class A common stock prior to August 31, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	The borrowers paid Silicon Valley Bank a $60,000 extension fee and agreed to reimburse the bank for certain expenses incurred in connection with entering into the Loan Agreement Amendment.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S5	Upon the closing of the Alteris transaction on December 19, 2011, we received commitments from Riverside to make us a single loan of up to $3.15 million and from Gaiam to loan us up to $1.7 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S6	Gaiam funded its loan commitment on December 30, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S7	Riverside loaned us $3.0 million on May 4, 2012 and another $150 thousand on June 20, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S8	The loans originally were for a period of 12 months.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S9	The maturity dates for these loans have been extended and Gaiam s $1.7 million loan is now due April 30, 2014, Riverside s $3.0 million loan is due May 4, 2014 and Riverside s $150 thousand loan is due June 20, 2014.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S10	The loans bear interest at a rate of 10%.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S11	If we repay the loans owed to Riverside on or before their respective maturity date, the accrued interest is waived.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S12	On November 13, 2012, we entered into a Loan Commitment with Gaiam and Riverside pursuant to which each agreed to advance to us up to an additional $1.0 million in cash upon request from us until March 31, 2013 at an annual interest rate of 10% and with an original maturity date of April 26, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S13	The maturity date for these loans has been extended until April 26, 2014.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S14	During December 2012, we requested and received an advance of $1.0 million from each of Gaiam and Riverside under the Loan Commitment.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S15	Further, the Loan Commitment also required us to execute and deliver to Gaiam in the near future an option agreement, reasonably acceptable to both parties, permitting Gaiam to purchase for $0.2 million all tenant improvements constructed by us in our principal office space leased by us from Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S16	In addition, we agreed to amend our lease to cancel, effective December 31, 2012, the $3 per square foot credit set forth in the current lease.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P35_S17	The loans from Gaiam and Riverside are subordinate to all indebtedness for borrowed money owed by us to any lenders unaffiliated with us.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Payment of the unpaid principal and all accrued but unpaid interest under a loan is accelerated and become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events related to proceedings under bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar laws, the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for our company or a substantial part of our assets, and our making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Gaiam owns approximately 37% of our Class A common stock and is one of our creditors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Riverside owns approximately 29% of our Class A common stock and is one of our creditors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Pursuant to the terms of a Shareholders Agreement, Gaiam and Riverside each has the right to designate a certain number of individuals for appointment or nomination to our Board of Directors, tied to their respective ownership of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	At December 31, 2012, our cash balance was $10.4 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of cash during the periods presented: Operating activities .
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our operating activities used net cash of $12.7 million and provided net cash of $2.0 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Our net cash used by operating activities during 2012 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $47.2 million, decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $12.1 million, and decreased deferred revenue and other current liabilities of $2.0 million, partially offset by noncash impairment of intangibles of $22.0 million, deferred income tax benefit of $8.7 million, decreased accounts receivable of $7.6 million and decreased inventory of $6.6 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was primarily attributable to increased accounts payable and deferred revenue and other current liabilities of $7.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, decreased accounts receivable, other current assets, and deferred costs on uncompleted contracts and advertising of $2.2 million, $1.0 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, and noncash adjustment to the net loss of $0.9 million, partially offset by increased costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $5.3 million, decreased payable to Gaiam of $2.1 million, net loss of $1.9 million, decreased accrued liabilities of $1.5 million, and increased inventory of $0.9 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Our investing activities used net cash of $0.02 million and provided net cash of $3.5 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	Our net cash used by investing activities during 2012 was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment for $0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $0.2 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S6	Our net cash provided by investing activities during 2011 was primarily attributable to $3.4 million of cash acquired from our acquisition of Alteris and reduction in restricted cash of $0.7 million, partially offset by the acquisition of property and equipment of $0.6 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S7	Our financing activities provided net cash of $11.3 million and used net cash of $4.7 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S8	Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was primarily the result of borrowings on our line of credit of $6.5 million and loans from related parties of $5.15 million, partially offset by payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $0.4 million.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P37_S9	Our net cash used by financing activities during 2011 was primarily used to repay borrowings on Alteris line of credit, debt, and capital lease obligations of $5.3 million and to repurchase 379,400 shares of our Class A common stock for $1.1 million, partially offset by a $1.7 million loan from Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the normal course of our business, we investigate, evaluate and discuss acquisition, joint venture, non-controlling investment, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the solar energy markets.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	For any future investment, acquisition, or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing equity securities, or incurring additional indebtedness.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	While there can be no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, cash raised through debt commitments, cash expected to be generated from operations, cash obtainable from additional investors, and cash savings through further operational efficiencies should be sufficient to fund our continuing operations and meet our current debt repayment obligations through at least calendar year 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	However, our projected cash needs may change as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or other factors.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	In response to our current financial condition, we are negotiating with other financial institutions to obtain a new credit facility to replace the Silicon Valley Bank revolving line of credit and have engaged an investment bank to seek additional capital.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	In addition, we will continue to make operational improvements to reduce our operating cash requirements.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	Operational initiatives to reduce costs include productivity enhancements within support functions through greater use of information technology and other process improvements and greater project level control over working capital deployed and labor utilization.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S7	With the completion of the debt extensions and additional loans and achievement of some or all of the above noted remaining initiatives, while there can be no assurances, we expect to be able to continue to operate through 2013, and thereby generate adequate cash flow to meet our debt obligations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S8	We have commitments under operating leases and various service agreements with Gaiam (see Notes 7 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements), but do not have any significant outstanding commitments under long-term debt obligations or purchase obligations.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P38_S9	The following table shows our commitments to make future payments under our operating leases:
1425565_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	To the extent we become entitled to utilize certain loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to our initial public offering, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, May 13, 2008.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2018 if not utilized.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	As of December 31, 2012, $4.4 million of these net operating loss carryforwards remained available for current and future utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.6 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a condition of entering into some of our construction contracts, we had surety bonds of approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase a significant amount of our product inventory from vendors outside of the United States in transactions that are primarily U.S. dollar denominated transactions.
1425565_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Since the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is small, currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us.
1425565_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	However, a decline in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies could lead to increased purchasing costs.
1425565_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In order to mitigate this exposure, we make virtually all of our purchase commitments in U.S. dollars.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Louisville, Colorado We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1425565_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Notes to consolidated financial statements 1.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Principles of Consolidation, Organization and Nature of Operations We are a leading residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	We were incorporated in Colorado on January 29, 2008 under the name Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( Real Goods Solar , Company , we , us , or our ).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Our initial public offering of common stock occurred on May 7, 2008.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Real Goods Solar and its majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and they include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P7_S4	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Debt Financing Update At December 31, 2012, our cash balance was $10.4 million.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	As of the date of filing this Form 10-K, the maturity date for our Silicon Valley Bank revolving line of credit with current capacity and outstanding borrowings of $6.5 million has been extended first from October 30, 2012 to March 31, 2013, and then to September 30, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	Our related party debt of $1.7 million owed to Gaiam, Inc. has been extended first from December 30, 2012 to April 30, 2013, and then to April 30, 2014. .
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S4	Our related party debt of 3.15 million owed to Riverside Renewable Energy Investment LLC ( Riverside ) has also been extended and the $3.0 million Riverside loan is now due May 4, 2014 and the $150 thousand Riverside loan is now due June 20, 2014.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S5	We also obtained additional loans of $1.0 million each from our two largest shareholders, which mature on April 26, 2014 under their current terms.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S6	Furthermore, in response to our current financial condition, we are negotiating with other financial institutions to obtain a new credit facility to replace the Silicon Valley Bank revolving line of credit and have engaged an investment bank to seek additional capital.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S7	In addition, we will continue to make operational improvements to reduce our operating cash requirements.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S8	Operational initiatives to reduce costs include productivity enhancements within support functions through greater use of information technology and other process improvements and greater project level control over working capital deployed and labor utilization.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P8_S9	With the completion of the debt extensions and additional loans and achievement of some or all of the above noted remaining initiatives, while there can be no assurances, we expect to be able to continue to operate through 2013, and thereby generate adequate cash flow to meet our debt obligations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	NASDAQ Non-Compliance During 2012, we received four different non-compliance notices from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( NASDAQ ).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	As of February 21, 2013, the Company had regained compliance with all of the applicable NASDAQ rules.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	No changes were made to our significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P9_S3	We have evaluated events subsequent to December 31, 2012 and concluded that no material event, other than those already disclosed, has occurred which either would impact the results reflected in this report or our results going forward.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Cash Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	If the financial condition of our customers or the public utilities or financing companies were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at our various warehouses and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P12_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we estimated obsolete or slow-moving inventory to be $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Deferred Advertising Costs Prior to 2011, we had deferred advertising costs related to the preparation, printing, advertising and distribution of catalogs.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	periods on the basis of estimated direct relationship sales.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	We amortized seasonal catalogs within seven months and our annual catalogs within one year.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	Forecasted sales statistics were the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	We expense other advertising and promotional costs as incurred.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Amounts recorded as advertising expense were $3.4 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in selling and operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	We compute depreciation of property and equipment on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	We amortize leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the Company level.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P17_S3	We have the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying amount.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P17_S4	If it is determined that the fair value of the Company is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	If it is determined that the two-step impairment test is necessary, then for step one, we compare the estimated fair value of the Company with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, we consider the Company s goodwill not impaired.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	We use either a comparable market approach, traditional present value method, or some combination thereof to test for potential impairment.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	Our goodwill balances were zero and $19.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and our other intangibles balances were zero and $0.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The following table represents our other intangibles subject to amortization, which were all customer related, as of December 31, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P20_S4	Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.2 million.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	At September 30, 2012, we impaired all our goodwill and other intangibles.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, reports of independent experts.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P21_S3	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists primarily of solar energy system installation.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed contract or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	As a result of a recent business acquisition (see Note 3.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), we slightly modified our method of applying revenue recognition for fixed price contracts in that we now recognize revenue from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	We recognize amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling as revenue at the same time that the revenues arising from the product sale are recognized.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	We include shipping and handling costs, which were approximately $0.05 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, in selling and operating expense along with other fulfillment costs.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but not recognizable until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	We bill our large installation customers for contract performance progress according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Unbilled receivables were immaterial at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	Allocation of Costs Presently, Gaiam provides us with administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and certain occupancy and related office services under the Intercorporate Services Agreement and the Facility Lease Agreement.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S3	Our accompanying financial statements include an allocation of these expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S4	The allocation is based on a combination of factors, including revenue and operating expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S5	We believe the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in an appropriate allocation of costs incurred by Gaiam and its subsidiaries on our behalf.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P26_S6	However, these allocations may not be indicative of the cost of future services.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Share-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	In estimating this fair value, there are certain assumptions that we use, as disclosed in Note 13.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Share-Based Compensation, consisting of the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Income Taxes We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Our effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	We have significant net operating loss carryforwards and we will re-evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether we expect it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	We have agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as we utilize certain of our net operating losses in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	We must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P30_S4	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S4	The result of the reassessment of our tax positions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S5	Our federal and state tax returns for all years after 2008 are subject to future examination by tax authorities for all our tax jurisdictions.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P31_S6	We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	We compute net income (loss) per share by dividing our net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares our Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	Weighted average common share equivalents of 2,173,000, 1,262,000 and 584,000 shares have been omitted from net income (loss) per share for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Concentration of Risk We have a potential concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable in that two financing companies that purchase and then lease installed solar energy system to host users and two commercial customers accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, 17.5% and 11.1% respectively, of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	We also have potential concentration of supply risk in that during 2012 we purchase approximately 78% of the major components for our solar installations from a single supplier.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	Sales to our largest three customers for 2012 accounted for approximately 15.8%, 12.4% and 7.2%, respectively, of our total net revenue.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	We have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions We obtained financial control, through an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), of 100% of the voting equity interests of Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables ( Alteris ) on June 21, 2011 (the acquisition date ).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Alteris sells, designs, installs, and supports renewable energy systems, primarily solar, for both residential and commercial customers.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Alteris has more than a dozen offices across seven states.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our Board of Directors and the manager of Alteris each approved the Merger Agreement prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	On September 13, 2011 we distributed an information statement to our shareholders with respect to the execution by Gaiam, the holder of a majority of our outstanding equity, of a written consent approving the Merger Agreement.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	The acquisition closed in December 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S4	The total consideration transferred was approximately $21.7 million and was comprised of 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock, or $21.6 million worth based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011 and $0.1 million worth of replacement share-based payment awards attributable to services rendered prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S5	Of this amount, 0.7 million shares were issued based on Alteris completion of a financing arrangement for commercial installation jobs, which we estimated, as of the acquisition date, would be completed.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S6	The consideration excludes $2.4 million of expenses that are reported as acquisition-related costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S7	In addition, the transaction had remaining contingent equity consideration of 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was contingent upon Alteris achievement of certain pre-tax income and cash flow performance targets for 2011, which was not earned.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S8	The fair value of the consideration shares was based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S9	We acquired Alteris, with its premier commercial customer experience, array of financing solutions, and strong in-house engineering expertise, to create a leading renewable energy engineering, procurement and construction provider with a strong presence on both coasts.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S10	We plan to capitalize on Alteris east coast presence and realize synergies from this acquisition by leveraging our existing infrastructure as well as by taking advantage of Alteris expertise with commercial installations.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S11	These strategic benefits expected to be received largely contributed to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S12	With regards to our acquisition of Alteris, we recorded $0.6 million for customer-related intangibles (20 month weighted-average useful life).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P39_S13	Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of Alteris net assets acquired at the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	We included the results of operations from Alteris in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Consequently, $40.9 million of revenue and $0.7 million of net income attributable to Alteris are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The following is supplemental unaudited interim pro forma information for the Alteris acquisition as if we had issued 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock to acquire this business on January 1, 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	The pro forma net revenue and cost of goods sold were decreased by $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 to reflect Alteris adoption of our method, cost to cost, of measuring progress towards completion for jobs accounted for under the percentage of completion method.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Additionally, the pro forma net loss was adjusted to exclude $2.4 million of nonrecurring expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011, related to our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	Finally, pro forma net loss was adjusted by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to include amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense related to replacement stock options, both resulting from the acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S4	All pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable in order to reflect, on a supplemental pro forma basis, the impact of this acquisition on our historical financial information.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S5	We include results from operations of acquired companies in our consolidated financial statements from their respective effective acquisition dates.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S6	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s accounting standards, we evaluated the realizability of our tangible assets and determined based on market place property comparables (level two of the fair value hierarchy) that $2.1 million of our buildings was impaired at September 30, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P41_S7	Additionally, we performed impairment analyses of goodwill and other intangibles using the discounted cash flows method and determined that $19.7 million of goodwill and $0.2 million of other intangibles were impaired at September 30, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	market price for our Class A common stock (level one input of the fair value hierarchy), as adjusted by our judgmental qualitative factors (level three of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	These noncash impairments were necessitated by the trading price of our Class A common stock, recent operating losses, and financial forecasts.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	The $22.0 million of noncash impairment charges are reported in goodwill and other asset impairments on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	(a) During 2012, we impaired $2.1 million of our buildings.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Revolving Line of Credit Under a loan agreement, as amended, with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB Loan ), we have a revolving line of credit that provides for advances not to exceed $6.5 million based upon a borrowing base of 75% of eligible accounts receivable.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	All borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets other than our interests in Alteris Project Financing Company LLC, and bear interest at the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00% plus 4.75%.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	The interest rate accruing on borrowings during a Streamline Period (as defined in the SVB Loan) is the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00% plus 2.00%.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P45_S3	The original maturity date for the SVB Loan was October 30, 2012 and the maturity date was first extended to March 31, 2013 on October 30, 2012 and then again to September 30, 2013 on March 27, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The line of credit has a facility fee of 0.5% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit during the applicable calendar quarter.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	We may reserve up to $500,000 for stand-by letters of credit under the line of credit.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The SVB Loan establishing the line of credit contains various covenants, including a covenant requiring compliance with a liquidity ratio.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	The SVB Loan requires the borrowers to pay a final payment fee of $60 thousand in cash upon termination or maturity of the revolving line of credit.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	The final payment fee will be reduced to $40 thousand if we raise at least $3.0 million in net proceeds through a public offering of our Class A common stock prior to August 31, 2013.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	At December 31, 2012, we had $6.5 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S4	Payable to Gaiam We are engaged in several related party transactions with Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S5	Gaiam is the owner of approximately 37% of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S6	Our Chairman, Jirka Rysavy, also serves as the Chairman of Gaiam and is a significant shareholder of Gaiam.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S7	We have and will continue to have a need for certain services to be provided by Gaiam under our Intercorporate Services Agreement and Industrial Building Lease Agreement for our corporate headquarters.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S8	These services may include, but are not limited to, administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and certain occupancy and related office services as required from time to time.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S9	We have determined that it is not cost effective to obtain and separately maintain the personnel and infrastructure associated with these services with a complement of full time, skilled employees.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S10	Services performed under the Intercorporate Services Agreement have and will be provided under our direction, and Gaiam has no power to act independently on our behalf other than as specifically authorized under the agreement or from time to time by us.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S11	Gaiam and we have and will agree on the aggregate annual amount for a particular year for the services based upon a good faith estimate of the services required for that year and the estimated fees for such services.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S12	Upon a change to the annual amounts for a particular year, the parties have and will make appropriate payments to reflect such change.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P47_S13	The annual amount and formula for various services making up the annual amount, as well as any quarterly changes, have and must be approved in writing by each of Gaiam s and our board of directors.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	During 2011, we completed a project for our Chairman to design and install an upgrade to an existing solar power system originally built in 1997 for his residence.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The contract price or revenue recognized was $244,000, which was priced at a customary rate for work performed for employees.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	In consideration for Gaiam providing additional services under our Intercorporate Services Agreement with Gaiam and agreeing to amend our existing Intercorporate Services Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement with Gaiam, we expensed during 2011 additional fees payable to Gaiam of $672,000.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	Related Party Debt Our related party debt at December 31, 2012 consisted of $4.15 million from Riverside Renewable Energy Investments, LLC ( Riverside ) and $2.7 million from Gaiam, Inc. ( Gaiam ).
1425565_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	At December 31, 2011, our related party debt was comprised of $1.7 million from Gaiam.

1425565_13_ITEM8_P50_S5	These loans bear interest at an annual rate of 10%.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P50_S6	If we repay the $3.0 million and $150 thousand loans owed to Riverside on or before their respective maturity date, the accrued interest is waived.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	As conditions for Gaiam extending the maturity date of its existing $1.7 million loan to us from December 30, 2012 to April 30, 2013 and loaning us an additional $1.0 million, we had to pay all interest owed on the existing Gaiam loan of $1.7 million, execute and deliver to Gaiam in the near future an option agreement, reasonably acceptable to both parties, permitting Gaiam to purchase for $0.2 million all tenant improvements constructed by us in our principal office space leased by us from Gaiam; and amend our facility lease with Gaiam to cancel, effective December 31, 2012, the $3 per square foot credit set forth in the current lease.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Each of the $1.0 million promissory notes entered into with Gaiam and Riverside during December 2012 also include certain customary language making the loans payable upon the occurrence of certain events, such as insolvency or bankruptcy.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Also, if we complete a sale of at least $50,000 of capital stock, then each creditor has the option of converting all or any portion of the principal and interest owing on the loan in question into securities in such sale at the same purchase price as paid by other purchasers in such sale.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	If we fail to make payment of the principal and all interest owing on one or both of these loans within 10 days of when due, then the creditor has the option to acquire an undivided 50% interest in our real property located in Hopland, California (including all land and buildings) in exchange for cancellation of such principal and interest.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	This option is conditioned upon (1) the approval of the transaction by our disinterested directors, and (2) the consent of our senior creditor, Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	The loans are unsecured and subordinated to our indebtedness owed to unaffiliated creditors.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S5	Subject to the rights of senior debt, we have the right to prepay the loans at any time without premium or penalty.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P52_S6	On March 27, 2013, the maturity dates for these loans were extended and Gaiam s $1.7 million loan is now due April 30, 2014, Riverside s $3.0 million loan is due May 4, 2014, Riverside s $150 thousand loan is due June 20, 2014 and each of the $1.0 million loans are due April 26, 2014.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Accrued interest on our related party debt was $0.2 million at December 31, 2012 and is reported in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Gaiam owns approximately 37% of our currently outstanding Class A common stock and is one of our creditors.

1425565_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Debt Our debt, other than related party debt, all of which relates to Alteris, consisted of the following at December 31:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Maturities of debt for each of the periods ended December 31st are as follows:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	We have vehicles financed under capital leases.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The cost of the capitalized leased assets included in property and equipment was $2.0 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	Accumulated amortization of capitalized leased assets was $1.4 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	Amortization expense for capitalized leased assets was $0.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P57_S4	Our future minimum lease payments and capital lease obligations at December 31, 2012 are as follows:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases We lease office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from three to five years.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Until July 2011, when we relocated this portion of our operations, we leased a facility from DTTC Properties, LLC, a limited liability company partially owned by our former chief executive officer, who also was a beneficial owner of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	This lease agreement required monthly base payments of $10,694 plus common area operating expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	Under this lease, we incurred expense of approximately $75,000 and $161,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P59_S3	On December 19, 2011, we entered into a five year facility lease with Gaiam for office space located in one of Gaiam s owned buildings in Colorado that commenced on January 1, 2012 and provides for monthly payment of approximately $11,179 plus common area maintenance expenses.

1425565_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Risks and Uncertainties We are subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of our business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and seasonal nature of our business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	We have accrued for probable and estimatable costs that may be incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available to us.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual costs could vary from those accruals.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Shareholders Equity and Warrants During 2012, we issued 33,056 shares of our Class A common stock under our Real Goods Solar, Inc. 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2008 Incentive Plan ) to certain of our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	On December 19, 2011, we issued 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock as consideration for Alteris.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted its remaining 2,153,293 shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	At the end of 2011, Gaiam owned approximately 37% of our outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	During 2011, we issued 29,408 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2008 Incentive Plan to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	On June 30, 2011, we repurchased 379,400 shares of our Class A common stock for a total cost of $1.1 million.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S4	We recorded this repurchase of our shares in accordance with the cost method of accounting for treasury stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P62_S5	Since we have not yet decided the ultimate disposition of the re-acquired shares, their cost is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 as a $1.1 million reduction to additional paid-in capital.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	During 2010, we issued 21,040 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2008 Incentive Plan to our independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Following this issuance, Gaiam owned 54.6% of our total outstanding common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	For the last five years, we have valued shares issued to our independent directors at estimated fair value based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date the shares were issued, which by policy is the last trading day of each quarter in which the services were rendered.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S3	As part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Carlson Solar on January 1, 2008, we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S4	On November 1, 2007, as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Marin Solar, we issued seven-year warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S5	At December 31, 2012, we had the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance: Each holder of our Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S6	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted all of its holdings of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock and, as a result, we have had no shares of Class B common stock outstanding since December 31, 2011.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P63_S7	Under the terms of our articles of incorporation and merger with Alteris, we are prohibited from issuing Class B common stock in the future.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	All holders of Class A common stock vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Accordingly, Gaiam and Riverside, as the holders of approximately 37% and 29% of the Class A common stock, respectively, and entitled to vote in any election of directors, may exert significant influence over the election of the directors.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Real Goods Solar, our Class A common stock holders are entitled to share ratably in our assets remaining after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	Holders of our Class A common stock have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Our share-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors and to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	We primarily grant options under our 2008 Incentive Plan, but have also granted 300,000 non-shareholder approved options to our chief executive officer during 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	Our 2008 Incentive Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to the lesser of 3,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock or 10% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P67_S3	Furthermore, our Board of Directors has resolved that all types of granted options shall not exceed 10% of our then outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Incentive Plan.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, business partners, and certain key advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the Incentive Plan.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Options vest based on services conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in our industry and our stock price volatility since our initial public offering.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	We primarily use historical data by participant groupings to estimate option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	The following are the variables we used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under our incentive plans for each of the years presented: The table below presents a summary of our option activity as of December 31, 2012 and changes during the year then ended: As specified under the terms of our acquisition of Alteris (see Note 3.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Mergers and Acquisitions), upon consummation of the acquisition in 2011, options for Alteris membership units were replaced with equal in fair value options to purchase our stock.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	In this regard, 478,500 replacement options were granted by us at an exercise price of $2.96 per share.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S3	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $0.76, $1.67 and $2.04, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S4	The total fair value of shares vested was $0.4 million during each of 2012 and 2011 and $0.1 million during 2010.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S5	Our share-based compensation cost charged against income was $0.4 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million during the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is shown in general and administrative expenses.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S6	The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was nil, $0.2 million, and $0.1 million for the years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S7	As of December 31, 2012, there was $0.7 million of unrecognized cost related to nonvested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P74_S8	We expect that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Income Taxes Our provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had $10.5 million in tax effected federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, begin to expire in 2018.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	Additionally, we had $2.7 million in tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	These operating loss carryforwards, if unused, will begin to expire in 2019.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that limit the net operating loss available for use in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership interest.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	A change in ownership of a company of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership changes.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Certain of our net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2012 are subject to annual limitations due to changes in ownership.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	During 2012, we performed assessments on the realizability of our net deferred tax assets considering all available evidence, both positive and negative.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	As a result of these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that none of our net deferred tax assets would be recoverable through the reversal of temporary differences and normal business activities in the near term and, therefore, we established a valuation allowance through a noncash charge of $16.1 million to our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	Additionally, to the extent we become entitled to utilize certain loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to our initial public offering, we are required under the terms of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, May 13, 2008.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P80_S4	These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2018 if not utilized.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2012, $4.4 million of these net operating loss carryforwards remained available for current and future utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $1.6 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1425565_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	(a) The quarter ended September 30, 2012 includes a noncash charge of $22.0 million for the impairment of goodwill and other assets and a noncash charge of $14.5 million for the establishment of a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets.
1425565_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	(b) The quarter ended December 31, 2012 includes a noncash charge of $1.6 million for an additional valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets generated during that quarter.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2012, they have concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on that assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_13_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Form 10-K.

1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We also perform most of our own sales and marketing activities to generate leads and secure projects.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	We offer turnkey services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our solar energy systems use high-quality solar system components from tier-1 manufacturers such as Canadian Solar and Fronius for PV modules and inverters respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	We use proven technologies and techniques to help customers achieve meaningful savings by reducing their utility costs and total cost of energy.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S5	In addition, we help customers lower their emissions of carbon and reliance upon fossil fuel energy sources.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P0_S6	As part of our evolution and to participate in the broader solar value chain, we recently expanded the loan and lease finance options provided to our customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	We, including our predecessors, have over 35 years of experience in providing solar energy directly to end users.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We have designed and installed over 19,000 residential and commercial solar systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	This makes us one of the most experienced and one of the largest downstream solar companies in the country.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Presently we serve customers in the United States from offices located in ten states.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	In our history we have completed solar installations for customers in more than 30 states.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S5	Our goal is to continue to build upon our national presence to become one of the largest and most profitable residential and commercial solar energy integrators in the United States.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P1_S6	Our strategies to achieve this goal are:
1425565_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Continue to expand into markets with favorable legislation and incentives for solar energy.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	As jurisdictions adopt new, or improve existing, incentive programs that enhance the economics of solar energy systems, we intend to focus our sales and marketing efforts in those states and territories to increase our customer base.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	In addition to federal investment tax credits, many jurisdictions, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation and incentives favorable to distributed solar energy production.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Continue to drive growth through organic and acquisition efforts.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The U.S. solar energy installation market is highly fragmented.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our acquisition strategy is intended to consolidate markets and achieve economies of scale, increasing operating efficiencies and our competitive strengths.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our organic growth strategy targets markets with favorable solar energy regulatory environments and is intended to leverage our historic presence in those markets.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Continue to disrupt the centralized energy production model.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The centralized production of energy reduces consumer choice and leads to increased costs during periods of peak demand.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our objective of increasing distributed electrical energy production reduces reliance on utility energy providers and results in lower energy costs for the consumer.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that we have a number of advantages over our competitors.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our competitors include other solar providers as well as electric utilities already serving our potential customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Low barriers to switching to solar.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our approach includes design, engineering, financing referral, procurement, permitting and construction of the solar energy system.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Customers are able to transition to sustainable solar energy efficiently.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have a highly experienced management team.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our management team, including the members of our Board of Directors, has significant experience building national and international organizations.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our national footprint, with West Coast, East Coast and Midwest operations, allows us to offer solar energy systems at lower costs than our competitors through economies of scale.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Description of our Services We offer turnkey solar energy services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	We install residential and commercial systems that are generally between 3 kilowatts, or kW, and 1megawatt, or MW, output, with the average residential installation being approximately 6 kW output.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also on occasion install larger commercial projects in the 3-4 MW range.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	We also have the capability and have successfully completed larger projects for utility customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S5	We design and build our solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S6	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average daily consumption rates in different seasons of the year to size the solar energy system and engineer its wiring.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S7	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar PV modules.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S8	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory and its rate structures and the customer s budget and preferred financing method, as well as the customer s aesthetic preferences.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S9	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates and various other factors.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P11_S10	We assess this data using solar monitoring tools and analytical calculations, which enable us to design a solar energy system to a size and configuration that maximizes energy efficiency for each customer s circumstances.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit which is necessary for rebate processing.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis and determine the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	As soon as the building permit is approved, our installation professionals begin the installation by placing metal racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the solar PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We do not custom manufacture solar PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	After the solar PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction and at the same time apply for the local utility company to interconnect the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	A basic solar energy system has no moving parts and consists of a number of solar PV modules wired together and mounted on a metal framing structure located either on our customer s roof or on a freestanding mounting structure, an inverter and the balance of systems and safety equipment necessary to connect the system to the customer s existing utility service.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We source solar PV modules from several primary manufacturers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	These modules range in conversion efficiency from 14% to 19%.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Solar PV modules can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono- and poly-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide, or CIGS, and cadmium telluride.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Developments in solar PV technology have generated advances in the conversion efficiency of solar PV cells, reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in manufacturing yields.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	An inverter is an electronic device that converts the low-voltage DC power generated by solar PV modules to conventional 120-volt AC power used by standard household lights and appliances.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	While an inverter may need to be replaced approximately 15 years after installation, other system components typically do not require replacement during the 20- to 25-year warranty period applicable to solar PV modules.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Individual solar energy systems are connected to the utility grid by an inverter, which also allows the excess electricity produced to flow into the grid, causing the customer s electric meter effectively to run backwards, to the credit of the customer s utility account, sometimes at standard retail prices.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	A customer that has a grid-connected solar energy system draws energy from the grid through the conventional local utility when the sun is not shining, or when household energy consumption exceeds the solar energy system s energy generation capacity.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Warranty Terms Most manufacturers of solar PV modules currently offer a 20- to 25-year transferable warranty of their products.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	We offer a 10-year parts and labor warranty, which covers property damage arising from the installation.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We generally handle manufacturer warranty claims for solar PV modules as part of our customer service and we are typically reimbursed by the manufacturers for our labor and materials.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	Historically, our costs associated with warranty claims have been minimal.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	Financing While many of our customers choose to purchase their solar energy systems without the use of financing, we also connect our customers with preferred third-party financing sources.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S5	We presently offer a diverse array of financing options to our customers especially in the residential sector where in addition to third-party leasing solutions, we also offer a variety of loan options.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S6	Our diverse finance offerings allow us to provide solar power to our customers at prices that are economically attractive to their individual situation.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S7	In addition, maintaining a variety of financing sources allows us to source customer financing under the most favorable terms.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S8	We work with solar financing partners who provide long-term leases of solar systems to our customers for up to a 20-year period.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S9	The long term of the lease helps lower the monthly cost and such leases may also provide our customer with a no money down option.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P20_S10	Many customers find this option to be attractive in that the new combined monthly payments to their electric utility plus the solar lease payment can be less than the amount previously being paid monthly to their utility provider.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We handle some of the administrative processing for our customers that choose to use third-party financing or leasing.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The substantial knowledge we have gained in working with financing sources to market and facilitate sales to our customers has allowed us to increase our in-house financing capabilities and explore meaningful options to directly participate in the financing part of the solar value chain.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	For instance, we recently expanded our finance offerings to commercial customers to include an in-house co-managed fund.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 we expanded our residential financing capabilities including the hiring of key personnel.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	We believe that investments in these key areas will allow us to increase the value we provide to our customers, increase velocity in the sales cycle and allow us to participate in the long-term ownership potential of solar assets which we believe will also be beneficial to our shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our outside sales force works in the markets we serve and follows up on sales leads we receive.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The outside sales team visits potential customers in their homes, explaining the advantages of solar energy and answering customer questions.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our door-to-door sales efforts include engaging potential customers through door hangers and conversations, resulting in sales leads for our outside sales team.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our e-sales and inside sales groups provide the opportunity to initially engage with potential customers without a site visit.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The e-sales and inside sales groups discuss the customer s interest in solar energy and compile data necessary to assess potential cost savings and costs to install the system.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	We utilize electronic contracts and digital signatures within these teams.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our customer referral program is designed to be an effective and efficient method reaching new customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our program provides cash incentives to current customers to refer friends, relatives and co-workers to us.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to sustainable energy.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations of less than 10kW in size.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	Our commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service and municipal services.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S5	Our commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally between 250 kW and 1 MW in size.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S6	Suppliers Our solar energy systems utilize solar panels and inverters purchased from several manufacturers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S7	We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S8	We purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S9	Competition We primarily compete with other solar companies providing similar services.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P25_S10	These companies vary in size and capability and our larger competitors include Solar City and Verengo in the residential space and companies such as Borrego, REC Solar, and groSolar in the commercial space.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The solar industry as a whole has rapidly evolved in recent years.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The competitive landscape changed substantially over the past year and is expected to continue to rapidly change.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	For instance, electric utilities are our competition, both as incumbent power providers and also as recent entrants into the downstream solar market.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Additional recent new competitors also include traditional third party solar finance companies such as SunRun.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Historically they did not compete directly with us in the downstream solar market but recent acquisitions and establishment of new channel relationships which will likely make them competitors in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P26_S5	We believe we understand these rapidly changing dynamics and are well positioned to adapt our sales and marketing, customer finance and delivery methods and our business model to maintain and grow our position in the market.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Regulations We work with local electrical utilities to obtain permission to operate and interconnection for our customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Interconnection is, generally, a standard agreement between the customer and the utility.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	There are no additional regulatory approvals required following interconnection approval.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	We employ a team of administrators who work with utilities to achieve interconnection approval for our customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	We are subject to several federal, state and local laws and regulations governing safety on our job sites.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	We employ a safety professional to ensure we remain in compliance with such laws and regulation.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S6	Many of our municipal and government projects are subject to prevailing wage requirements.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S7	We have registered and operate under the tradenames Real Goods , Real Goods Solar and RGS Energy .
1425565_14_ITEM1_P27_S8	Registrations are valid for ten years and we maintain registrations by filing all required renewal application and fees when due.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather in certain geographic regions, especially in the northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Employees As of March 21, 2014, we had approximately 488 full-time and 11 part-time employees.
1425565_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	U.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The federal government currently offers a 30% investment tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Federal ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2016.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This credit is due to adjust to 10% in 2017.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers to obtain applicable incentive payments and reimbursement and the failure to successfully do so may decrease our revenue and profitability.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We, in some instances, prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers to obtain applicable incentive payments and reimbursements.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may price our products assuming that we will be successful in obtaining available incentive payments and reimbursements.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely manner and successfully obtain all incentive payments and reimbursements available to us or to our customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and sales margin will be negatively impacted.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Adverse general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Adverse overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, spending on housing, business conditions, stock market volatility, weather conditions, acts of terrorism, threats of war, and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	While many economic indicators have improved recently, activity in many areas of the general U.S. economy remain sluggish.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If the economic conditions continue to be adverse or worsen, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such impacts may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Increases in funding costs and limitations on our access to liquidity could have a negative impact on our earnings and our ability to drive our growth strategies.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In addition, in the past, the deteriorating general economic conditions in the United States have caused a drop in consumer spending in general, and discretionary spending in particular.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If these were to occur again in the future, these dynamics may also adversely impact the solar sector.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to grow our business at the rate we desire.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	A drop in the retail price of conventional energy or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional energy, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Existing regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that could deter purchases of solar energy systems and investment in the research and development of solar energy technology.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Without a mandated regulatory exception for solar energy systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Such fees could increase the cost to our customers of using solar energy systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, operating results and financial condition.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rates rather than with the less expensive average price of electricity.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate, would require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date about these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis and payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, and any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For some of our projects, we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis and, as a result, our revenue from these installations is driven by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Although we generally build payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments could adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We experience spikes in orders in the Spring and Summer months, which due to lead time result in installations and revenue increasing during the Summer and Fall.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentive available and the tax appetite of the customer.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to construct systems outdoors can be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and cash flow.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant market share.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from our solar energy integration services from sales in west coast and northeast states.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from solar energy integration services from projects in fewer than ten states located on the West Coast and in the Northeast and Midwest.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our success may depend in part on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	As part of our business strategy, we may expand our operations through strategic acquisitions in our current markets and in new geographic markets.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We have acquired several businesses over the last few years.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	If we are unable to complete successful acquisitions in the future, it could impede our growth prospects in a consolidating industry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Our acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These risks, as well as other circumstances that often accompany expansion through acquisitions, could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the size, timing and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Consequently, our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our failure to integrate the operations of acquired businesses successfully into our operations or to manage our anticipated growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We must integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that leverage our revenue and growth opportunities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The integration of the management, operations, and facilities of acquired businesses with our own could involve difficulties, which could adversely affect our growth rate and operating results.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We may be unable to complete effectively the integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; to manage efficiently the combined operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; to achieve our operating, growth and performance goals for acquired businesses; to achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or to achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Our rate of growth and operating performance may suffer if we fail to manage acquired businesses profitably without substantial additional costs or operational problems or to implement effectively combined growth and operating strategies.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Our internal control environment will need to evolve to keep up with the activities of a dynamic business poised for growth.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Our failure to implement effective systems of internal controls, or modify those systems, as we acquire and integrate new businesses, could have an impact on the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting and on our ability to prevent fraud.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S12	If we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal controls with respect to acquired businesses, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial results or prevent fraud from occurring.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Additionally, we may incur significant expense and be required to expend significant effort in implementing a system of internal controls in our newly acquired businesses, the extent of which can be difficult to predict.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S14	While we are implementing such systems, there is a risk that errors and misstatements could occur, resulting in a negative impact on the reliability of our financial statements and potentially other adverse developments such as regulatory action or litigation.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S15	We have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S16	If our revenue levels decrease or if we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S17	We have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $89.5 million as of December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S18	If our revenue levels decrease or do not grow at a rate greater than the costs incurred in our growth, and ultimately result in net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S19	We may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs and the size, timing and structure of future acquisitions.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S20	Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S21	Any borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on future borrowings.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S22	If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P21_S23	In addition, our operations may not generate sufficient cash for our acquisition plans.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept our equity as full or partial payment.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Using our equity for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	To the extent that we are unable to use our equity to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose through debt or equity financings.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Competitors with superior access to capital may have a significant advantage over us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain adequate financing for expansion and acquisitions timely.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The solar installation industry is highly fragmented and continues to move toward consolidation.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater capital resources than we have.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we do not have available capital, for example, as a result of our inability to produce cash flow or obtain financing on acceptable terms, when acquisition opportunities arise, may preclude us from competing for available acquisition opportunities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	As of March 21, 2014, we had indebtedness of approximately $6.6 million.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	capital lease obligations and miscellaneous debt financing of approximately $450,000 with various maturity dates.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet our long-term debt service obligations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As illustrated above, during 2014, the majority of our indebtedness will become due and payable.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or new sources of credit in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements and our debt service requirements may increase significantly.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain capital to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our failure to meet our debt service obligations or pay our indebtedness when it comes due may cause us to become insolvent, which would cast doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	make payments on or amend any subordinated obligations Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S7	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S8	The expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S9	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S10	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S11	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S12	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S13	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S14	Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S15	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S16	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P30_S17	We depend upon a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our solar energy systems and our inability to purchase components would adversely affect our results of operations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We rely on third-party suppliers for components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The failure of our suppliers to supply us with components in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules and harm our operating results and business expansion efforts.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our orders with certain of our suppliers may represent a very small portion of their total business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As a result, these suppliers may not give priority to our business, leading to potential delays in or cancellation of our orders.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If any of our suppliers were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted companies such as us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Shortages of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules we use in our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Shortages of silicon cause the prices for solar photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	A substantial portion of the PV modules we utilize are not sourced from domestic suppliers.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A change in the rules presently governing international trade could have an adverse effect on either the supply of PV modules or their cost .
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Most PV module suppliers are Chinese companies and vast majority of the PV modules used in the United States are imported from China or by Chinese companies.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	This has caused some friction with the remaining domestic or European companies and is currently being investigated by the US government as to whether Chinese are unfairly competing in the United States.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P36_S4	These trade investigations may result in tariffs negatively impacting product pricing and/or availability of PV modules.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors could prevent us from completing installations as planned, including the escalation of construction costs beyond increments anticipated in our installation budgets.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Solar installations have certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical and mechanical malfunction.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, our projects entail additional risks related to structural heights.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our installation projects also entail significant risks, including:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	increases in the cost of solar panels, inverters and other products used in our installations, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our construction and installation projects.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of market share or reduced margins.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and fragmented with low barriers to entry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We currently compete with a large number of relatively small installers and integrators, some of which do not have extensive industry experience and may lack adequate systems and capital, but some of which benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As the solar energy industry expands and industry consolidation occurs, we will also more and more encounter competition from larger companies, some of which may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	An increase in pricing structures of our third party financing partners could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Many of our customers depend on third party lease financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase our solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Third-party financing sources for solar energy systems are currently limited, and due to the limited sources, they have significant leverage and control over the terms and pricing for their financing products.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S6	If our financing partners increase their pricing structure, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S7	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S8	An increase in the pricing structures of our third party financing partners likely will have a negative effect on our results of operations.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S9	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S10	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S11	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S12	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S13	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S14	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S15	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S16	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S17	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S18	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S19	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a 10-year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P42_S20	In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims and we have not had material warranty claims in the past, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial condition.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase a solar energy system.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We must meet the NASDAQ Capital Market ( NASDAQ ) continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	During 2012, we received four different notices from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with certain NASDAQ rules.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As of February 21, 2013, we had regained compliance with all applicable NASDAQ rules.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	There can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the continued listing requirements for the NASDAQ Capital Market, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P45_S5	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The SEC rules and the NASDAQ Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S7	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P46_S8	The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S5	As of December 31, 2013, there were 36.4 million shares of our Class A common stock outstanding.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S6	As of that date, we also had an aggregate of 8.3 million shares of our Class A common stock that may be issued upon exercise or conversion of outstanding related party convertible debt, options, and warrants.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P47_S7	On June 3, 2013 we closed a private placement and issued approximately 3.4 million shares of our Class A common stock, together with warrants to purchase 1.7 million shares of our Class A common stock, as adjusted in connection with the subsequent issuance of securities pursuant to the terms of the warrants.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	On August 9, 2013 we acquired Syndicated Solar, Inc. in an asset purchase that met the requirements of Reg.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	D under the Securities Act, partial consideration for which includes future issuance of up to approximately 1.7 million shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	On November 20, 2013 we closed a public offering and issued approximately 5.9 million shares of our Class A common stock, together with warrants to purchase approximately 5.0 million shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	On January 15, 2014, we acquired Mercury Energy in a merger transaction and issued approximately 8.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, subject to adjustment for changes in working capital, to effect the merger.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	As further discussed under Item 9B of this Form 10-K, on March 26, 2014 we entered into an agreement to acquire a solar company in Hawaii for cash and up to $10.0 million of our Class A common stock (which includes shares of our Class A commons stock potentially issuable under an earn out).
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We also have two effective shelf registration statements, one covering approximately $5.0 million aggregate offering price of securities, and another covering $200 million aggregate offering price of securities (in each case, all of which could be issued as shares of Class A common stock).
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Additionally, we may grant awards covering up to approximately 705,000 additional shares of Class A common stock under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S7	In addition, derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P48_S8	For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that, among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants which is adjustable (currently $2.50 per share), after taking into account the Black Scholes and fair market values of the warrants and such anti-dilution protection rights, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may sell securities in the future in order to finance operations, expansions, or particular projects or expenditures.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Such issuances would have a significant dilutive effect.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of stock options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our Class A common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market ( NASDAQ ) under the trading symbol RGSE.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance of any liquidity or resale value of our Class A common stock, and shareholders may be required to hold shares of our Class A common stock for an indefinite period of time.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Securities analysts may not continue to cover our Class A common stock, and this may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock s market price.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	If our stock is downgraded by a securities analyst, our stock price would likely decline.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If the analyst ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Accordingly, shareholders would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Risk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam and Riverside Riverside has influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Riverside holds approximately 22% of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Riverside s ownership may increase, stay the same or decrease depending on the amount of shares of Class A common stock we issue in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Riverside currently has the right to designate two individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Because of Riverside s voting rights and its ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, Riverside will be able to exert influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares authorized for issuance under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S6	Accordingly, shares of our Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Riverside did not maintain voting significance over us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S7	Riverside is not prohibited from selling a significant interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S8	Our historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S9	Our historical financial information for periods when Gaiam controlled us does not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S10	The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S11	These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S12	The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, or what they will be in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P60_S13	We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Possible future sales of shares by Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Riverside may sell any or all of the shares of Class A common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement between Riverside and us, entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Riverside has the right to require us to register the shares of Class A common stock that it owns to facilitate the possible sale of such shares.
1425565_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.
1425565_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	property is also the location of a 12-acre Solar Living Center.
1425565_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities: Our existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 3 months to 4 years.

Overview We are a leading provider of turnkey commercial and residential solar energy solutions, with more than 19,000 solar systems in place.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We also have more than 35 years of experience in solar energy, beginning with the sale in 1978 of the first solar PV panels in the United States.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	With 16 offices across the West, Midwest and the Northeast, we are one of the larger solar energy installers in the U.S. in the residential and commercial sectors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	However, there are market participants, especially in the utility-size solar systems, who are much larger than us.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our revenue primarily results from the installation of solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S6	We also derive a portion of our revenue from the retail sale of renewable energy products.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S7	Our expenses primarily consist of labor costs, costs of solar modules, invertors, balance of systems and other direct costs associated with solar system installation, and related sales and marketing and general and administrative costs.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S8	We continue to expect strong demand for both residential and commercial solar installations, despite the overall economic weakness in the United States.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P1_S9	As one of the few solar installers with a relatively strong national footprint, we expect to capitalize on our market position and the expanding U.S. solar industry.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables We obtained financial control, through an Agreement and Plan of Merger, of 100% of the voting equity interests of Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC d/b/a Alteris Renewables ( Alteris ) on June 21, 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	The total consideration transferred was approximately $21.7 million and was comprised of 8.7 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $21.6 million based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.48 per share on June 21, 2011, and $0.1 million worth of replacement share-based payment awards attributable to services rendered prior to the acquisition date.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We purchased certain assets and assumed certain current liabilities of Syndicated Solar, Inc. ( Syndicated ) through an Asset Purchase Agreement on August 9, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The total consideration transferred was approximately $2.4 million and was comprised of 400,000 shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $916,000 based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $2.29 per share on August 9, 2013, approximately, $1.2 million of liabilities assumed in excess of assets acquired and cash of $250,000.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition the fair value of liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of assets acquired by $1.2 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of Mercury Energy, Inc. on January 14, 2014 through a merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger.

1425565_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	For further details about the acquisition, see Item 9B in this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue consists primarily of solar energy system installation fees.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed contract or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	We recognize revenue for fixed price contracts from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete, while we recognize revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The percentage-of-completion method involves estimates of progress.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe the best indicator of progress toward completion of the project is costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated actual costs.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness, and current economic trends.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located in various warehouse facilities and finished goods held for sale at our Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We state our inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Since we operate in only one business segment, we assess impairment at the Company level.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	We have the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying amount.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	If it is determined that the fair value of the Company is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	If it is determined that the two-step impairment test is necessary, then for step one, we compare the estimated fair value of the Company with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, we consider the Company s goodwill not impaired.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	We use either a comparable market approach, traditional present value method, or some combination thereof to test for potential impairment.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, we make assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, independent expert appraisals.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Share-Based Compensation We recognize compensation cost for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	In calculating this fair value, there are certain highly subjective assumptions that we use, consisting of estimated market value of our stock, the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and volatility.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income Taxes We provide for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P17_S5	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net revenue .
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Net revenue increased $8.5 million, or 9.1%, to $101.3 million during 2013 from $92.9 million during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The increase in revenue reflects an increase in solar systems constructed to a record 29.7 megawatts in 2013 from 26.6 megawatts in 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Gross profit decreased $722,000, or 3.1%, to $22.3 million during 2013 from $23.0 million during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 22.0% during 2013 from 24.8% during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	The decline in gross profit reflects competitive pricing pressure as well as the adverse impact of inclement weather on labor utilization efficiency in the four quarters of 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S6	Selling and operating expenses decreased $4.1 million, or 13.9%, to $25.7 million during 2013 from $29.8 million during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S7	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses decreased to 25.3% during 2013 from 32.1% during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S8	The decrease in selling and operating expenses is attributable to consolidation of functions in our Colorado office and resulting reductions in headcount.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S9	General and administrative expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 21.9%, to $7.0 million during 2013 from $8.9 million during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S10	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.9% during 2013 from 9.6% during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S11	The decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to consolidation of back-office functions in our Colorado office and resulting decreases in headcount.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S12	Acquisition and other costs were $2.0 million during 2013 and were the result of our acquisition of Syndicated, the acquisition of Mercury, which closed on January 14, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S13	Net interest income was $1.1 million for 2013 The 2013 amount was impacted by a non-cash benefit of approximately $2.0 million recorded as interest income arising from the application of fair value accounting to the common stock warrant liability of approximately $15.1 million at December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S14	Excluding the benefit, interest expense was approximately $0.9 million for 2013 compared to approximately $0.8 million for 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S15	The increase reflects interest charges related to the revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S16	Income tax expense was $58,000 for 2013, representing state income taxes not offset by the loss from operations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P19_S17	As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $11.3 million, or $0.38 per share, during 2013 compared to $47.2 million, or $1.77 per share, during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Net revenue .
1425565_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Net revenue decreased $16.4 million, or 15.0%, to $92.9 million during 2012 from $109.3 million during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the direct supplying to customers by financing companies of certain components used in residential installation.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Sourcing of such components in conjunction with the associated financing allowed residential customers to take advantage of certain expiring tax benefits, and are referred to as safe harbor installations and amounted to $9.6 million in 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	While we recognize lower revenue from safe harbor installations, our gross margins are similar to non-safe harbor installations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	In addition, revenue from commercial customer installations declined by approximately $6.0 million due to a lower average sales price per watt installed.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Gross profit decreased $4.8 million, or 17.3%, to $23.0 million during 2012 from $27.9 million during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 24.8% during 2012 from 25.5% during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	The decrease in gross profit was due to a higher proportion of commercial installations, which have lower gross profit margins than residential installations, as well as lower year over year average margins on those commercial installations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	Selling and operating expenses increased $6.2 million, or 26.1%, to $29.8 million during 2012 from $23.6 million during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S6	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses increased to 32.1% during 2012 from 21.6% during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S7	The increase in selling and operating expenses is attributable to costs associated with the integration of Alteris that resulted in the centralization of functions in our Colorado corporate head office.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S8	General and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million, or 116.8%, to $8.9 million during 2012 from $4.1 million during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S9	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 9.6% during 2012 from 3.8% during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S10	The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to investments in our Louisville, Colorado head office, in management and leadership talent, and in shared services personnel subsequent to the Alteris merger, and executive recruiting fees.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S11	Acquisition-related costs were $2.4 million during 2011 and were the result of our acquisition of Alteris.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P21_S12	Goodwill and other asset impairments were $22.0 million for 2012 and were comprised of noncash impairment charges of $19.7 million for goodwill, $2.1 million for property and equipment, and $0.2 million for other intangibles.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	We estimated the fair value of our business for the intangibles impairment analysis based on the quoted market price for our Class A common stock (level one input of the fair value hierarchy), as adjusted by our judgmental qualitative factors (level three of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The impairment of our property and equipment was based on market place property comparables (level two of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	These noncash impairments were necessitated by the trading price of our Class A common stock, recent operating losses, and our financial forecasts.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Income tax expense was $8.7 million for 2012 and includes a $16.1 million noncash charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $47.2 million, or $1.77 per share, during 2012 compared to $1.9 million, or $0.08 per share, during 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital needs arise from capital related to acquisitions of new businesses, working capital required to fund our purchases of solar PV modules and inverters, replacements, expansions and improvements to our infrastructure, and future growth.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	These capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including business acquisitions, the ability to attract new solar energy system installation customers, market acceptance of our product offerings, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product offerings, the level of expenditures for sales and marketing, the level of investment in support systems and facilities and other factors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	The timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and may fluctuate from time to time.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	To the extent we have or can arrange available capital, we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and other opportunities to expand our sales territories, technologies, and products and increase our sales and marketing programs as needed.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2013, and we do not presently have any plans for future material capital expenditures.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	On December 19, 2011, several of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (as amended by the First Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2012, the Second Loan Modification and Reinstatement Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2012, the Third Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of March 27, 2013, the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2013, and the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2013, the Loan Agreement ).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Originally, the Loan Agreement provided for a revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	In the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2013, Silicon Valley Bank also agreed to extend a term loan to the borrowers.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Currently, the following of Real Goods Solar s wholly owned subsidiaries are parties to the Loan Agreement:
1425565_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Real Goods Energy Tech, Inc., Real Goods Trading Corporation, Alteris Renewables, Inc., and Real Goods Syndicated, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	As amended by the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2013, the amount of available credit under the revolving line of credit is $6.5 million, subject to the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 75% of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Loan Agreement).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Fourth Loan Modification Agreement also extended the maturity date from September 30, 2013 to September 29, 2014 and permitted repayment of certain subordinated debt held by Gaiam and Riverside, subject to our meeting certain liquidity thresholds and certain other subordination conditions are met.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Additionally, the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement increased the liquidity ratio with which the borrowers must comply and added a covenant obligating the borrowers to meet certain EBITDA thresholds each quarter.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	The Fourth Loan Modification Agreement also increased the interest rate on borrowings.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	As a result, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving line of credit is the greater of (a) the greater of the bank s prime rate and 4.00%, plus 4.00 and (b) 8.00%.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	The interest rate accruing on borrowings under the revolving line of credit during a Streamline Period (as defined in the Loan Agreement) is the greater of (i) the greater of the bank s prime rate and 4.00%, plus 2.00%, and (ii) 6.00%.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement, Real Goods Syndicated, Inc. joined as a party to the Loan Agreement and granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Also, pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement, the borrowers, Real Goods Solar and Silicon Valley Bank also entered into an Intellectual Property Security Agreement, pursuant to which the borrowers and Real Goods Solar pledged certain copyrights, trademarks, patents and mask works to secure the obligations of the borrowers under the Loan Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The borrowers paid Silicon Valley Bank a $65,000 extension fee and agreed to reimburse the bank for certain expenses incurred in connection with entering into the Fourth Loan Modification Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Loan Agreement requires the borrowers to pay a final payment fee of $40,000 in cash upon termination or maturity of the revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	On November 5, 2013, the parties to the Loan Agreement entered into a Fifth Loan Modification Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Under the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement, Silicon Valley Bank agreed to extend to the borrowers a term loan of up to $2.0 million (the Term Loan ) under the terms of the Loan Agreement in addition to the $6.5 million revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	The Term Loan matures on September 29, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	The borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest only with respect to the Term Loan with the aggregate principal balance of the Term Loan, together with any accrued but unpaid interest, due and payable on the maturity date.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	The borrowers may prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	The proceeds of the Term Loan are required to be used to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness owed to Gaiam under the $1.7 loan and the $1.0 loan described below.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Fifth Loan Modification Agreement requires the borrowers to pay a final payment fee of $150,000 in cash upon termination or maturity of the Term Loan.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	All borrowings under the Term Loan are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all assets of the borrowers other than the limited liability company interests in Alteris Project Financing Company LLC, and bear interest at (a) the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00%, plus (b) 2.00% (or 10.00% during an event of default).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The borrowers are obligated to pay to Silicon Valley Bank a final payment fee of $150,000 on or before the Term Loan maturity date.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement, at any time when (a) the borrowers unrestricted cash at Silicon Valley Bank, less (b) all outstanding obligations of borrowers owed to Silicon Valley Bank, is less than $2,000,000, the borrowers availability under the existing $6,500,000 line of credit will be reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Silicon Valley Bank fully funded the Term Loan on November 5, 2013 at the borrowers request.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	We used the proceeds of the Term Loan together with other available cash on hand to pay in full all indebtedness owed to Gaiam on the same day, as further described below.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	We entered into a consent agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on May 10, 2013, to extend until June 30, 2013 the requirement that we obtain net proceeds of not less than $3.4 million from borrowing under a new subordinated debt agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, until receipt of such proceeds, we agreed to deposit with Silicon Valley Bank $500,000 of unrestricted cash, which it is required to maintain under the terms of the Loan Agreement, in a restricted account at the bank.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Although we explored new financing alternatives, we were unable to comply with the subordinated debt requirement by June 30, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	However, Silicon Valley Bank agreed that the terms of the consent agreement were met before June 30, 2013 based on the private placement closed on June 3, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	As further discussed under Item 9B in this Form 10-K, the borrower entered into a Waiver Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank on March 23, 2014 pursuant to which Silicon Valley Bank agreed to waive a default for the quarterly compliance period ended December 31, 2013 and certain covenant testing for the quarterly compliance period ending March 31, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Upon the closing of the Alteris transaction on December 19, 2011, we received commitments from Riverside to make us a single loan of up to $3.15 million and from Gaiam to loan us up to $1.7 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Gaiam funded its loan commitment on December 30, 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Riverside loaned us $3.0 million on May 4, 2012 and another $150,000 on June 20, 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	The loans originally were for a period of 12 months.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	The maturity dates for these loans have been extended and Riverside s $3.0 million loan is due September 3, 2014, Riverside s $150,000 loan is due October 29, 2014, and, at the time of repayment, Gaiam s $1.7 million loan was due April 30, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	The loans bear interest at a rate of 10%.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	If we repay the loans owed to Riverside on or before their respective maturity date, the accrued interest is waived.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	On April 23, 2013, we entered into a conversion agreement with Gaiam pursuant to which the principal amount of Gaiam s $1.7 million promissory note was reduced by $100,000 in exchange for 62,111 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The conversion ratio was determined based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of the agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	As of November 20, 2013, we owed $3.15 million to Riverside on these loans.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	We have not paid any interest or principal on Riverside s loan.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	On November 5, 2013, we repaid the indebtedness owed to Gaiam under the $1.7 million loan.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	On November 13, 2012, we entered into a Loan Commitment with Gaiam and Riverside pursuant to which each agreed to advance to us up to an additional $1.0 million in cash upon request from us until March 31, 2013 at an annual interest rate of 10% and with an original maturity date of April 26, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	During December 2012, we requested and received an advance of $1.0 million from each of Gaiam and Riverside under the Loan Commitment.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	On November 5, 2013, we paid in full the indebtedness owed to Gaiam under the $1.0 million loan.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	The maturity date for Riverside s loans has been extended until April 26, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	We have not yet made any payments of principal or interest on Riverside s loan and the full amount of the principal remains outstanding.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P34_S5	Furthermore, as required by the Loan Commitment, we executed with Gaiam an option agreement permitting Gaiam to purchase for $200,000 all tenant improvements constructed by us in our principal office space leased from Gaiam and amended our lease to cancel, effective March 28, 2013, the $3 per square foot credit set forth in the current lease.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	the option of converting all or any portion of the principal and the loan into securities in such sale at the same purchase price as paid by other purchasers in such sale.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	If we fail to make payment of the principal and all interest owing on Riverside s loan within 10 days of when due, then Riverside has the option to acquire an undivided 50% interest in our real property located in Hopland, California (including all land and buildings) in exchange for cancellation of such principal and interest (Gaiam had the same option under the terms of its loan, while outstanding).
1425565_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	This option is conditioned upon (a) the approval of the transaction by our disinterested directors, and (b) the consent of our senior creditor, Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Riverside s loans are subordinate to all indebtedness for borrowed money owed by us to any lenders unaffiliated with us.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	Payment of the unpaid principal and all accrued but unpaid interest under a loan is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events related to proceedings under bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar laws, the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for us or a substantial part of our assets, and our making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Riverside owns approximately 22% and 17% of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock, as of December 31, 2013 and March 21, 2014, respectively, and is one of our creditors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Pursuant to the terms of a Shareholders Agreement, Riverside has the right to designate a certain number of individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, tied to its ownership of our Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	At the time of the transactions described above, Gaiam was a related person, as such term is defined under the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	At December 31, 2013, our cash balance was $12.4 million, and our working capital was $13.4 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	As of March 21, 2014, we had $6.5 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	As of March 21, 2014, we had approximately $5.0 million of availability under the revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	We will continue to make operational improvements to reduce our operating cash requirements.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P37_S6	Operational initiatives to reduce costs include productivity enhancements within support functions through greater use of information technology and other process improvements and greater project level control over working capital deployed and labor utilization.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	While there can be no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit, potential security sales under our $200 million self registration, and cash savings through further operational efficiencies should be sufficient to fund our continuing operations and meet our current debt repayment obligations through at least calendar year 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	However, no assurance can be given that we will achieve those objectives.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Further, our projected cash needs may change as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or other factors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	If we encounter unplanned operational difficulties, we may not have sufficient funds to repay any outstanding borrowings when they come due or to fund our operating cash needs.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	These circumstances would require us to obtain financing from another source or raise additional capital through debt financing, equity financing or capital contributions from shareholders, if available to us.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain new financing.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P38_S6	The following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of cash during the periods presented:
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our operating activities used net cash of $16.4 million and $12.7 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our net cash used in operating activities during 2013 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $11.3 million, decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.4 million, increased inventory of $1.0 million and decreased billings in excess of costs of $2.6 million, partially offset by decreased accounts receivable of $2.0 million and increased costs in excess of billings of $732,000.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Our net cash used by operating activities during 2012 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $47.2 million, decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $12.1 million, and decreased deferred revenue and other current liabilities of $2.0 million, partially offset by noncash impairment of intangibles of $22.0 million, deferred income tax benefit of $8.7 million, decreased accounts receivable of $7.6 million and decreased inventory of $6.6 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our investing activities used net cash of $1.7 million and $0.2 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	Our net cash used by investing activities during 2013 was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment for $0.6 million and consideration paid in our acquisition of Syndicated for $1.2 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	Our net cash used by investing activities during 2012 was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment for $0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $0.2 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our financing activities provided net cash of $20.2 million and $11.5 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was primarily the result of net proceeds from the issuance of the common shares during the year in the aggregate amount of $27.3 million and borrowing under the term loan with SVB in the amount of $2.0 million, partially offset by payments on our line of credit of $6.5 million, and repayment in full of our debt to Gaiam in the amount of $2.7 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was primarily the result of borrowings on our line of credit of $6.5 million and loans from related parties of $5.2 million, partially offset by payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $0.4 million.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	In the normal course of our business, we investigate, evaluate and discuss acquisition, joint venture, non-controlling investment, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the solar energy markets.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	For any future investment, acquisition, or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing equity securities, or incurring additional indebtedness.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	While there can be no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, cash raised through debt commitments, cash expected to be generated from operations, cash obtainable from additional investors, and cash savings through further operational efficiencies should be sufficient to fund our continuing operations and meet our current debt repayment obligations through at least calendar year 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	However, our projected cash needs may change as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or other factors.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	We will continue to make operational improvements to reduce our operating cash requirements.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	Operational initiatives to reduce costs include productivity enhancements within support functions through greater use of information technology and other process improvements and greater project level control over working capital deployed and labor utilization.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	We expect to be able to continue to operate through 2014, and have adequate cash flow to meet our debt obligations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	We have commitments under operating leases and various service agreements with Gaiam (see Notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements), but do not have any significant outstanding commitments under long-term debt obligations or purchase obligations.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	The following table shows our commitments to make future payments under our operating leases: To the extent we become entitled to utilize certain loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to our initial public offering, we will distribute to Gaiam the tax effect (estimated to be 34% for federal income tax purposes) of the amount of such tax loss carryforwards so utilized.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S9	Accordingly, we recognized a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of the effective date of our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, May 13, 2008.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P41_S10	These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Due to Gaiam s step acquisitions of our company, we experienced ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Accordingly, our use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited by annual limitations described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	As of December 31, 2013, $46.3 million of these net operating loss carryforwards remained available for current and future utilization, meaning that potential future payments to Gaiam, which would be made over a period of several years, could therefore aggregate to approximately $15.7 million based on current tax rates.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	As a condition of entering into some of our construction contracts, we had surety bonds outstanding of approximately $2.8 million at December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	include changes in U.S. interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We purchase a significant amount of our product inventory from vendors outside of the United States in transactions that are primarily U.S. dollar denominated transactions.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Since the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is small, currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	However, a decline in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies could lead to increased purchasing costs.
1425565_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	In order to mitigate this exposure, we make virtually all of our purchase commitments in U.S. dollars.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent registered public accounting firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Louisville, Colorado We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2013.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Principles of Consolidation, Organization and Nature of Operations Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( RGS or Company ) is a leading residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company was incorporated in Colorado on January 29, 2008 under the name Real Goods Solar, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Company s initial public offering of common stock occurred on May 7, 2008.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P6_S4	On January 15, 2014, the Company began doing business as RGS Energy and changed its ticker symbol to RGSE on February 24, 2014.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	RGS has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which include the Company s accounts and those of its subsidiaries.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Liquidity Update At December 31, 2013, the Company s cash balance was $12.4 million.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	The Company s related party debt of $2.7 million owed to Gaiam, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	( Gaiam ) was repaid on November 5, 2013 while its related party debt of $4.15 million owed to Riverside Renewable Energy Investments, LLC ( Riverside ) was extended; $1.0 million is due April 26, 2014, $3.0 million is due September 3, 2014 and $150,000 is due October 29, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P8_S4	During September, 2013, RGS entered into the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ), which extended the revolving line of credit maturity date to September 29, 2014 and provided RGS with a $2.0 million term loan.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	NASDAQ Non-Compliance During 2012, the Company received four different non-compliance notices from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( NASDAQ ).
1425565_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	The Company regained compliance as of February 21, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	No changes were made to the Company s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Cash Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	The Company makes estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $618,000 and $1.1 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	If the financial condition of our customers or the public utilities or financing companies were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired, additional allowances could be required.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Inventory Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at the Company s various warehouses and finished goods held for sale at its Solar Living Center located in Hopland, California.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	RGS states inventory at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company identifies the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Company writes down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through its current stock level of the inventories.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company estimated obsolete or slow-moving inventory to be $400,000 and $700,000, respectively, net of estimated reserves.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Property and Equipment The Company states property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	RGS amortizes leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	As RGS operates in only one business segment, it assesses impairment at the Company level.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company has the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying amount.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	If it is determined that the fair value of the Company is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	If it is determined that the two-step impairment test is necessary, then for step one, RGS compares the estimated fair value of the Company with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, the Company s goodwill considered not impaired.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss is performed.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	The Company uses either a comparable market approach, traditional present value method, or some combination thereof to test for potential impairment.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about future cash flows.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	These cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates RGS uses to manage its business.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company s goodwill balances were $1.9 million and zero at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and other intangibles balances were $480,000 and zero at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	The other intangibles are comprised of backlog acquired from Syndicated Solar, Inc. and will be amortized to selling and operating expenses over a period of less than 12 months.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company had impaired all goodwill and other intangibles at September 30, 2012 (see Note 4.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012, amortization expense was $0.2 million.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded $1.9 million of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of Syndicated Solar, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P19_S5	There is no amortization expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Purchase Accounting RGS accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	In determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities, the Company makes assumptions based upon historical and other relevant information and, in some cases, reports of independent valuation experts.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	As a result of the acquisition of Syndicated and Mercury Energy, Inc., RGS incurred acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed as incurred, including subsequent adjustments to valuation entries made at the time of the acquisition.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded $2.0 million of such costs.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue are derived primarily from contracts for the installation of solar energy systems.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	RGS recognizes revenue from fixed price contracts using either the completed contract or percentage-of-completion method, based on the size of the energy system installation.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	RGS recognizes revenue from energy system installations of less than 100 kilowatts, or kW, when the installation is substantially complete and recognizes revenue from energy system installations equal to or greater than 100 kW on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company recognizes amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling as revenue at the same time that the revenues arising from the product sale are recognized.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	RGS includes shipping and handling costs, which were approximately $500,000, $500,000, and $100,000 for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, in selling and operating expense along with other fulfillment costs.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S4	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P24_S5	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	RGS bills our large installation customers for contract performance progress according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Unbilled receivables were immaterial at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not yet completed as on the balance sheet date.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Allocation of Costs Historically, Gaiam provided RGS with administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and related office services under the Intercorporate Services Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	During 2013, the Company s reliance on Gaiam for services provided under the Intercorporate Services Agreement decreased to the point that RGS and Gaiam terminated the agreement on December 19, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of these expenses.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	The allocation is based on a combination of factors, including revenue and operating expenses.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	The Company believes the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in an appropriate allocation of costs incurred by Gaiam and its subsidiaries on the Company s behalf.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P27_S5	However, these allocations may not be indicative of the cost of future services as the company operates on a standalone basis.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Share-Based Compensation RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company measures compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 12.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S4	Share-Based Compensation), consisting of the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P28_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Income Taxes RGS provides for income taxes pursuant to the liability method.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company s effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	RGS has significant net operating loss carryforwards and will re-evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether it expects it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company has agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as RGS utilizes certain of its net operating losses in the future (see Note 13.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P30_S3	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P30_S4	RGS measures the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	As such, RGS is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P31_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to the Company s subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The result of the reassessment of the Company s tax positions did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	RGS federal and state tax returns for all years after 2009 are subject to future examination by tax authorities for all our tax jurisdictions.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Net Loss Per Share RGS computes net loss per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares of the Company s Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Weighted average common share equivalents of 7,012,000, 2,173,000 and 1,262,000 shares have been omitted from net loss per share for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share: Concentration of Risk RGS has a potential concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable in that two financing companies that purchase and then lease installed solar energy system to host users and two commercial customers accounted for 24%, 14%, 4% and 2% respectively, of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S4	The Company also has a potential concentration of supply risk in that during 2013 it purchased approximately 30% of the major components for its solar installations from a single supplier.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P33_S5	Sales to the Company s three largest customers for 2013 accounted for approximately 21%, 12% and 6%, respectively, of our total net revenue.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and disclosures.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company accounts for common stock warrants and put options in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 480, Liabilities Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	The common stock warrants are accounted for as a liability due to a provision which allows for the warrant holder to require redemption, at the intrinsic value of the warrant, upon a change of control.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	We classify these derivative liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a long term liability, which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P35_S3	We use a Monte Carlo pricing model to value these derivative liabilities.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Monte Carlo pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	In building the Monte Carlo pricing model, the Company assumed a 15% probability of a change in control and used 20 nodes (See Note 3.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as change in fair value of warrant liability, with an offsetting non-cash entry recorded as interest.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	During 2013, net non-cash credits of approximately $2 million were recorded as interest income to reflect changes in fair value of outstanding warrants.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	In the event warrants are exercised or expire without being exercised, the fair value of the warrant liability is reduced by the number of warrants exercised or expired multiplied by the then fair value of the each warrant.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The tables below summarize warrant activity for 2013 and assumptions utilized to value the warrants (in thousands except for per warrant data): Assumptions used to estimate warrant values:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Mergers and Acquisitions Syndicated Solar, Inc.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	On August 9, 2013, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain current liabilities of Syndicated Solar, Inc. ( Syndicated ).

1425565_14_ITEM8_P42_S4	The accrued liability recorded was $200,000 and zero as of December 31, 2013 and March 21, 2014, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Intangible assets consist of the value of contractual arrangements entered into between Syndicated and its customers to install solar energy systems for which installation had not yet commenced at the acquisition date.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Syndicated also has the potential to earn up to $250,000 in additional earn-out payments following the close of the 2013 fiscal year and an additional 1.3 million shares of unregistered Class A common stock in performance based earn-outs over the period August 9, 2013 to December 31, 2015.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s accounting standards codification, the Company evaluated the realizability of its tangible assets and determined based on market place property comparables (level two of the fair value hierarchy) that a valuation impairment charge of $2.1 million was necessary against the cost of its Hopland California facility at September 30, 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	Additionally, the Company performed impairment analyses of goodwill and other intangibles using the discounted cash flows method and write-offs of $19.7 million of goodwill and $200,000 of other intangibles were made at September 30, 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company estimated the fair value of its business for the goodwill impairment analysis based on the quoted market price for its Class A common stock (level one input of the fair value hierarchy), as adjusted by management s judgmental qualitative factors (level three of the fair value hierarchy).
1425565_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	These noncash impairments were necessitated by the trading price of the Company s Class A common stock, recent operating losses, and financial forecasts.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P46_S4	The $22.0 million of noncash impairment charges are reported in goodwill and other asset impairments on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	(a) During 2012, the Company impaired $2.1 million of its buildings (see Note 4.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan Under a loan agreement, as amended, with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB Loan ), the Company has a revolving line of credit that provides for advances not to exceed $6.5 million based upon a borrowing base of 75% of eligible accounts receivable.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	All borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets other than its interests in Alteris Project Financing Company LLC, and bear interest at the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00% plus 4.75%.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	The interest rate accruing on borrowings during a Streamline Period (as defined in the SVB Loan) is the greater of the bank s prime rate or 4.00% plus 2.00%.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	The original maturity date for the SVB Loan was October 30, 2012 and the maturity date was first extended to March 31, 2013 on October 30, 2012, then to September 30, 2013 on March 27, 2013, and then to September 30, 2014 on September 29, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The line of credit has a facility fee of 0.5% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit during the applicable calendar quarter.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	We may reserve up to $500,000 for stand-by letters of credit under the line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The SVB Loan establishing the line of credit contains various covenants, including a covenant requiring compliance with a liquidity ratio.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	The fourth amendment to the SVB Loan required the borrowers to pay a final payment fee of $60,000 in cash upon termination or maturity of the revolving line of credit, which was reduced to $40,000 following our equity funding during June 2013 of $8.4 million in net proceeds.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company paid the final payment of $40,000 in conjunction with the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	At December 31, 2013, RGS had zero of outstanding borrowings under this facility.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Also under the Fifth Loan Modification Agreement, SVB agreed to extend to RGS a term loan of up to $2.0 million under the terms of the loan agreement (the Term Loan ) in addition to the $6.5 million revolving line of credit.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Term Loan matures on September 29, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	RGS is required to make monthly payments of interest only on the Term Loan and may prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness owed to Gaiam, as required (see Note 8.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	On March 23, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiaries Real Goods Energy Tech, Inc., Real Goods Trading Corporation, Alteris Renewables, Inc. and Real Goods Syndicated, Inc. entered into a Waiver Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank pursuant to which Silicon Valley Bank waived (i) our failure to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant contained in Section 6.9(b) of the Loan Agreement, for the quarterly compliance period ended December 31, 2013, and (ii) testing of the minimum EBITDA financial covenant contained in Section 6.9(b) of the Loan Agreement solely for the quarterly compliance period ending March 31, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	In connection with executing the Waiver Agreement, we paid to Silicon Valley Bank a fee of $10,000.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	As of March 21, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and $2.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan, under the Loan Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Payable to Gaiam The Company is engaged in several related party transactions with Gaiam.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	During 2013, through open market sales of shares by Gaiam, its ownership declined to less than 10% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Historically, the Company has had a need for certain services to be provided by Gaiam under the Intercorporate Services Agreement and Industrial Building Lease Agreement for the Company s corporate headquarters.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	These services may include, but are not limited to, administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and certain occupancy and related office services as required from time to time.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	Previously, the Company determined that it was not cost effective to obtain and separately maintain the personnel and infrastructure associated with these services with a complement of full time, skilled employees.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	The Company significantly reduced its reliance on Gaiam to provide services under the Intercorporate Services Agreement during 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P56_S4	The agreement terminated was on December 19, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	During 2011, the Company completed a project for its then Chairman to design and install an upgrade to an existing solar power system originally built in 1997 for his residence.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The contract price, or revenue recognized, was $244,000, which was priced at a customary rate for work performed for the Company s employees.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Consideration payable to Gaiam and expensed during 2011 for additional services under the Intercorporate Services Agreement and agreeing to amend the existing Intercorporate Services Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement totaled $672,000.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	Related Party Debt Related party debt consists of the following (in thousands): Related party debt at December 31, 2013 consisted of $4.15 million owed to Riverside.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Company s related party debt was comprised of $2.7 million owed to Gaiam and $4.15 million owed to Riverside.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the Riverside loans were due as follows: $1.0 million by April 26, 2014, $3.0 million by September 3, 2014, and $150,000 by October 29, 2014.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S5	These loans bear interest at an annual rate of 10%.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P58_S6	The accrued interest on the amounts owed to Riverside will be waived if the Company repays the $3.0 million and $150,000 loans owed to Riverside on or before their respective maturity date.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	As conditions for Gaiam extending the maturity date of its then existing $1.7 million loan to RGS from December 30, 2012 to April 30, 2013 and loaning RGS an additional $1.0 million, the Company had to pay all interest owed on the then existing Gaiam loan of $1.7 million, execute and deliver to Gaiam in the near future an option agreement, reasonably acceptable to both parties, permitting Gaiam to purchase for $200,000 all tenant improvements constructed by RGS in its principal office space leased from Gaiam; and amend the Company s facility lease with Gaiam to cancel, effective December 31, 2012, the $3 per square foot credit set forth in the then current lease.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	On April 23, 2013, Gaiam converted $100,000 of the then outstanding $2.7 million into 62,111 shares of the Company s Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	The $2.6 million remaining amount due to Gaiam was repaid on November 5, 2013; $2.1 million in cash, $200,000 of tenant improvements transferred to Gaiam and a discount for early repayment of $300,000.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	The discount is included in other accrued liabilities to reflect the above market lease with Gaiam for the Company s headquarters office space.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The $1.0 million promissory note entered into with Riverside during December 2012 included certain customary language making the loan payable upon the occurrence of certain events, such as insolvency or bankruptcy.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Also, if the Company completes a sale of at least $50,000 of capital stock, then Riverside has the option of converting all or any portion of the principal and interest owing on the loan in question into securities in such sale at the same purchase price as paid by other purchasers in such sale.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	This option is conditioned upon (1) the approval of the transaction by the Company s disinterested directors, and (2) the consent of the Company s senior creditor, Silicon Valley Bank.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The loans are unsecured and subordinated to the Company s indebtedness to unaffiliated creditors.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	Subject to the rights of senior debt, RGS has the right to prepay the loans at any time without premium or penalty.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P61_S3	Accrued interest on related party debt is $664,000 and $200,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Riverside owns approximately 22% of the Company s currently outstanding Class A common stock and is one of its creditors.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Pursuant to the terms of a Shareholders Agreement, Riverside has the right to designate a certain number of individuals for appointment or nomination to the Board of Directors, tied to its respective ownership of the Company s Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from three to five years.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	On December 19, 2011, RGS entered into a five year facility lease with Gaiam, for office space located in a Gaiam-owned building in Colorado.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	The lease commenced on January 1, 2012 and provides for monthly payment of approximately $21,832.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	The following schedule represents the annual future minimum payments of all leases:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company incurred rent expense of $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and the seasonal nature of its business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company has accrued for probable and estimable costs that may be incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual costs could vary from the amounts accrued.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Shareholders Equity During 2013, the Company issued 18,517 shares of its Class A common stock under the Real Goods Solar, Inc. 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2008 Incentive Plan ) to certain of its independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	On November 15, 2013, RGS issued 5.9 million shares of its Class A common stock and received proceeds of $18.4 million.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	As part of the offering, RGS issued warrants to purchase 5.0 million shares of its Class A common stock at $3.41 per share, which expire May 15, 2019.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S5	The exercise price was reduced to $2.50 per share in conjunction with the November 15, 2013 issuance of shares and warrants.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S6	Certain anti-dilution protection provisions contained in the warrants were triggered.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P67_S7	Such provisions required the exercise price of the warrants to be reduced and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants to increase, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants after taking into account the Black Scholes and fair market values of the warrants and such anti-dilution protection provisions.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	During 2012, the Company issued 33,056 shares of its Class A common stock under the 2008 Incentive Plan to certain of its independent directors, in lieu of cash compensation, for services rendered during 2012.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Each holder of the Company s Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted all of its holdings of the Company s Class B common stock to Class A common stock and, as a result, RGS has had no shares of Class B common stock outstanding since December 31, 2011.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Under the terms of the Company s articles of incorporation and merger with Alteris, RGS is prohibited from issuing Class B common stock in the future.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	All holders of Class A common stock vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	Accordingly, Riverside, as the holder of approximately 22% of the Class A common stock and entitled to vote in any election of directors, may exert significant influence over the election of the directors.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Holders of the Company s Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	FASB ASC No. 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures- Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 820-10-35 ), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	ASC 820-10-35-3 also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P73_S4	Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	ASC 820-10-35 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
1425565_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	The statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels: Level 1 Inputs Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	An active market is a market in which transactions occur for the item to be fair valued with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level 2 Inputs Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Level 2 inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	These inputs include: (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, such as when there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially over time or in which little information is released publicly; (c) Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and (d) Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	Level 3 Inputs Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S4	These inputs should be used to determine fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P76_S5	Unobservable inputs should be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include internally generated data and assumptions being used to price the asset or liability.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value: Common stock warrant liability: For our level 3 securities, which represent common stock warrants, fair value is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions (See Note 2.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company used a market approach to valuing the derivative liabilities.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, net: For our level 3 assets, which represent assets acquired and liabilities assumed, fair value is based upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions (See Note 2.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company used a market approach to valuing the assets and liabilities.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	Share-Based Compensation The Company s share-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	RGS primarily grants options under its 2008 Incentive Plan, but have also granted 300,000 non-shareholder approved options to its chief executive officer during 2012.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	At December 31, 2013 the Company s 2008 Incentive Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to the lesser of 3,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock or 10% of its then outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	Furthermore, the Board of Directors has resolved that all types of granted options shall not exceed 10% of the then outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Incentive Plan.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, business partners, and certain key advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the Incentive Plan.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Options vest based on service conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in RGS industry and its stock price volatility since our initial public offering.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	RGS does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	RGS is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	RGS primarily uses plan life to-date forfeiture experience rate of 40% to estimate option forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following are the variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under the Company s incentive plans for each of the years presented: The table below presents a summary of our option activity as of December 31, 2013 and changes during the year then ended:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1.13, $0.76 and $1.67, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	The total fair value of shares vested was $305,000, $432,000 and $448,000 during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company s share-based compensation cost charged against income was $509,000, $400,000, and $516,000 during the years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is recorded as general and administrative expenses.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S3	The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $nil, nil and $200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S4	As of December 31, 2013, there was $787,230 of unrecognized cost related to nonvested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P90_S5	The Company expects that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	On January 14, 2014, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P91_S1	The amendment increases the number of options available for grant to 6,704,231, which was 15% of the Company s then outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Income Taxes The Company s provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets shown on a gross basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2013, RGS had $15.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring, if not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	Additionally, the Company had $4.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring, it not utilized, beginning in 2019.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to annual limitation under applicable federal and state ownership change limitations and, accordingly, net operating losses may expire before utilization.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	The company completed a Section 382 analysis through December 2013 and determined that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code occurred in prior years.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The net operating loss carryforwards above have accounted for any limited and potential loss attributes to such ownership changes.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had no amount of unrecognized tax benefits.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized benefits will increase or decrease within 12 months of the year ended December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	As a result of the net operating losses, substantially all of its federal, state and local income tax returns are subject to audit.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S3	The Company s valuation allowance increased by approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of its operating loss for the year.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S4	The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S5	Based upon the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S6	At December 31, 2013, the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected income from the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S7	The Company is required, under the terms of its tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, to distribute to Gaiam the tax effect of certain tax loss carryforwards as utilized by the Company in preparing its federal, state and local income tax returns.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P97_S8	At December 31, 2013, utilizing an income tax rate of 35%, the Company estimates that the maximum amount of such distributions to Gaiam could aggregate $1.6 million.
1425565_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
1425565_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	(a) The quarter ended September 30, 2013 includes one-time cash charges of $555,000 for the integration of Syndicated and other acquisition related expenses.

1425565_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	(d) The quarter ended December 31, 2012 includes a noncash charge of $1.6 million for an additional valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets generated during that quarter.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2013, they have concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1425565_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

1425565_14_ITEM9B_P0_S1	In connection with executing the Waiver Agreement, we paid to Silicon Valley Bank a fee of $10,000.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P0_S2	As of March 21, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and $2.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan, under the Loan Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P1_S0	On March 26, 2013, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) with Elemental Energy LLC, a Hawaii limited liability company doing business as Sunetric ( Sunetric ), and Sunetric s owners, Sean Mullen, Beth-Ann Mullen, and Alexander Tiller (each, a Seller , and collectively, Sellers ), pursuant to which we will purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Sunetric (the Sunetric Acquisition ).
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P2_S0	The purchase price to be paid at the closing for Sunetric consists of: (i) $7,000,000 in cash (less any amount required to pay off any indebtedness or liens), and (ii) a number of shares of our Class A common stock resulting from dividing $9,000,000 by the volume weighted average of the per share price of our Class A common stock on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days ending two days before the public announcement of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, in each case subject to the working capital adjustment and holdback described below.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P2_S1	In addition, the Sellers have the potential to earn up to $3,000,000 in additional earn-out payments, with $1,000,000 payable in shares of our Class A common stock and $2,000,000 payable in cash, to be delivered in the future upon achievement, if at all, of certain revenue and income earn-out targets for 2014 and 2015.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S0	The purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S1	Sunetric s working capital will be estimated for purposes of determining any adjustment to the cash portion of the purchase price paid at the closing.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S2	If the amount of estimated working capital at the closing is higher or lower than the working capital target set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the cash portion of the purchase price paid at the closing will be increased or decreased on a dollar for dollar basis, as the case may be.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S3	After the closing, the parties will determine Sunetric s actual working capital and, if necessary, true-up the cash and stock portions of the purchase price paid at the closing.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S4	At the closing, a portion of the cash purchase price equal to $1,050,000, and a portion of the purchase price paid in our Class A common stock equal to a number of shares resulting from dividing 1,350,000 by the volume weighted average of the per share price of our Class A common stock on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days ending two days before the public announcement of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, will be held back to secure Sellers indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S5	On the six-month anniversary of the closing date, we are obligated to pay to the Sellers 50% of the balance of the holdback amount, pro-rata between the cash purchase price and the stock purchase price, less the aggregate amount of any unresolved indemnification claims.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S6	On the 12-month anniversary of the closing date, we are obligated to pay to the Sellers the balance of the holdback amount less the amount of any unresolved indemnification claims.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S7	Each of RGS Energy, Sunetric and the Sellers have made customary representations, warranties and agreed to customary covenants and indemnification obligations in the Purchase Agreement.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S8	The consummation of the Sunetric Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, (a) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, (b) performance in all material respects of each party of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, and (c) our obtaining Silicon Valley Bank s consent to the transaction.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S9	The Purchase Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both us and the Sellers, including our right to terminate the Purchase Agreement if Silicon Valley Bank does not consent to the transaction, which right, if exercised, would obligate us to reimburse the Sellers for their transaction expenses in an amount of up to $100,000.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S10	Contemporaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we executed employment offer letters with two of the sellers, Sean Mullen and Alexander Tiller, pursuant to which we will employ them, conditioned on the closing of the Sunetric Acquisition, to assist with the orderly transition of Sunetric s business for a specified transitional period.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P3_S11	In addition, all of the Sellers have agreed to certain two-year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement, effective upon the closing.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P4_S0	The issuance of our Class A common stock in connection with the Sunetric Acquisition is not a public offering as defined in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and meets the requirements to qualify for exemption under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
1425565_14_ITEM9B_P4_S1	The Sellers represented in writing that they are accredited investors and will acquire the securities for their own accounts for investment purposes.

1425565_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	RGS Energy s ( RGS , we , us , or the Company ) provides solar energy systems to homeowners and small commercial building owners in the United States.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We believe that solar energy adoption is only in the early stages and that the adoption of solar energy systems will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	RGS and its predecessors have been providing solar energy systems to customers since 1978 and installed tens of thousands of such systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	We endeavor to make the move to solar simple for customers by managing and executing the process with our teams.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	We design and offer a suitable product, then procure, permit, install, and connect them to the grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	After the system is fully operational we provide a comprehensive 10 year warranty on the systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	Our goals are to (i) provide solar solutions that save residential and small commercial customers money and (ii) operate our Company at a profit.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P1_S5	Our strategies to achieve these goals are:
1425565_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Remain in geographic areas that allow us to provide electricity savings to customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Currently we install in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii, and California.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	These states typically have higher utility rates, additional local incentives and rebates, high customer return on investment, and/or favorable utility and government policies.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	During the past two years we have built a call center in our headquarters in Louisville, Colorado to conduct sales via the phone and internet.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	This allows us to cost-effectively reach potential customers and easily enter new markets.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Call center personnel have access to engineering, operations, customer support and other services personnel in Louisville allowing them to quickly address any questions that arise during the sales process.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Many prospective customers request a face-to-face meeting, so we utilize field sales staff in locations where it is cost-effective to do so, particularly in the North Eastern United States.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Continue to drive growth through referrals networks We pay customers for referring additional customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We will continue to expand these programs through the call center, post install in-home parties, user friendly software, and internet marketing.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Installation capacity needs to match sales demand around the country to install solar systems with the shortest cycle time possible.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our installations are performed by both in-house crews and our authorized integrator network.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Expand our financing options for customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We refer our customers to a variety of options for financing solar energy systems including home improvement loans, equipment leases and power purchase agreements.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2014 we began offering our own lease financing so that we could develop a portfolio of these assets and reduce our financing costs.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	Our Competitive Strengths We believe our clients select us because:
1425565_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	We have been in the solar industry for over 35 years.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our customers can utilize cash, loan, and leasing/power purchase agreements.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	We are located in states where utility costs are high , therefore offering an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	Description of our Services We offer turnkey solar energy systems, including design, engineering, financing, procurement, permitting, installing, grid interconnection, monitoring, and maintenance.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	We install residential and small commercial systems generally between 3 kilowatts, or kW, and 200 kW in size, depending on the amount of electricity used by the customer and the size of their building.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	The average solar energy system is approximately 6 kW. We maintain a service department to manage service and repairs.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	We design and build our solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average electricity rates to size the solar system and engineer its interconnection to the grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar photovoltaic ( PV ) modules.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory, rate structures, customer s budget, preferred financing method and the customer s aesthetic preferences.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates and various other factors.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S5	We assess this data using estimated solar production tools and analytical calculations, which enable us to design a solar system to a size and configuration.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S6	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit which is necessary for state incentive rebate processing.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P11_S7	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis and determine the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	As soon as the building permit is approved, our in-house construction teams and/or authorized integrators begin the installation by placing metal racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the solar PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	We do not custom manufacture solar PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	After the solar PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction and at the same time apply to the local utility company to interconnect the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The largest portion of solar energy systems are the modules which transform the sunlight into electrical current.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The electrical current then travels to the inverter which is the second largest component in cost of the solar energy system.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The inverter converts the electrical current into useable electricity that matches the current of the utility grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	The electricity created can go onto the grid or be used by the customer to power household items such as lights and appliances.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	The other major components are the metal racking which holds the solar modules in place on the roof or ground, the monitoring which tracks the solar production of the system, and balance of system which includes clamps and electrical parts which allow the electrical tie-in to transpire.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S5	We do not manufacture any of the components.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S6	We purchase all components from manufacturer or distributors of the manufacturers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S7	Warranty Terms We offer a warranty up to 10 year for parts and labor, which covers property damage arising from the installation.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S8	Substantially all major equipment installed in a PV system array is covered under transferable manufacturers warranties, which are generally up to 25 years.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P13_S9	Customer claims are processed through our customer service department and we are typically reimbursed by the manufacturers for our labor and materials.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Financing We offer customers a choice to finance their solar systems with their cash, third party loans, and Company and third party leases or power purchase agreements.

1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to sustainable energy.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations up to 15kW in size.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	Our small commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service and municipal services.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S5	Our small commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally up to 200kW in size.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S6	Suppliers Our solar energy systems utilize solar panels and inverters purchased from several manufacturers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S7	We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S8	We purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S9	We believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S10	We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil based alternatives.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S11	We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S12	The other source of competition comes from turnkey solar providers that offer solar products that can save similar customers money from the traditional electric utility in the same geographic regions.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P22_S13	These companies consist of SolarCity Corporation, Vivint Solar Inc., NRG Home Solar, Sunrun Inc., Verengo, Inc., Sungevity, Inc., and many others.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Regulations To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity utility.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection agreements are between the local utility and our customer.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We maintain a utility administration function, with primary responsibility for engaging with utilities and ensuring our compliance with interconnection rules.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	We expend significant resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any public works construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our in-house personnel monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Although interconnection is typically supported by the state and utility, we are currently having difficulty achieving interconnection approval in Hawaii.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	This is affecting our ability to build out our backlog and grow sales in Hawaii.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Government Incentives U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Internal Revenue Code allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2016.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	This credit is scheduled to decline to 10% for business income taxpayers and expire for personal income taxpayers, effective January 1, 2017.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	More than half of U.S. states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Some states have established limits on net metering.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	For example, California investor-owned utilities are currently required to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds 5% of the utilities aggregate customer peak demand.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	However, California recently enacted legislation that establishes a process and timeline for development of a new program with no participation cap that will apply after the current 5% cap is reached.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	Other states, such as New York and Massachusetts, increased their respective limits on net metering in 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest sales quarter of the year.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather, especially in the northeast.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	As of March 23, 2015, we had approximately 244 full-time and 2 part-time employees.
1425565_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	U.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	This credit is due to decline to 10% for business income taxpayers and to expire for personal income tax payers in 2017.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties We typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	A drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Existing rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Some utilities also restrict the amount of consumer-owned electricity generation that can be placed on a circuit and the may require special studies or equipment before such generation can be connected to the utility grid.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems, deter purchases of solar energy systems and require investment in the research and development of solar energy technology.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, in 2013 and 2014, Hawaiian Electric, the electric utility on Oahu, imposed new rules and procedures for the interconnection of solar systems on circuits with a high penetration of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	These new rules and procedures have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of on-site solar energy systems being sold or interconnected in Oahu in 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Similar actions by utilities in other markets could have a similar effect.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Such changes are under consideration in markets in which we operate, such as California.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For projects where we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis or payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	For projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis and, as a result, our revenue from these installations is driven by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although we generally build payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We experience spikes in orders in the Spring and Summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the Summer and Fall.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and the tax appetite of customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to construct systems outdoors can be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and cash flow.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, California and Hawaii.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting Our independent auditor audited our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the first time, in connection with the year ended December 31, 2014 and identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, additional costs to remediate and potentially an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Furthermore, if we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial results or prevent fraud from occurring.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If our revenue levels decrease or if we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $146.7 million as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs, and be unable to obtain necessary funding.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	If our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our offering of units of our Class A common stock and warrants in February 2015, the 2015 offering , are insufficient to meet our obligations, we could be required to sell additional equity securities or refinance our obligations and may be unable to do so.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Competitors with superior access to capital may have a significant advantage over us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain adequate and timely financing for expansion and acquisitions.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The solar installation industry is highly fragmented and continues to move toward consolidation.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater capital resources than we have.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we do not have available capital, for example, as a result of our inability to produce cash flow or obtain financing on acceptable terms, when acquisition opportunities arise, may preclude us from competing for available acquisition opportunities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, future financings or other sources to meet our debt service obligations, cash requirements to fund operations or other liquidity needs.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our failure to meet our debt service obligations or pay our indebtedness when it comes due may cause us to become insolvent, which would cast doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	make payments on or amend any subordinated obligations Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our failure to realize cost savings from restructuring and optimization could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In an attempt to realize efficiencies and cost savings, we are in the process of restructuring and optimizing our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We may be unable to effectively complete such restructuring and optimization efforts.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Furthermore, we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expenses, and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequences.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S11	As a result, our restructuring and optimization efforts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S13	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S14	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S15	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S16	We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S17	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S18	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P21_S19	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Litigation claims have also been made against us by investors in our July 2014 private placement.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S8	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P22_S10	We rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers and vendors, to some of which we owe significant past due balances, and if these suppliers and vendors become unwilling to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There have been times in our history when we have had significant outstanding balances and have been in arrears with many of our suppliers and vendors.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	When these circumstances existed, many of these suppliers and vendors were no longer willing to provide products or services to us, and placed us on credit hold , or were requiring payment in advance.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted companies such as us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Shortages of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules we use in our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Shortages of silicon cause the prices for solar photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	A substantial portion of the solar photovoltaic modules used in the United States are sourced from foreign suppliers and rules and conditions affecting international trade can have an adverse effect on the supply of solar photovoltaic modules and their cost.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	A significant percentage of PV modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2014 were sourced from domestic manufacturers, we experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	access to proprietary materials or systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Solar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and also maintains insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Availability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price our solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Third-party financing sources also charge significant fees for their financing products.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In 2014 we introduced our own financing option in selective markets.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance the majority of our sales of solar energy systems.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S7	In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S10	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S11	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S12	Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S13	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S14	We must meet The NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S15	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S16	We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P38_S17	Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	As previously disclosed, on December 15, 2014, we received notice from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid-price rule.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We have 180 calendar days, or until June 15, 2015, to regain compliance.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we have not regained compliance by that date, and if certain conditions are met, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Further, on February 13, 2015, we publicly disclosed that, due to an impairment charge for the fourth quarter of 2014, as reported we have negative shareholders equity as of December 31, 2014, which would also constitute a violation of the NASDAQ continuing listing requirements.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S5	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P39_S7	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We expect to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on May 12, 2015 to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved we expect will (i) cause our stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement and (ii) cause us to have a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock available for future warrant exercises.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	There can be no assurance our shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The SEC rules and the NASDAQ Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These fluctuations may include a so-called bubble market in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of the Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of the Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Our recently completed 2015 Offering includes warrants to purchase more than 30 million shares of our Class A common stock based on our current expectations.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S7	The number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants increases when the price of our Class A common stock declines.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S8	The Warrants issued in the 2015 Offering require us to send instructions to our transfer agent within one trading day of receipt of an exercise notice, and require us to deliver the number of shares of our Class A common stock requested within three trading days of receipt of the exercise notice, provided that we have received the exercise price for such shares.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S9	The exercise price of the warrant shares may be significantly less than the market price of our Class A common stock at the time of exercise.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S10	If we are unable to deliver the shares of Class A common stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holder for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the exercise and sale of such shares.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P43_S11	We are also obligated to pay the holder in cash if we do not have sufficient shares of our Class A common stock available to fulfill an exercise notice.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, as of March 23 , 2015, there were an aggregate of approximately 55.1 million shares of Class A common stock that may be issued upon exercise or conversion of other outstanding options to purchase our Class A common stock under our 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan and warrants or other agreements.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We also have two effective shelf registration statements, one covering approximately $5.0 million aggregate offering price of securities, and another covering approximately $182.8 million aggregate offering price of securities, under which we may issue additional securities in the future (in each case, all of which could be issued as shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Class A common stock).
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The warrants issued in our 2015 Offering also contains anti-dilution protection reducing the exercise price but not directly increasing the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	However, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B warrants issued in our 2015 Offering is calculated by dividing a stated dollar value by an exercise price.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S6	As a result, if the exercise price is reduced, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series B warrants increases.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S7	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P44_S9	Securities analysts may not continue to cover our Class A common stock, and this may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock s market price.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We do not have any control over these analysts.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If our stock is downgraded by a securities analyst, our stock price would likely decline.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If the analyst ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on the Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.

1425565_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous.

1425565_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Risk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam and Riverside Riverside has influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Riverside holds approximately 15% of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Riverside s ownership may increase, stay the same or decrease depending on the amount of shares of Class A common stock we issue in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Riverside currently has the right to designate two individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Because of Riverside s voting rights and its ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, Riverside will be able to exert influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares authorized for issuance under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Accordingly, shares of our Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Riverside did not maintain voting significance over us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Riverside is not prohibited from selling a significant interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S8	Our historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S9	Our historical financial information for periods when Gaiam controlled us does not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S10	The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S11	These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S12	The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, or what they will be in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P52_S13	We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.
1425565_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Possible future sales of shares by Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.

1425565_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	The following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is for our continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a residential and small commercial solar energy engineering, procurement and construction firm.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	We also perform most of our own sales and marketing activities to generate leads and secure projects.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through its current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting unit against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P20_S7	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The cost of an acquisition, including any contingent consideration, is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	The excess of the cost of the acquisition over our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Further, acquisition tax benefits we obtain from acquired companies are recognized in operating income as changes in our tax valuation allowance for our previously existing deferred tax assets.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, property and equipment and any other significant assets or liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period (up to one year) as we finalize the initial valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Share-Based Compensation RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition for performance based awards or over a service period for time based awards.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 12.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Income Taxes We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carry-forward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P28_S5	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Net revenue .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Net revenue increased $13.1 million, or 22.8%, to $70.8 million during 2014 from $57.7 million during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The increase in revenue reflects an increase in solar systems constructed to 17.0 megawatts in 2014 from 14.4 megawatts in 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net revenue for our residential segment increased $1.9 million, or 3.6%, to $55.8 million during 2014 from $54.0 million during 2013, primarily due to our full integration of Syndicated Solar and organic growth from our sales and construction organization.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	Net revenue for our Sunetric segment was $12.7 million and represents the installment of 2.7 megawatts since we acquired it on May 14, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	Gross profit decreased $1.5 million, or 10.6%, to $12.8 million during 2014 from $14.3 million during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S6	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 6.7% during 2014 from 24.7% during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S7	The decline in gross margin is attributable to: (i) less income from 1603 Safe Harbor transactions available during 2014 (for those transactions, the equipment is purchased directly by the customer from the supplier, and the margin is a higher percentage of the reduced amount of revenue recognized), (ii) a strengthening of our liability for warranty reserves, (iii) less gross profit from the catalog segment, and (iv) charges for reducing inventory to lower of cost or market, off-set by an increase of $1.7 million of gross profit from Sunetric since our acquisition during 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S8	Selling and operating expenses increased $8.4 million, or 44.9%, to $27.2 million during 2014 from $18.8 million during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S9	The increase in Selling and Operating expenses is attributable to: (i) the acquisition of Sunetric, approximately $1.8 million, (ii) an increase in indirect payroll and burden of approximately $2.6 million, (iii) marketing of $1.5 million and (iv) $2.5 million of other costs.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S10	As a percentage of net revenue, selling and operating expenses increased to 38.4% during 2014 from 32.5% during 2013.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S12	General and Administrative Expense increased by approximately $2.5 million attributable to: (i) an increase in accounting and legal fees in part due to the company being classified as an accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), (ii) headcount additions from acquisitions, (iii) executive bonuses, and (iv) an increase in stock option expense.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S13	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 13.7 % during 2014 from 12.0% during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S14	Acquisition costs during 2014 were approximately $0.8 million related to the acquisition of Sunetric as compared to approximately $1.0 million related to the acquisition of Syndicated during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P30_S15	Restructuring costs were approximately $0.6 million during 2014 for costs incurred by management s decision to seek cost efficiencies and severance paid to departing executives.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill and other asset impairments .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Goodwill and other asset impairments were approximately $11.8 million during 2014, comprised of approximately $10.4 million of goodwill related to Sunetric and approximately $1.3 million of real property and inventories related to the catalogue segment.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	There were no impairment charges during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Interest and other expense, net .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Interest and other expense, net increased approximately $0.2 million to $1.2 million during 2014 from $0.9 million during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The increase is primarily attributable to our bank term loan that matured on September 30, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Change in valuation of warrants .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	We recorded a noncash gain of $14.2 million during 2014 and $2.0 million during 2013 primarily due to decreasing stock prices resulting in adjustments to the fair value of the common stock warrant liability.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Income tax benefit was $1.2 million for 2014, represented primarily by tax benefits realized from the acquisition of Sunetric.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	State income tax expense was $58,000 for 2013, representing state income taxes not offset by the loss from operations.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	As a result of the above factors, our net loss from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $26.3 million, or $(0.55) per share, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $12.3 million, or $(0.42) per share, during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Our net loss from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30.9 million, or $(0.64) per share, as compared to a net gain from discontinued operations of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S6	The results of the Discontinued segment declined approximately $31.9 million attributable to: (i) a goodwill impairment of $18.8 million as we did not realize the cost synergies we expected from our acquisition of a commercial installer, (ii) a $1.3 million provision for doubtful accounts, (iii) stock option expense of approximately $1.6 million, (iv) approximately $1.6 million of acquisition costs incurred and (v) operating losses related to the competitive environment, contract disputes and liquidating damages incurred, all resulting in a negative gross margin for the contracts during the year.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S7	As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $57.1 million, or $(1.19) per share, during 2014 compared to $11.3 million, or $(0.38) per share, during 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S8	Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net revenue .

1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S10	The increase in revenue reflects an increase in solar systems constructed to 14.4 megawatts in 2013 from 10.0 megawatts in 2012.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S11	Gross profit decreased $1.7 million, or 10.8%, to $14.3 million during 2013 from $16.0 million during 2012.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S12	As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 24.7% during 2013 from 36.3% during 2012.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S13	The decline in gross profit reflects competitive pricing pressure as well as the adverse impact of inclement weather on labor utilization efficiency.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P33_S14	Selling and operating expenses decreased $4.1 million, or 17.9%, to $18.8 million during 2013 from $22.9 million during 2012.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increase is primarily attributable to our bank term loan.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Change in valuation of warrants .
1425565_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	We recorded noncash income of $2.0 million during 2013 primarily due to decreasing stock prices resulting in adjustments to the fair value of the common stock warrant liability.

1425565_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Liquidity and Capital Resources Trends in liquidity and cash flow Our trend in cash flow for the prior three years is as follows:
1425565_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our recurring negative cash flow from operations:
1425565_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Has been funded by raising new capital in the public and private markets.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Arose to a material extent during 2014 due to our acquisition of Mercury for which we did not realize the anticipated synergies, along with a competitive market environment.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Mercury is included in our Discontinued Operations as of September 30, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Arose from increases in selling and operating expenses as well as increases in general and administrative expenses relating to our acquisition program and investment in sales and marketing to grow revenue.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had cash and available borrowings aggregating $3.0 million.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	As of March 23, 2015, we had cash and available borrowings aggregating $5.4 million.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	As a result of these losses:
1425565_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	We were in technical default of certain covenants contained in its credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) both as of September 30, 2014 and as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	As discussed in Note 17, we obtained a waiver of the technical default at September 30, 2014 and the terms of the credit facility were amended to reduce the borrowing base by $1 million.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Subsequent Events, during March 2015, we extended both its loan with SVB and subordinated debt owed to Riverside through March 2016.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	In connection with the extension of its loan with SVB, the requirement to reduce the borrowing base by $1 million was eliminated.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	We did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from its equipment suppliers.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate backlog of signed contracts for its Residential Segment of approximately $40 million, which it was not able to install in a timely manner, as our access to equipment was limited.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	We, starting with the fourth quarter of 2014, implemented measures to reduce our cash outflow from operations and, for the fourth quarter, we had positive cash flow from operations of $0.6 million.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for its products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Although the company was successful during the fourth quarter in managing cash, the borrowing base amendment described above and limited vendor terms limited the company s ability to convert its backlog.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result of these circumstances, the company arranged for additional capital as discussed below for the purposes of (i) obtaining a one-year extension of its credit facility for one year, which was renewed during the first quarter of 2015, and (ii) providing additional liquidity to repay equipment suppliers and have access to equipment; by the end of the first quarter of 2015 the company had made payments to vendors and began to have access to equipment.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	On February 26 and 27, 2015, we raised gross proceeds of $3.5 million in the initial closings of the 2015 Offering.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Over the next 12 months we can raise up to an additional $8.0 million either through (i) the forced exercise of a portion of the Class B warrants issued in the 2015 Offering, provided that it is in compliance with the equity conditions and other terms specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the warrants or (ii) voluntary exercise by the Class B warrant holders.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	As of March 23, 2015, we have realized $2.9 million from the Class B warrants solely by voluntary exercises by the Class B warrant holders, or 36% of the amount available.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	We anticipate further voluntary exercises by Class B warrant holders.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	We have the right to force the exercise of any unexercised warrants for cash other than certain retail investors of approximately $1.1 million who have the option of terminating their warrants in lieu of cash payment; however, as of March 23, 2014, the retail investors have made voluntary exercises of $0.5 million.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	In addition, we will raise additional capital through the voluntary exercise of Series A and Series C warrants.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	We have prepared our business plan for 2015 and believe we have sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12-month period from December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	Our objectives in preparing this plan included (i) further reducing its fixed operating cost infrastructure commencing during the first quarter of 2015 in order to reduce the required level of revenue for profitable operations and (ii) reducing our present operating losses and returning the company to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, of which substantially all had been achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2015, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) moving towards an optimized field and e-sales force, (iv) optimizing our construction capability through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of our backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, and (vi) continued internal efforts to convert our accounts receivable to cash.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S9	We believe that as a result of (i) raising access to additional capital of $11.5 million, of which 56% has been realized through March 23, 2015, (ii) renewing our credit facilities on improved terms for the ensuing 12 months, and (iii) the actions we has already implemented to reduce its fixed operating cost infrastructure, we have sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S10	In the event that as a result of presently unforeseen circumstances our plan would not be sufficient to operate, we would enact further cost reductions and or raise additional capital.
1425565_15_ITEM7_P44_S11	NASDAQ Non-Compliance In December 2014, we received a notice from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with maintaining a minimum bid price of $1 per share for which we have 180 days to regain compliance.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	Financial Reporting and Close Processes: The Company has not maintained a sufficient complement of qualified corporate accounting personnel which has resulted in the ineffective design or operation of the Company s internal controls over account balances and financial reporting.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Discontinued Operations On September 30, 2014, the Company committed to a strategic shift of its business resulting in a plan to sell certain net contracts and rights, and completion of remaining substantially completed contracts over the following twelve months comprising its large commercial installations business.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	At the same time, the Company determined not to enter into further contracts.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Contracts in process at December 31, 2014 will be completed during 2015.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P17_S3	Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, operating results, and operating and investing activities cash flows for the entire Commercial segment are presented as a discontinued operation, separate from the Company s continuing operations, for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and footnotes, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Liquidity Update At December 31, 2014, the Company had cash and available borrowings aggregating $3.0 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	As of March 23, 2015, the Company had cash and available borrowings aggregating $5.4 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	As a result of these losses:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company was in technical default of certain covenants contained in its credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) both as of September 30, 2014 and as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	As discussed in Note 17, the Company obtained a waiver of the technical default at September 30, 2014 and the terms of the credit facility were amended to reduce the borrowing base by $1 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	Subsequent Events, during March 2015, the Company extended both its loan with SVB and subordinated debt owed to Riverside Renewable Energy Investment LLC ( Riverside ) through March 2016.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	In connection with the extension of its loan with SVB, the requirement to reduce the borrowing base by $1 million was eliminated.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from its equipment suppliers.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	At December 31, 2014, the Company had an aggregate backlog of signed contracts for its Residential Segment of approximately $40 million, which it was not able to install in a timely manner, as its access to equipment was limited.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company, starting with the fourth quarter of 2014, implemented measures to reduce its cash outflow from operations and, for the fourth quarter, the company had positive cash flow from operations of $0.6 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for its products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Although the company was successful during the fourth quarter in managing cash, the borrowing base amendment described above and limited vendor terms limited the company s ability to convert its backlog.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	As a result of these circumstances, the company arranged for additional capital as discussed below for the purposes of (i) obtaining a one-year extension of its credit facility, which was renewed during the first quarter of 2015, and (ii) providing additional liquidity to repay equipment suppliers and have access to equipment.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	By the end of the first quarter of 2015 the Company has made payments to vendors and began to have access to equipment.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	On February 26 and 27, 2015, the Company raised gross proceeds of $3.5 million in the initial closings of the 2015 Offering.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Over the next 12 months the Company can raise up to an additional $8.0 million either through (i) the forced exercise of a portion of the Class B warrants issued in the 2015 Offering, provided that it is in compliance with the equity conditions, which the Company would be in compliance with as of March 30, 2015 the first day on which the company is eligible to force an exercise of the Series B warrants, and other terms specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the warrants or (ii) voluntary exercise by the Class B warrant holders.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	The equity conditions include, among other items (i) that the company s stock is trading at or above $0.20, (ii) that the company is listed on The NASDAQ Capital market or other eligible market, (iii) that 200% of the shares of Class A comment stock subject to an exercise notice is issuable, and (iv) the dollar trading volume of the Class A common stock for each day during the 30 preceding days of an exercise is at least $100,000.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S3	As of March 23, 2015, the company has realized $2.9 million from the Class B warrants solely by voluntary exercises by the Class B warrant holders, or 36% of the amount available.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S4	The Company anticipates further voluntary exercises by Class B warrant holders.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P23_S5	The Company has the right to force the exercise of any unexercised warrants for cash other than certain retail investors of approximately $1.1 million who have the option of terminating their warrants in lieu of cash payment to the company; however, as of March 23, 2014, the retail investors have made voluntary exercises of $0.5 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company has prepared its business plan for 2015 and believes it has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12-month period from December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company objectives in preparing this plan included (i) further reducing its fixed operating cost infrastructure commencing during the first quarter of 2015 in order to reduce the required level of revenue for profitable operations and (ii) reducing the company s present operating losses and returning the company to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, of which substantially all had been achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2015, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) moving towards an optimized field and e-sales force, (iv) optimizing the Company s construction capability through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of the Company s backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, and (vi) continued internal efforts to convert the Company s accounts receivable to cash.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company believes that as a result of (i) raising access to additional capital of $11.5 million, of which 56% has been realized through March 23, 2015, (ii) renewing its credit facilities on improved terms for the ensuing 12 months, and (iii) the actions it has already implemented to reduce its fixed operating cost infrastructure, the Company has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S4	In the event that as a result of presently unforeseen circumstances the Company s plan would not be sufficient to operate, the Company would enact further cost reductions and or raise additional capital.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S5	In December 2014, the Company received a notice from NASDAQ that it was not in compliance with maintaining a minimum bid price of $1 per share for which we have 180 days to regain compliance.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S6	The Company will hold a special meeting of shareholders on May 12, 2015 to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved would (i) cause the stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement and (ii) cause the Company to have a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock for future warrant exercises.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S7	There can be no assurance that the shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P24_S8	No changes were made to the Company s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P25_S3	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P25_S4	The reclassifications did not impact prior period results of operations, cash flows, total assets, total liabilities or total equity.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	The excess of the cost of the acquisition over our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), trademarks, and non-compete agreements are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P33_S7	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kilowatts (kW), the Company recognizes revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Components comprise of photovoltaic panels and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	For those systems of 100kw or greater, or commercial customers the Company recognizes revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of labor costs incurred to date to total projected labor costs.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company invoices large installation customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Unbilled receivables were included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Allocation of Costs Historically, Gaiam provided RGS with administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and related office services under the Intercorporate Services Agreement.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	During 2013, the Company s reliance on Gaiam for services provided under the Intercorporate Services Agreement decreased to the point that RGS and Gaiam terminated the agreement on December 19, 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The accompanying financial statements include an allocation of these expenses.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	The allocation is based on a combination of factors, including revenue and operating expenses.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Company believes the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in an appropriate allocation of costs incurred by Gaiam and its subsidiaries on the Company s behalf.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P44_S5	However, these allocations may not be indicative of the cost of future services as the company operates on a standalone basis.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Share-Based Compensation RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company measures compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 12.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P45_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Income Taxes The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company s effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	RGS has significant net operating loss carryforwards and will re-evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether it expects it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company has agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as RGS utilizes certain of its net operating losses in the future (see Note 13.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	RGS measures the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	As such, RGS is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to the Company s subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Net Loss per Share RGS computes net loss per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares of the Company s Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Weighted average common share equivalents of 10,916,000, 7,012,000 and 2,173,000 shares have been omitted from net loss per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Concentration of Risk RGS has a potential concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable in that one financing company that purchases and then leases installed solar energy system to host users and one commercial customer accounted for 12% and 18% respectively, of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company also has a potential concentration of supply risk in that during 2014 it purchased approximately 53% of the major components for its solar installations from two suppliers.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	During 2014 the Company had one customer, representing over 10% of sales.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	This customer was SEC SUSD Solar One, LLC, an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc., a customer included in its Discontinued Operations, and represented 24% of consolidated revenue.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Segment Information Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company s chief operating decision maker is the executive team.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate the resources and in assessing the performance of the Company, the Company has determined that it has three reporting segments: residential solar installations, retail and corporate operations, and Sunetric installations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company accounts for common stock warrants and put options in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 480, Liabilities Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The common stock warrants are accounted for as a liability due to a provision which allows for the warrant holder to require redemption, at the intrinsic value of the warrant, upon a change of control.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	We classify these derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as a long term liability, which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	The Company uses a Monte Carlo pricing model to value these derivative liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Monte Carlo pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	In building the Monte Carlo pricing model, the Company assumed a 15% probability of a change in control and used 20 nodes (See Note 11.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in fair value of warrant liability, with an offsetting non-cash entry recorded as an adjustment to the warrant liability.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The change in the fair value recorded for the fourth quarter of 2014 was based upon a valuation conducted by a third party.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company used the following assumptions for its common stock warrants.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	(b) The warrants issued on June 3, 2013 had an original exercise price of $2.75.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The warrants contain an anti-dilution provision that requires the Company to adjust the number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock underlying the warrants and the exercise price in the event a subsequent funding transaction results in dilution of the shares.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	In conjunction with the November 15, 2013 warrant issuance, the exercise price of the June 3, 2013 warrants was adjusted to $2.50 and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable increased by 172,111 as a result of the anti-dilution provision.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	Then, related to the July 9, 2014 warrant issuance, the previously adjusted exercise price was adjusted again to $2.45 and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable was increased by another 31,859 as a result of the anti-dilution provision.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	(c) The risk-free rate is based on the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates, as calculated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, for borrowings of the same term.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The tables below summarize warrant activity for 2014 and assumptions utilized to value the warrants (in thousands except for per warrant data):
1425565_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	Changes to the warrant valuations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are shown below.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The table below summarizes the Company s warrant activity for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	To reflect changes in the fair values of its outstanding warrants, the Company recorded its common stock warrant liability, net of noncash charges of $14.2 million decrease, $2.0 million decrease and zero during the years ended December 31 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	In the event warrants are exercised or expire without being exercised, the fair value is reduced by the number of warrants exercised or expired multiplied by the fair value of each warrant at the time of exercise or expiration, with a credit to additional paid-in capital.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	Residential Leases To determine lease classification, the Company evaluates lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life, or whether the present value of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	All of the Company s leased systems are treated as sales-type leases under U.S. GAAP accounting policies.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Financing receivables are generated by solar energy systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	Financing receivables represents gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term of up to 20 years and the systems estimated residual value, net of allowance for estimated losses.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Initial direct costs for sales-type leases are recognized as cost of sales when the solar energy systems are placed in service.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	For systems classified as sales-type leases, the net present value of the minimum lease payments, net of executory costs, is recognized as revenue when the lease is placed in service.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	This net present value as well as the net present value of the residual value of the lease at termination are recorded as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P66_S3	The difference between the initial net amounts and the gross amounts are amortized to revenue over the lease term using the interest method.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The residual values of our solar energy systems are determined at the inception of the lease applying an estimated system fair value at the end of the lease term.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	RGS considers the credit risk profile for its lease customers to be homogeneous due to the criteria the Company uses to approve customers for its residential leasing program, which among other things, requires a minimum fair FICO credit quality.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Accordingly, the Company does not regularly categorize its financing receivables by credit risk.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards ASU 2014-08 On April 10, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 ( ASU 2014-08 ), Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	The amendments in the ASU change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	It also addresses sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S3	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S4	Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization s operations and financial results.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S5	Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S6	In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S7	The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S8	This disclosure will provide users with information about the ongoing trends in a reporting organization s results from continuing operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S9	The amendments in ASU 2014-08 are effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2015.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S10	The Company has early adopted ASU 2014-08, as permitted on a prospective basis, applying its guidance to the Company s discontinued operation occurring on September 30, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S11	ASU 2014-09 On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which created Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( Topic 606 ) and superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P69_S12	In addition, ASU 2014-09 superseded the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts, and created new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P71_S6	The Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	ASU 2014-15 On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ), Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared with the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Currently, GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P74_S2	ASU 2014-15 provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P74_S3	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early application permitted for unissued financial statements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P74_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	On August 9, 2013, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain current liabilities of Syndicated.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	The acquired assets include executed end user customer agreements together with associated solar energy systems in various stages of completion along with software systems used by Syndicated to acquire new customers.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P75_S2	The Company acquired, at fair value, tangible net assets totaling negative $0.7 million and $1.9 million of goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P75_S3	The purchase consideration transferred, as amended on May 12, 2014, was comprised of cash of $0.3 million and 325,140 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, with an aggregate fair value of $0.7 million based on the closing price of the Company s Class A common stock on August 9, 2013.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P75_S4	The goodwill associated with this acquisition s commercial operations was impaired on June 30, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	The table below summarizes the determination of fair value of the purchase consideration in the acquired business as of the acquisition date (in thousands):
1425565_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The table below summarizes the assessment of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands).
1425565_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company obtained a third-party valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company assumed $2.2 million in accounts payable on the date of acquisition, including $1.6 million owed to a single vendor.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company paid $1.0 million to the vendor and recorded an accrued liability in the amount of $0.6 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	The vendor s terms require six monthly payments of $0.1 million through February 2014, and were paid in full.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	Under the terms of the original purchase agreement, Syndicated also had the potential to earn up to $250,000 in additional earn-out payments following the close of the 2013 fiscal year and an additional 1.3 million shares of unregistered Class A common stock in performance based earn-outs over the period August 9, 2013 to December 31, 2015.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P79_S4	On May 12, 2014, the parties amended the terms of the purchase agreement to eliminate any potential earn out payments and the Company issued 74,860 Class A common stock shares and recorded approximately $0.1 million of additional compensation expense during 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company includes results from operations of acquired companies in its consolidated financial statements from their respective effective acquisition dates.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	Pro forma financial information is not presented as the acquisition is not material to the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	The revenue and earnings of the acquired business were not material to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Mercury On January 14, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of Mercury through a merger.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was comprised of approximately 7.6 million shares of the Company s Class A common stock with an estimated fair value of $29.1 million based on the closing price of $3.83 per share for the Company s Class A common stock on January 13, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was subject to a working capital true-up adjustment based on the determined final closing balances and other revisions.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	Excluded from the provisional purchase consideration transferred is estimated acquisition-related costs to date of $2.8 million, which was reported in loss from discontinued operations in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as follows: $1.6 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	The table below summarizes the determination of fair value of the purchase consideration in the acquired business as of the acquisition date (in thousands): The Company believed that the acquisition of Mercury would provide strategic and financial benefits to the Company by positioning RGS as one of the largest U.S. solar installation companies (when measured by number of installed customers); increasing the Company s financial stability, access to capital, and purchasing power with suppliers; expanding the Company s existing brand presence in the Northeastern market of the United States; and realizing potential cost savings through centralization of certain functions and the reduction of redundant costs.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S5	These qualitative factors led to the initial recognition of acquired goodwill, which is not amortizable or otherwise deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P81_S6	As of June 30, 2014, the Company concluded these qualitative factors had not been and would not be realized.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The acquisition of Mercury was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	The amounts in the table below represent the preliminary allocation of the provisional purchase consideration transferred and are allocated to Mercury s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value as of January 14, 2014; which was subsequently adjusted based on a third-party valuation study.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	Additionally, under ASC Topic 805, we adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as we finalized valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P82_S3	Changes to separately identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities resulted in corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Sunetric On May 14, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sunetric, pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ( MIPA ) entered into on March 26, 2014 and amended on May 14, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The provisional purchase consideration transferred totaled $11.6 million and consisted of (i) approximately 4.0 million unregistered shares of the Company s Class A common stock with an estimated fair value of $11.1 million based on the closing price of $2.75 per share for the Company s Class A common stock on May 13, 2014 and (ii) $0.5 million of estimated probable contingent consideration.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	The provisional purchase consideration transferred is subject to a working capital true-up adjustment based on the determined final closing balances which may influence future releases of the holdback consideration of $1.82 million, or 604,711 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S3	An adjustment of approximately $0.45 million to the working capital was determined 90 days after close, such amount is a reduction of the 50% November, 2014 release of 302,355 million holdback shares.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S4	Accordingly, 150,154 holdback shares were held for release as of November 14, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S5	Therefore, a reduction of $0.4 million in contingent consideration was recorded as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S6	Additional contingent consideration gives the sellers the potential to earn up to $3.0 million in additional earn-out payments, to be paid in unregistered shares of the Company s Class A common stock, upon the achievement of certain revenue and income earn-out targets for 2014 and 2015.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S7	As of December 31, 2014, the sellers did not earn any of the 2014 earn-out consideration, reducing any future earn-out potential to $1 million consideration.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S8	Based on the 2015 budget, the Company believes the 2015 earn-out will be forfeited as well.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P83_S9	This determination resulted in the reduction of $0.5 million from the consideration to be transferred and is offset against the goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Sunetric is one of the largest and most experienced solar developers and integrators in Hawaii.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	As a full-service solar energy firm, they handle every stage of the design, development and installation of photovoltaic systems.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	The acquisition provides the Company with an immediate entry into a major market that has the highest electricity rates in the U.S. three times higher than the national average.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	These high rates provide compelling economics for homeowners and businesses to adopt solar photovoltaic systems.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	These qualitative factors led to the recognition of acquired goodwill, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Recently, the principal electric utility in Hawaii, the market Sunetric operates within, has taken further measures that the Company believes diminishes the value proposition of solar for both residential and commercial customers.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Those actions, along with a recent precipitous decline in sales for the Sunetric segment, caused management to conduct a review of the intangible assets recorded for Sunetric in conjunction with its preparation of its financial statements as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The electric regulatory environment along with the recent decline in sales has caused the Company s expectations for future growth and profitability to be lower than its previous estimates.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	As a result of its year-end 2014 impairment review, the Company recorded a write down of its intangible assets related to Sunetric of approximately $10.4 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The impairment reflects $8.0 million of goodwill, $1.1 million of trademarks and $1.3 million of purchased backlog and non-compete agreements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The acquisition of Sunetric has been accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The amounts in the table below represent the allocation of the provisional purchase consideration transferred and are allocated to Sunetric s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value as of May 14, 2014; which was subsequently adjusted based on a third-party valuation study.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P87_S2	Additionally, under ASC Topic 805, the Company adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as the valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were finalized.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P87_S3	Changes to separately identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities resulted in corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The estimated acquired intangibles, based on preliminary third-party valuation studies, are comprised of a customer-related intangible, production backlog, of $3.26 million, and marketing-related intangibles, such as trademarks of $1.24 million and a non-compete agreement of $0.13 million, the fair values of which were preliminarily estimated using traditional discounted future cash flow models.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The preliminary estimated useful lives assigned to these intangibles are as follows: production backlog 12 months; trademarks 120 months; and non-compete agreement 24 months.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	The production backlog and non-compete agreement intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis and the trademarks are amortized as their benefits are realized based on discounted future cash flow analyses.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	The Company has included Sunetric s financial results in its condensed consolidated financial statements from May 14, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P88_S4	Consequentially, $12.7 million of net revenue and $12.8 million of net losses which includes a noncash impairment charge of $10.4 million attributable to Sunetric are included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	Pro forma net losses reflect, among other adjustments, the following significant adjustments:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	All pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and upon assumptions that we believe are reasonable in order to reflect, on a supplemental pro forma basis, the impact of these acquisitions on our historical financial information.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s accounting standards codification, the Company established a purchase price for tangible assets net of liabilities for its catalog segment consisting primarily of its Hopland, California facility of $1 million based on (i) realizability of its personal assets and (ii) real property market place comparability (level two of the fair value hierarchy) during the third quarter of 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	Accordingly, as of September 30, 2014, the Company recognized a valuation impairment charge of $1.3 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P91_S2	Thereafter, on December 4, 2014, the Company executed a sale of Hopland assets, net of liabilities, for $1.0 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P91_S3	An additional loss on sale was recorded on the date of sale of $0.1 million and is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement operations.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company performed periodic tests of goodwill and other intangibles for its acquisitions of Syndicated, Mercury, and Sunetric.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company s goodwill balances were $1.3 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and other intangibles balances were zero and $0.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	Based on the results of these tests the Company determined it was appropriate and recorded impairment of goodwill and intangibles of $30.5 million, zero, and $22.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P94_S4	The Term Loan portion of the facility matured on September 29, 2014, at which time the Company repaid the then outstanding balance of $2.0 million in full plus a final fee of $150,000.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Borrowings bear interest at the greater of (a) the bank s prime rate plus 4.00%, or (b) 8.00%.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit of $4.4 million at December 31, 2014.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	These services included, but were not limited to, administrative, technical accounting advisory, public financial reporting and certain occupancy and related office services as required from time to time.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	Previously, the Company determined that it was not cost effective to obtain and separately maintain the personnel and infrastructure associated with these services with a complement of full time, skilled employees.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P111_S4	Such provisions required the exercise price of the warrants to be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants to increase, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants after taking into account the Black Scholes and fair market values of the warrants and such anti-dilution protection provisions.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P111_S5	Then, related to the July 9, 2014 warrant issuance, the previously adjusted exercise price was adjusted again to $2.45 and the number of warrants issued was increased by another 31,859 as a result of the anti-dilution provision.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P113_S8	On July 9, 2014 RGS issued 2.9 million shares of its Class A common stock and received proceeds of $7.0 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P113_S9	As part of the offering, RGS issued warrants to purchase 5.3 million shares of its Class A common stock at $3.19 per share, which expire July 9, 2020.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P113_S10	At December 31, 2014, RGS had the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	Each holder of the Company s Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted all of its holdings of the Company s Class B common stock to Class A common stock and, as a result, RGS has had no shares of Class B common stock outstanding since December 31, 2011.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	Under the terms of the Company s articles of incorporation and merger with Alteris, RGS is prohibited from issuing Class B common stock in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	All holders of Class A common stock vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	Accordingly, Riverside, as the holder of approximately 15% of the Class A common stock and entitled to vote in any election of directors, may exert significant influence over the election of the directors.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	Holders of the Company s Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Real Goods Solar, Class A common stock holders are entitled to share ratably in the Company s assets remaining after the payment of all debts and other liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	Holders of Class A common stock have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company s Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P118_S2	FASB ASC No. 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures- Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 820-10-35 ), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P118_S3	ASC 820-10-35-3 also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P118_S4	Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	ASC 820-10-35 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
1425565_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	The statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P119_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels: Level 1 Inputs Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	An active market is a market in which transactions occur for the item to be fair valued with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	Level 2 Inputs Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	Level 2 inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S2	These inputs include: (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, such as when there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially over time or in which little information is released publicly; (c) Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and (d) Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S3	Level 3 Inputs Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S4	These inputs should be used to determine fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P121_S5	Unobservable inputs should be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include internally generated data and assumptions being used to price the asset or liability.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P122_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value: For the Company s Level 3 measures, which represent common stock warrants, fair value is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model that is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions (See Note 2.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company used a market approach to valuing these derivative liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning to the ending balance for the Company s common stock warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (i.e. Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2014:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	Share-Based Compensation The Company s share-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	RGS primarily grants options under its 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but also granted 300,000 non-shareholder approved options to its chief executive officer during 2012 of which 210,000 were forfeited in 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	On January 14, 2014, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P127_S1	The amendment increased the number of options available for grant to 6,704,237.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company s 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 6,704,231 shares of its Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P128_S2	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, service providers and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	Options vest based on service conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in RGS industry and its stock price volatility since our initial public offering.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	RGS does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	RGS is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	RGS primarily uses plan life to-date forfeiture experience rate to estimate option forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The following are the variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under the Company s incentive plans for each of the years presented: The table below presents a summary of our option activity as of December 31, 2014 and changes during the year then ended:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $2.26, $1.13 and $0.76, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P136_S1	The total fair value of shares vested was approximately $900,000, $305,000 and $432,000 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P136_S2	The Company s share-based compensation cost charged against income for continuing operations was approximately $1.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.3 million during the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P136_S3	As of December 31, 2014, there was $0.9 million of unrecognized cost related to non-vested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P136_S4	The Company expects that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	Income Taxes The Company s provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P139_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets shown on a gross basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	At December 31, 2014, RGS had $90.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring, if not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	Additionally, the Company had $77.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring, it not utilized, beginning in 2019.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P140_S2	Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to annual limitation under applicable federal and state ownership change limitations and, accordingly, net operating losses may expire before utilization.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P140_S3	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis through December 2014 and therefore has not determined the impact of any ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred in prior years.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P140_S4	Therefore, the net operating loss carryforwards above do not reflect any possible limitations and potential loss attributes to such ownership changes.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized benefits will increase or decrease within 12 months of the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	As a result of the net operating losses, substantially all of its federal, state and local income tax returns are subject to audit.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S2	The Company s valuation allowance increased by approximately $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of its operating loss for the year.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S3	The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S4	Based upon the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S5	At December 31, 2014, the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected taxable income from the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S6	The Company is required, under the terms of its tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, to distribute to Gaiam the tax effect of certain tax loss carryforwards as utilized by the Company in preparing its federal, state and local income tax returns.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P141_S7	At December 31, 2014, utilizing an income tax rate of 35%, the Company estimates that the maximum amount of such distributions to Gaiam could aggregate $1.6 million.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	Segment Information On September 30, 2014, the Company discontinued its entire former Commercial segment.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	As a result of this major strategic shift, the Company now operates as three reportable segments: (1) Residential the installation of solar systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and for small businesses (small commercial) in the continental U.S.; (2) Sunetric the installation of solar systems for both homeowners and small business owners (small commercial) in Hawaii; and (3) Other corporate operations and retail (catalogue); however, see Note 4 for subsequent sale of the catalogue segment in December 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P142_S2	Financial information for the Company s segments and a reconciliation of the total of the reportable segments income (loss) from operations (measures of profit or loss) to the Company s consolidated net loss are as follows:
1425565_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following is a reconciliation of reportable segments assets to the Company s consolidated total assets.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P143_S1	The Other segment includes certain unallocated corporate amounts.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	Discontinued Operations On September 30, 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain net assets and rights comprising its large commercial installations business, otherwise known as its former Commercial segment, and focus its efforts and resources of its Residential and Sunetric segments.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P144_S1	This represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P144_S2	The Company will continue with in-process large commercial installations, but will not accept any new contracts and will commence various other exit activities.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	The company entered into a contract to sell portions of its commercial pipeline for cash, with the consideration to be paid dependent upon the completion of the buyer s due diligence.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, operating results, and operating and investing activities cash flows for the former Commercial segment are presented as a discontinued operation separate from the Company s continuing operations, for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and footnotes, unless indicated otherwise.

1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S2	In addition, investors who, together with certain attribution parties, would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after the closing of the offering as a result of their purchase of units, received shares of Class A common stock in an amount up to such 9.99% cap and a Series E Warrant to purchase the balance of the shares of Class A common stock the investor would have received at closing but for the 9.99% cap.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S3	The Company received net proceeds of approximately $2.75 million at the closing, after deducting commissions to the placement agent and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company associated with the offering.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S4	In addition, the Company received approximately $800,000 of additional proceeds upon the exercise of Series B Warrants in connection with the closing of the offering.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S5	As of March 23, 2015, the company has realized $2.9 million from the Class B warrants solely by voluntary exercises by the Class B warrant holders WestPark Capital, Inc. acted as the placement agent for the offering (the placement agent ) and in connection with the closing of the offering, the Company paid the placement agent an aggregate cash fee equal to $245,000, reimbursed expenses of $40,000, and issued warrants to purchase 560,000 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S6	The Company sold the units, the shares of Commons Stock and the warrants issued as part of the units, and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued as part of the units pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-193718).
1425565_15_ITEM8_P156_S7	The Company has agreed to maintain an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our chief executive officer, who also serves as our acting principal financial officer, and our principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2014, they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	In connection with this evaluation, our management identified the following material weaknesses in our disclosure and procedures:
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	As described below, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting concerning financial reporting, close processes and control monitoring.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	As a result, we were unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K within the prescribed due date and instead filed it within the grace period afforded by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Due to a significant increase in our stock price, as of the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2014, the public float of our Class A common stock exceeded $75 million.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result, our company no longer qualifies as a smaller reporting company and is now an accelerated filer for the first time.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Accordingly, this is the first fiscal year for which an audit of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent registered public accounting firm is required, and this is the first year that the filing deadline for our Annual Report on Form 10-K has been shortened from 90 days to 75 days following the end of the fiscal year.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	We had not commenced documentation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting until the appointment of our new chief executive officer in the third quarter of 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S6	As a result of the constraints on our financial staff connected with the transition to accelerated filer status, we employed qualified third-party specialists to assist with this process.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S7	Additionally, we have had recent changes to our finance and accounting management team.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S8	On October 14, 2014, our chief financial officer submitted his resignation.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S9	We have not appointed a new chief financial officer and our chief executive officer is currently serving as the acting chief financial officer.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S10	Also on October 14, 2014, we appointed a new principal accounting officer.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S11	As a result, there was a period of transition between management and our financial staff.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S12	In addition to constraints caused by personnel turnover of the financial staff, other events and changes have further limited the ability of the financial staff to complete the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S13	For example, we are currently restructuring our business operations to achieve a turnaround in our business results, which requires the active involvement of our management and financial staff.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S14	Also, during 2014, our management and financial staff were actively involved with integrating three acquired companies and conducting due diligence on, and closing, the acquisition of two of the companies.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S15	Furthermore, towards the end of 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015, our management and financial staff has been engaged in negotiating and closing a financing transaction, and amending and extending the terms of our bank credit facility and related-party debt.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P1_S16	Each of the constraints on our management and financial staff inhibited the ability to complete testing of internal control over financial reporting and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 timely, thus causing us to file Form 12b-25 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 within the grace period afforded by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework In connection with this assessment, our management has identified several deficiencies that, in the aggregate, caused our management to determine that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting exist.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Control monitoring including a lack of written documentation of internal controls which did not allow for effective communication of employee responsibilities.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	We did not maintain a comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our management has determined that the identified material weaknesses did not result in any material adjustments to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and do not require any restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a material misstatement.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Management did not include in its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of its subsidiary Elemental Energy LLC, dba Sunetric, which is included in the consolidated balance sheet of Real Goods Solar, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of this subsidiary because we acquired the subsidiary in May 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, Sunectric s revenue represents approximately 18% of our revenue from continuing operations (and 11% of our revenue from continuing operations plus discontinued operations).
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	EKS H LLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Disclosure Controls and Procedures With the oversight of management, we have begun taking steps and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying cause of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	1) Implement enhanced system-based controls, as well as other compensating controls, over restricted access, automated controls and change management activities within our ERP and other information technology systems.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	4) Revise our procedures for testing of our internal control over financial reporting, including changing the start date for the process to earlier in the year.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Our management believes that these measures will address the issues described above.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S2	We can make no assurance that these plans will be sufficient to correct the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and on disclosure controls and procedures or that additional steps may not be necessary in the future.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Our management and the audit committee of our board of directors will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and on disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and will take further action as appropriate.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S4	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Since the appointment of our current chief executive officer in the third quarter of 2014, management began documentation and testing of internal controls which has led to enhancements in controls during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 related to review and approval of journal entries, account reconciliations as well as enhanced documentation standards.
1425565_15_ITEM9A_P8_S5	We will continue to improve our internal controls during 2015 to remedy the material weaknesses discussed above.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P0_S0	In connection with the 2015 Offering, we are obligated to seek, no later than 75 days after the closing of the 2015 Offering, shareholder approval of (i) an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance, and (ii) a reverse stock split to cause us to become compliant again with the Nasdaq maintenance and listing requirements.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P0_S1	We will not amend our articles of incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares in connection with the reverse stock split.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P0_S2	The reverse stock split, if approved and implemented, would reduce the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and, therefore, make available more shares of Class A common stock for future issuances.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P1_S0	On March 31, 2015, we entered into a Waiver and Amendment Agreement (the Amendment ) with the Required Holders (as defined in the relevant transaction documents) to amend (i) the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 23, 2015, between us and the investor party thereto (the Securities Purchase Agreement ), and (ii) each of the five series of warrants to purchase Class A common stock issued to the investors in connection with our 2015 Offering.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P1_S1	After shareholder approval and implementation of a reverse stock split at a ratio of at least one-for-five and subject to the terms and conditions set for the therein, the Amendment eliminates the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our Class A common stock and all conditions in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the warrants requiring an increase in authorized shares will be deemed satisfied.
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P1_S2	The Amendment also increases the minimum reserve of shares of our Class A common stock we must maintain for issuance upon exercise of the warrants issued in our 2015 Offering from 200,000,000 to 300,0000,000 (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction).
1425565_15_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Further, the Amendment provides that to the extent the registration statement currently covering the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of the warrants issued in our 2015 Offering does not, at any time, cover a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise in full of the warrants then outstanding, we must promptly amend or supplement the registration statement or, if necessary, file a new registration statement in order to register the excess shares.

1425565_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	RGS Energy and its subsidiaries ( RGS , we , us , or the Company ) provide solar energy systems to homeowners, and commercial building owners in the United States.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We believe that solar energy adoption is still in the early stages and will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	RGS and its predecessors have installed over 25,000 solar energy systems across the continental United States and Hawaii since 1978.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our customers by managing and executing the process with our teams.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We design and offer a suitable solar energy solution, then procure, permit, install, and interconnect the system to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	We provide a comprehensive workmanship warranty on each fully operational system.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	RGS was incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our goals are to (i) provide solar solutions that save residential and commercial customers money and (ii) operate our Company at a profit.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our strategies to achieve these goals are:
1425565_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Install systems in geographic areas that allow us to provide electricity savings to customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Currently we install in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii, and California.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	These states typically have higher utility rates, additional local incentives and rebates, high customer return on investment, and/or favorable utility and government policies.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Annually, we perform an expansion assessment of the remaining states updating utility rates, local incentives and rebates to determine customer receptivity of our product based on potential customer return on investment.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	During the past two years we have built a call center in our headquarters in Louisville, Colorado to conduct sales via the phone and internet.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	This allows us to cost-effectively reach potential customers and easily enter new markets.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	Call center personnel have access to engineering, operations, customer support and other services personnel in Louisville allowing them to quickly address any questions that arise during the sales process.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Many prospective customers request a face-to-face meeting, so we utilize field sales staff in locations where it is cost-effective to do so, particularly in the North Eastern United States and Hawaii.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Continue to drive growth through referrals networks.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We pay customers for referring additional customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We will continue to expand these programs through the call center, post install in-home parties, user-friendly software, and digital marketing.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Installation capacity needs to match sales demand around the country to install solar systems with the shortest cycle time possible.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our installations are performed by both in-house crews and our authorized integrator network.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Offer attractive financing options for customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We refer our customers to a variety of options for financing solar energy systems including home improvement loans, equipment leases and power purchase agreements.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	In 2014 we began offering our own lease financing so that we could develop a portfolio of these assets and reduce our financing costs.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	Although we have ceased this offering until additional capital is raised.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe our clients select us because:
1425565_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have been in the solar industry for over 35 years.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our customers can utilize cash, loan, and leasing/power purchase agreements.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We are located in states where utility costs are high or incentives for solar energy systems are available , therefore offering an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We offer turnkey solar energy systems, including design, engineering, financing, procurement, permitting, installing, grid interconnection, monitoring, and maintenance.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We install residential and commercial systems generally between 3 kilowatts ( kW ), and 1 megawatts ( MW ) in size, depending on the amount of electricity used by the customer and the size of their building.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	The average solar energy system is approximately 6 kW. We maintain a service department to manage and assist with service and repairs as well as provide operations and maintenance service contracts for larger projects.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	We design and build solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average electricity rates to size the solar system and engineer its interconnection to the grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S5	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar photovoltaic ( PV ) modules.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S6	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory, rate structures, budget, preferred financing method and aesthetic preferences.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S7	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates, benefits of net metering, and various other factors.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P17_S8	We assess this data using estimated solar production tools and analytical calculations which enable us to size and configure a cost-effective solar system for the customer.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	We prepare final construction plans to obtain a building permit, which is necessary for grid interconnection and state incentive rebate processing.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	We also provide customers with a return on investment analysis which reflect the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Once all necessary approvals from financing partners and utilities, and incentive, rebate and jurisdictional authorities have been received, our in-house construction teams or authorized integrators begin the installation by placing racking on the customer s roof (or by building a ground mount in certain situations), followed by installation of the PV modules, inverter(s) and the balance of systems components and safety equipment.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	We do not manufacture PV modules or inverters, but rather purchase these manufactured components for incorporation into our constructed solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	After the PV modules and inverter(s) are installed on the customer s home or business, we obtain a final inspection of the installation by the local building department, prepare and submit all rebate applications to the appropriate rebating jurisdiction, and, at the same time, apply to the local utility company to finalize interconnection of the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The most visible component of solar energy systems are the PV modules which transform the sunlight into direct electrical current ( DC ), which then travels to the inverter.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	The inverter converts the DC electricity into useable alternating current ( AC ) that matches the current of the household electrical service and the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	The electricity created can go onto the grid or be used by the customer to power household items such as lights and appliances.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The other major components are the metal racking which holds the solar modules in place on the roof or ground, the monitoring which tracks the solar production of the system, and balance of system which includes clamps and electrical parts.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S4	We do not manufacture any of the components.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P21_S5	We purchase all components from the manufacturer or their distributors.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We and our suppliers offer warranties of up to 10 years for parts and labor, including property damage arising from workmanship, excluding roof penetrations which are generally warrantied for a period of 5 years.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	All major components installed in a PV system array are covered under transferable manufacturers warranties, which generally range from 10 to 25 years.

1425565_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to clean, renewable energy.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations generally up to 15kW in size.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service and municipal services.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally up to 500kW in size.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	These customers do not include any large commercial customers included in discontinued operations.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our solar energy systems utilize PV modules and inverters purchased from several manufacturers and distributors.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	We purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	We believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil based alternatives.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The other source of competition comes from other solar providers such as, SolarCity Corporation, Vivint Solar Inc., NRG Home Solar, Sunrun Inc., Verengo, Inc., Sungevity, Inc., and many others.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	We prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	We expend resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any public works construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Our in-house personnel monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Some jurisdictions place limits on the size or number of solar energy systems that can be interconnected to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	This can limit our ability to sell and install solar energy systems in some markets.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The regulatory environment is constantly changing.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, production-based incentives, tax abatements and rebates.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Following the extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in December 2015, the Internal Revenue Code allows a United States taxpayer to claim a tax credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2019.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	This credit is scheduled to decline to 26% effective January 1, 2020, 22% in 2021, and then to 10% for commercial projects and 0% for residential projects in 2022.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Many U.S. states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Some states have established limits on net metering, imposed monthly or other fees on solar energy systems, or reduced the credit available for electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	For example, Hawaii, Nevada and Mississippi have recently announced net metering policies that establish wholesale rates, not retail rates, for crediting electricity produced by solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	This has adversely impacted the attractiveness of solar to residential customers in these markets.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	The California Public Utilities Commission recently issued a new ruling that maintains the net energy metering credit at full retail value, but adds new charges and requirements for customers installing a solar energy system.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S4	On the other hand, other states continue to expand their net metering programs.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P46_S5	New York, for example, has suspended its cap on solar photovoltaic systems covered by the state s net metering program.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Some states like Massachusetts offer Solar Renewable Energy Credits ( SRECs ) that provide cash payments based on the electricity produced by solar energy systems as an incentive for customers to invest in these systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	These programs are generally capped and must be reauthorized or extended when the cap is reached in order for the incentives to be continued.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources recently announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded, and we expect the total capacity for smaller systems to be reached within a few months.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our business, with the first quarter representing our slowest sales quarter of the year.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Additionally, the fourth quarter can be impacted by unfavorable weather, especially in the North East United States.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	As of March 18, 2016, we had approximately 176 full-time and 3 part-time employees.
1425565_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We require significant additional funds in order to meet our financial obligations for the ensuing 12-month period and to maintain and grow our current operations, and we may be unable to obtain such necessary funds.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our operations do not generate sufficient revenue to enable us to operate profitably or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our offering of units of promissory notes convertible into our Class A common stock and warrants in April 2016, the 2016 offering , are insufficient to meet our obligations, we could be required to sell additional equity securities or refinance our obligations and may be unable to do so.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In such circumstances, we will be required to seek liquidity from the sale of assets, material reductions in operating costs, and extended terms for our obligations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These actions would require the consent of our senior lender and the holder(s) of our convertible notes, and would adversely impact our future financial results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	There can be no assurance that we would be successful in seeking additional capital, selling assets and obtaining extended terms for our obligations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $156.2 million as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We need to increase our sales, installations and revenue in order to achieve our goal of initially operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have developed plans to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and require additional financial resources to implement these plans.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our current levels of sales, installations and revenue are insufficient for profitable operations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have developed plans to increase sales, installations and revenue and need additional financial resources to implement these plans.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we are unsuccessful in executing these plans, or in raising additional capital to finance these plans, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, future financings or other sources to meet our debt service obligations, cash requirements to fund operations or other liquidity needs.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our failure to meet our debt service obligations or pay our indebtedness when it comes due may cause us to become insolvent, which would cast doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Existing rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In some states, net-metering is being replaced with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	For example, in October, 2015, the Hawaiian Electric Companies, the primary utility in Hawaii, announced that it was replacing its net metering program with a new grid supply program that credits excess electricity sent onto the grid by a solar energy system at a fixed rate of between 15 cents per kilowatt-hour and 27 cents per kilowatt hour, rather than at the higher retail rates available under the prior net-metering program and also imposes a minimum monthly bill of $25 dollars for owners of solar energy systems that remain connected to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Many jurisdictions also impose caps which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Some utilities also restrict the amount of consumer-owned electricity generation that can be placed on a circuit and the may require special studies or equipment before such generation can be connected to the utility grid.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems, deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	U.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	For example, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources recently announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded, and we expect the total capacity for smaller systems to be reached within a few months.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Massachusetts accounted for a significant amount of our sales in 2015, and if a new SREC program is not approved our sales in Massachusetts are likely to decline significantly.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	For projects where we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis or payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	For projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis our revenue from these installations is determined by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Although we generally have payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We experience spikes in orders in the spring and summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the summer and fall.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and the tax appetite of customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our ability to construct systems outdoors can be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and cash flow.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that cease to be attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, California and Hawaii.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may incur fines and other penalties if we do not conduct our business in accordance with licenses required for our operations and if any such license is suspended or lost, we may be unable to sell or install solar installation systems in the jurisdiction in question and our sales and revenue from that jurisdiction would be adversely affected.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As a construction company we are required to hold general or specialty contractors licenses in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, although in other jurisdiction we utilize the licenses of subcontractors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Some jurisdictions also require licenses to sell home improvement products or services, or to issue consumer credit.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we violate the rules of these licensing authorities we may incur fines or other penalties or have our licenses suspended or cancelled.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Some licenses require personnel with specific qualifications.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If we lose those personnel, we may lose our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction until we can hire a qualified replacement.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The qualifying employee for our Hawaii contractor s license recently resigned as our qualifying employee.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If we do not hire a new qualifying employee within 90 days of the submission of his resignation to the Hawaii contractors licensing authority board, we will not be able to sign new contracts and may have to suspend construction activities or utilize subcontractors until we can hire a qualified replacement.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If we are unable to hire a qualified replacement, or cannot do so in a timely manner, our revenue from the Sunetric segment will be adversely affected.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s ongoing investigation into the PIPE offering has adversely affected our reputation, financial resources and operations and is expected to continue to have a negative impact on us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	On June 29, 2015, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requesting the production of documents, records and information related to an investigation into our July 2014 private placement (the PIPE offering ).
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As a result of the investigation, we have incurred significant legal expenses.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred related expenses of approximately $2.0 million in connection with the investigation, which are shown on Consolidated Statements of Operations.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We and our legal advisors believe the expenses incurred in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena, which were incurred after June 30, 2015, should be fully paid by our insurance carrier as they are directly related to the July 2014 PIPE offering and we reached our retention limit for that event during the second quarter of 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Our insurance carrier has denied coverage for these expenses on the grounds that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena does not constitute a claim covered by the policy, but has nevertheless agreed to advance funds to pay amounts the Company contends constitute defense costs, while reserving all rights, including the right to recoup all amounts advanced.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We vigorously dispute the position of our insurance carrier in this matter.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	If our insurance carrier prevails in recouping the amounts advanced or ceases to advance funds for these expenses in a timely manner, it will further materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In addition to the direct investigation expense, the investigation distracts the time and attention of our officers and directors, diverts resources away from our operations and has damaged, and will continue to adversely impact, our reputation and relationships with shareholders, suppliers, customers and others.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers, installers and other vendors, to some of which we owe significant past due balances, and if these companies become unwilling to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	There have been times in our history when we have had significant outstanding balances and have been in arrears with many of our suppliers and vendors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	When these circumstances existed, many of these suppliers and vendors were no longer willing to provide products or services to us, and placed us on credit hold , or were requiring payment in advance.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	In January 2016 our largest distributor, Solar Solutions and Distribution, LLC, purchased our line of credit from Silicon Valley Bank in part so that they could obtain repayment of outstanding balances and obtain a security interest in our assets for the amounts owed to them.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted companies such as us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Shortages of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Manufacturers of PV modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in PV modules.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for PV modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	A significant percentage of PV modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2015 were sourced from North American manufacturers, we have experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	access to materials, labor and installation services.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Solar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and maintain insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Availability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Many of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price of our solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Third-party financing sources also charge significant fees for their financing products.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P73_S4	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In 2014 we introduced our own financing option in selective markets.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance most of our sales of solar energy systems.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses, could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We must meet The NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As previously disclosed, on December 23, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid-price rule.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We have 180 calendar days, or until June 20, 2016, to regain compliance.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we have not regained compliance by that date, and if certain conditions are met, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S4	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S5	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P85_S6	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We expect to hold a special meeting of our shareholders to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved we expect will cause our stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	There can be no assurance our shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The SEC rules and the NASDAQ Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The 2016 Offering will be dilutive for current shareholders.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In addition, as of March 18, 2016, there were an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock that may be issued upon exercise or conversion of other outstanding options to purchase our Class A common stock under our 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan and warrants or other agreements.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on the Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P100_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P100_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Riverside has influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Riverside holds 13.4% of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of March 18, 2016.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Riverside s ownership may decrease depending on the amount of shares of Class A common stock we issue in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the merger with Alteris Renewables, Inc. ( Alteris ), Riverside currently has the right to designate one individual for appointment or nomination to our board of directors.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Because of Riverside s voting rights and its ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, Riverside will be able to exert influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares authorized for issuance under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Possible future sales of shares by Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Riverside may sell any or all of the shares of Class A common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason.
1425565_16_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.
1425565_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in Louisville, Colorado.
1425565_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities:
1425565_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 1 month to 3 years.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	On July 9, 2014, the Company completed a private offering of approximately $7.0 million of its Class A common stock and warrants to purchase Class A common stock at a price per share unit of $48.00 ($2.40 pre-reverse split) (the July 2014 PIPE Offering ).
1425565_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	Subsequently, the Company s stock price declined to $0.63 as of December 31, 2015 and five of the investors that participated in the offering (out of approximately 20 total investors that participated in the offering) asserted claims against the Company alleging certain misrepresentations and omissions in the offering.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	We subsequently reached settlements with all five investors.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Company recorded a charge to operations of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2015, in recognition of the loss contingency for the July 2014 PIPE Offering.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	That charge was equal to the retention under the Company s 2014-15 Officers and Directors liability insurance policy as the Company expects the insurance policy will cover any future claims in excess of the retention limit.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On June 29, 2015, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requesting the production of documents, records and information related to an investigation into the Company s July 2014 PIPE offering.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company believes that it has complied fully with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and has been cooperating fully with the government s investigation.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Company has established a special committee of the board of directors to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the PIPE offering and engaged outside counsel to assist it with its review.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	As a result, the Company has incurred litigation expenses of $2.0 million which are shown on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for year ended December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S4	The Company and its legal advisors believe its expenses in responding to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena, which were incurred after June 30, 2015, should be fully paid by its insurance carrier as they are directly related to the July 2014 PIPE Offering and the Company reached its retention limit for that event during the second quarter of 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S5	Our insurance carrier has denied coverage for these expenses on the grounds that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena does not constitute a claim covered by the policy, but has in March 2016 nevertheless agreed to advance funds to pay amounts we contend constitute defense costs, while reserving all rights, including the right to recoup all amounts advanced.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S6	We vigorously dispute the position of our insurance carrier in this matter.
1425565_16_ITEM3_P2_S7	If our insurance carrier prevails in recouping the amounts advanced or ceases to advance funds for these expenses in a timely manner, it will further materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	On March 18, 2016 we had approximately 89 shareholders of record and 12,561,943 shares of $.0001 par value Class A common stock and no shares of $.0001 par value Class B shares outstanding.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low close prices for our Class A common stock for the periods indicated:
1425565_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	Our revolving line of credit with Solar Solutions Distribution, LLC. prohibits the payment of dividends.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	All sales of unregistered equity securities during 2015 have been previously reported in a Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.
1425565_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table summarizes equity compensation plan information for our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2015:
1425565_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	During 2014, we committed to a plan to sell certain contracts and rights comprising our large commercial installations business, otherwise known as our former Commercial segment.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	At the same time, we determined not to enter into further large commercial installation contracts in the mainland United States.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Most contracts in process at December 31, 2014 were substantially completed during 2015 and we expect any remaining work to be completed in 2016.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	We now report this business as a discontinued operation, separate from our continuing operations.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	The following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is for our continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a residential and small commercial solar energy engineering, procurement and construction firm.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We also perform most of our own sales and marketing activities to generate leads and secure projects.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	We offer turnkey services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our solar energy systems use high-quality solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We use proven technologies and techniques to help customers achieve meaningful savings by reducing their utility costs.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, we help customers lower their emissions output and reliance upon fossil fuel energy sources.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We, including our predecessors, have more than 35 years of experience in residential solar energy and trace our roots to 1978, when Real Goods Trading Corporation sold the first solar photovoltaic panels in the United States.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have designed and installed over 25,000 residential and commercial solar systems since our founding.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	During 2014, we discontinued our entire former Commercial segment and sold the assets associated with our catalog segment (a portion of the Other segment).
1425565_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	As a result of this major strategic shift, we now operate as three reportable segments: (1) Residential the installation of solar energy systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and for small businesses (small commercial) in the continental U.S.; (2) Sunetric the installation of solar energy systems for both homeowners and business owners (commercial) in Hawaii; and (3) Other catalog, for 2014, and corporate operations.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe this new structure will enable us to more effectively manage our operations and resources.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of Mercury Energy, Inc. on January 14, 2014 through a merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The total consideration transferred was approximately $29.1 million and was comprised of 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock, based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $76.60 per share on January 13, 2014, subject to an escrow arrangement and adjusted for a post-closing working capital adjustment.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of Elemental Energy LLC, d/b/a, Sunetric, on May 14, 2014 pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The total consideration transferred was approximately $9.4 million and was comprised of 0.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, based on our Class A common stock closing market price of $55.00 per share on May 13, 2014, adjusted for a post-closing working capital adjustment; and $0.5 million of estimated probable contingent consideration.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was subject to a working capital true-up adjustment based on the determined final closing balances.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	The contingent consideration provided the sellers with the potential to earn up to $3.0 million in additional earn-out payments, to be paid in unregistered shares of our Class A common stock, upon the achievement of certain revenue and income earn-out targets for 2014 and 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	The majority of these targets were not achieved and the contingent consideration has been adjusted accordingly.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kW, residential and small commercial customers , we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Components are principally comprised of photovoltaic panels, inverters, and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	For those systems of 100 kW or greater, commercial customers, we recognize revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We invoice commercial customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as PV modules and inverters) located at our warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We warrant solar energy systems sold to customers for ten years against defects in material or installation workmanship.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	We generally provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	We assess the accrued warranty reserve regularly and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting unit against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We account for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The cost of an acquisition, including any contingent consideration, is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The excess of the cost of the acquisition over our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Further, acquisition tax benefits we obtain from acquired companies are recognized in operating income as changes in our tax valuation allowance for our previously existing deferred tax assets.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	We engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, property and equipment and any other significant assets or liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period (up to one year) as we finalize the initial valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	We recognize compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition for performance based awards or over a service period for time based awards.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 12.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carry-forward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We measure the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to our subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net revenue decreased $25.2 million, or 35.7%, to $45.5 million during 2015, from $70.8 million during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decrease in revenue reflects a decrease in solar systems constructed to 9.7 MW in 2015 from 17.0 MW in 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Net revenue for our residential segment decreased $25.6 million, or 45.9%, to $30.2 million during 2015, from $55.8 million during 2014, primarily due to our closing of California and Missouri offices.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Net revenue for our Sunetric segment increased by $2.6 million, or 20.3% to $15.3 million during 2015, from $12.7 million during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	This represents the installment of 3.8 megawatts in 2015 in comparison to 2.7 megawatts in 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gross profit decreased $6.3 million, or 49.6%, to $6.4 million during 2015, from $12.8 million during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Gross profit percentage decreased to 14.1% during 2015 from 18.0% during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	The decrease in the residential segment s gross profit percentage was due to the proportionate greater absorption of fixed costs associated with the decline in revenue from the prior year.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Selling and operating expenses decreased $13.5 million, or 49.2%, to $13.9 million during 2015 from $27.4 million during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The decrease in selling and operating expenses is attributable to taking actions to reduce operating expenses in proportion to declining revenue including: (i) a decrease in indirect payroll and burden of approximately $5.9 million, (ii) decreased marketing expenditures of $2.8 million and (iii) decreased commissions of $2.2 million due to a change in commission structure.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased, consistent with the approach for selling and operating expenses to reduce expenses in proportion to the declines in revenue, approximately $2.4 million, or 29.8%, to $5.8 million during 2015, from $8.3 million during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease in general and administrative expense is mainly attributable to: (i) a decrease in indirect payroll and burden of approximately $1.4 million, and (ii) decreases in occupancy and office related expenses.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 13.4% during 2015 from 12.0% during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	There were no acquisition costs during 2015 as compared to $0.8 million in 2014 related to the acquisition of Sunetric.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Restructuring costs were approximately $0.2 million during 2015 for costs incurred by management s decision to seek cost efficiencies and severance paid to departing executives.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	During 2014 there were approximately $0.6 million of restructuring costs.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Litigation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 consist of $2.0 million associated with the legal costs of responding to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena and settlements with investors in our July 2014 PIPE Offering, as more fully described in Note 8.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Goodwill and other asset impairments .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Goodwill and other asset impairments were $0.0 million during 2015, compared to $11.8 million in 2014 which consisted of $10.4 million of goodwill related to Sunetric and approximately $1.3 million of real property and inventories related to the catalog segment.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other income increased $0.3 million to $0.4 million during 2015 from $0.1 million during 2014 due primarily to the gain on sale of fully depreciated assets.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest expense decreased approximately $0.7 million to $0.5 million during 2015 from $1.2 million during 2014 due converting related party debt to equity in the second quarter of 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Change in valuation of warrants .
1425565_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We recorded noncash gains of $7.1 million during 2015 and $14.2 million during 2014 primarily due to decreasing stock prices resulting in adjustments to the fair value of the common stock warrant liability.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Income tax benefit was approximately $0.0 million for 2015, compared to $1.2 million in 2014 which was primarily by tax benefits realized from the acquisition of Sunetric.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	As a result of the above factors, our net loss from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.8 million, or $(1.20) per share, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $26.2 million, or $(10.95) per share, during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our net loss from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million, or $(0.12) per share, as compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $30.9 million, or $(12.92) per share, during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	As a result of the above factors, our net loss was $10.8 million, or $(1.32) per share, during 2015 compared to $57.1 million, or $(23.87) per share, during 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our trend in cash flow for the prior two years is as follows:
1425565_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our recurring negative cash flow from operations:
1425565_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Has been funded by raising new capital.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Arose from increases in litigation, selling and operating expenses as well as increases in general and administrative expenses relating investment in sales and marketing to grow revenue.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result of these losses:
1425565_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	We were in technical default of certain covenants contained in our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) both as of September 30, 2015 and as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	As discussed in Note 6, we obtained a modification and waiver of the technical default.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	In December, 2015 we entered into a letter of intent with Solar Solutions and Distribution, LLC ( Solar Solutions ) in which Solar Solutions agreed to purchase this credit facility from SVB and revise the terms of this facility.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Subsequent Events, Solar Solutions completed the purchase of the loan facility on January 19, 2016 and we entered into a loan waiver and modification agreement with Solar Solutions bringing us into compliance with the revised terms of the loan facility.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from our equipment suppliers.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We implemented measures to reduce our cash outflow from operations from the prior year.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for our products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have prepared our business plan for 2016, taking into account (i) the proceeds from offerings described below, (ii) the availability under our primary lending facility with Solar Solutions, (iii) anticipated timing of vendor payments for existing accounts payable and for new solar panels, (iv) anticipated timing of sales and installations of solar energy systems, (v) anticipated timing of collection of accounts receivable, and (vi) our operating cost structure following the implementation of cost improvement actions.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our objectives in preparing this plan included (i) making necessary reductions, that have already been enacted, to our fixed operating cost infrastructure in order to reduce the required level of future revenue for profitable operations (ii) improving our gross margin by having a lower of cost of equipment arising from more favorable vendor terms and costs of materials, which have already been negotiated, and (iii) an anticipated reduction in our present operating losses and with the intention of returning to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) moving towards an optimized field and e-sales force, (iv) optimizing our construction capability for solar energy system installations through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of the backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, and (vi) continued internal efforts to convert our accounts receivable to cash more quickly.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We expect that we will have a cash outflow from operating activities for the ensuing year as we will utilize cash to fund an anticipated increased level of rooftop installations for customers, thereby generating revenue, expand our e-sales and field sales organizations as well as increased marketing spend for lead generation, and also to continue to reduce our present accounts payable.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	We believe that as a result of (i) additional capital of $9.25 million, of which we anticipates the release of at least one-half from restricted cash during the ensuing 12-month period (ii) replacing SVB with Solar Solutions for our credit facility on improved terms for the ensuing 12 months, and (iii) the actions we have already implemented to reduce our fixed operating cost infrastructure, we have sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	In the event that as a result of presently unforeseen circumstances our plan would not be sufficient to operate, we would enact further cost reductions and or raise additional capital.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	On December 23, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid-price of $1 per share.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	We have 180 calendar days, or until June 20, 2016, to regain compliance.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	If we have not regained compliance by that date, and if certain conditions are met, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	We expect to hold a special meeting of our shareholders to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved we expect will cause our stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	There can be no assurance our shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	On February 26 and February 27, 2015, we closed an offering of units (the February 2015 Offering ).
1425565_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Each unit consisted of: (i) one share of Class A common stock; (ii) a Series A warrant to purchase share of Class A common stock equal to 50% of the sum of the number of shares of Class A common stock purchased as part of the units plus, if applicable, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise in full of the Series E warrants (without regard to any limitations on exercise) described below; (iii) a Series B warrant to purchase shares of Class A common stock for a stated amount (as described in the offering document); (iv) a Series C warrant to purchase up to 50% of that number of shares of Class A common stock actually issued upon exercise of the Series B warrant; and (v) a Series D warrant to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in an amount determined on a future reset date after the issuance of the Series D warrant.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	In addition, in the event that an investor would beneficially own in excel of 4.99% of the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately before the offering, such investor would receive a Series E warrant to purchase the balance of the shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	As more fully described under the heading Series A and Series C Warrant Exchange for Common Stock in Note 9.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Shareholders Equity, during the second quarter, we exchanged shares of Class A common stock for Series A and Series C warrants.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we realized net proceeds of $10.6 million from the February 2015 Offering.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	On June 30, 2015, we closed an offering of $5 million of units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one Series F warrant to purchase 30% of one share of Class A common stock (the June 2015 Offering ).
1425565_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	We sold the units at an initial purchase price of $3.65 per unit with a one-time reset adjustment of (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock, and (ii) the exercise price of the Series F warrants to purchase Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	On July 9, 2015, as a result of the reset adjustment, the purchase price of Class A common stock in the June 2015 Offering was reset at $1.2432 per share and the exercise price of the Warrants was adjusted to $1.2432 per share and an additional 2,652,020 shares of Class A common stock were delivered to June 2015 Offering investors from the escrow established with our transfer agent.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	On June 24, 2015, we entered into a Conversion Agreement (the Conversion Agreement ) with Riverside Fund III, L.P. (the Riverside Lender ), an entity affiliated with Riverside, to convert notes payable with a principal balance of $3.15 million plus accrued interest of approximately $1.1 million into 1,288,156 shares of Class A common stock (the Riverside Shares using a conversion ratio equal to $3.29 per share; the closing price of the Class A common stock on June 23, 2015 (the Conversion ).

1425565_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Riverside is currently our largest shareholder and holds approximately 13.7% of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	On April 1, 2016, we completed a private placement (the "2016 Offering") of $10.0 million in principal amount of Senior Secured Convertible Notes due on April 1, 2019 (the "Notes") with unaffiliated institutional investors.

1425565_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	We received $0.75 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes at closing of the 2016 Offering in unrestricted cash.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	The remaining $9.25 million of the proceeds is held in five separate collateral accounts each subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement between the Bank of Hawaii, the Company, and the applicable investor.

1425565_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Notes are convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of Class A common stock at the lower of a fixed and floating conversion price.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The initial fixed conversion price is $0.8033 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, and the like.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	The floating conversion price is equal to the lowest of (i) 85% of the arithmetic average of the five lowest volume-weighted average prices of the Class A common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes, (ii) 85% of the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes, and (iii) 85% of the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock on the trading day of the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	In no event may the conversion price be less than $0.25 per share.
1425565_16_ITEM7_P72_S4	If the conversion price to be used for calculating the shares of Common Stock issuable would have been less than $0.25 per share but for such limitation, the Company is obligated to issue shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.25 and pay cash to the Note holders in an amount calculated pursuant to formulas set forth in the Notes.

1425565_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	During 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain contracts and rights comprising its large commercial installations business, otherwise known as its former Commercial segment.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	At the same time, the Company determined not to enter into further large commercial installation contracts in the mainland United States.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	The Company expects that contracts in process at December 31, 2015 will be mostly complete during 2016 with minimal activity in the subsequent year.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	This business is reported as a discontinued operation, separate from continuing operations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	The following footnotes are for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and available borrowings aggregating $0.6 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	As a result of these losses:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company was in technical default of certain covenants contained in its credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB") both as of December 31, 2015 and as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Revolving Line of Credit, Solar Solutions and Distribution, LLC, a Colorado-based renewable energy solutions company ("Solar Solutions") acquired SVB's loan to the Company on January 19, 2016 and obtained a waiver of the technical defaults at that time.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	On that date the loan was further modified providing the Company with improved terms, such as an expanded definition of the loan's borrowing base.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from its equipment suppliers.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company, starting with the fourth quarter of 2014, implemented measures to reduce its cash outflow from operations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for its products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	Although the Company was successful in reducing its cash used in operations (both continuing and discontinued operations), technical defaults with SVB described above and limited vendor terms that limited the Company s ability to convert its backlog in an expeditious manner, resulted in customer cancellations of contracts.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P21_S3	As a result of these circumstances, the Company arranged for additional financial capital as discussed below.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	During 2015, the Company, in two capital raising transactions, raised net proceeds of $15.0 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Subsequent Events, on April 1, 2016 the Company issued $10.0 million of convertible notes raising net proceeds of $9.4 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company has prepared its business plan for 2016 and believes it has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12-month period from March 31, 2016.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company objectives in preparing this plan included (i) expanding the size of the Company s sales and construction organizations to generate gross margin that is in excess of its reduced fixed operating cost infrastructure and (ii) thereby reducing the Company s present operating losses and returning the Company to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, of which substantially all had been achieved by the end of 2015, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) hiring and training additional field and e-sales force personnel to grow sales, (iv) optimizing the Company s construction capability through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of the Company s backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, (vi) realizing the benefits of new vendor terms negotiated by the Company during the last half of 2015 that will reduce the cost of equipment acquired by the Company, (vii) increasing the sales and installations with small commercial customers, and (vi) continued internal efforts to accelerate the conversion of the Company s accounts receivable to cash.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company believes that as a result of (i) additional capital of $9.25 million, of which the Company anticipates the release of at least one-half of this from restricted cash during the ensuing 12-month period (ii) replacing SVB with Solar Solutions for its credit facility on improved terms for the ensuing 12 months, and (iii) the actions it has already implemented to reduce its fixed operating cost infrastructure, the Company has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	In the event that as a result of presently unforeseen circumstances the Company s plan would not be sufficient to operate, the Company would attempt to enact further cost reductions and or raise additional capital.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	On December 23, 2015, the Company received notice from NASDAQ that it was not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid-price of $1 per share.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company has180 calendar days, or until June 20, 2016, to regain compliance.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	If it has not regained compliance by that date, and if certain conditions are met, it may be eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company expects to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved the Company expects will cause its stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	There can be no assurance the Company s shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	No changes were made to the Company s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Significant estimates are used to value to warranty liability, fair value of outstanding warrants, and allowance for doubtful accounts (discussed below).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The reclassifications did not impact prior period results of operations, cash flows, total assets, total liabilities or total equity.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company makes estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.2 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at Company warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company identifies the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company writes down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through its current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	The Company has a reserve for obsolete or slow moving inventory of $0.3 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company states property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	RGS amortizes leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1425565_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The cost of an acquisition, including any contingent consideration, is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P36_S2	The excess of the cost of the acquisition over our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P36_S3	Further, acquisition tax benefits we obtain from acquired companies are recognized in operating income as changes in our tax valuation allowance for our previously existing deferred tax assets.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company engages outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, property and equipment and any other significant assets or liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company adjusts the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period (up to one year) as the initial valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), trademarks, and non-compete agreements are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P40_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about our future cash flows.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kilowatts (kW), residential and small commercial customers the Company recognizes revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Components comprise of photovoltaic panels and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	For those systems of 100kW or greater, commercial customers the Company recognizes revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company invoices large installation customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	Unbilled receivables were included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company measures compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 11.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P53_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company s effective tax rate remains fairly consistent.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	RGS has significant net operating loss carry-forwards and will re-evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether it expects it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable through the reversal of taxable temporary differences in future years as a result of normal business activities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company has agreed under our tax sharing agreement with Gaiam to make payments to Gaiam as RGS utilizes certain of its net operating losses in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	RGS measures the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The application of income tax law is inherently complex.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	As such, RGS is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to the Company s subjective assumptions and judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and general and administration expenses, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company warrants solar energy systems sold to customers for one year against defects in material or installation workmanship.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which is typically passed through to the customers, has a typical product warranty period of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Company assesses the accrued warranty regularly and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P59_S4	Accrued warranty is recorded as a component of accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was not significant as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	RGS computes net loss per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares of the Company s Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	Weighted average common share equivalents of 1,606,660 and 545,800 shares have been omitted from net loss per share for 2015 and 2014, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company did not have any customer who accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company has a potential concentration of supply risk in that during 2015 it purchased approximately 50% of the major components for its solar installations from three suppliers.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	During 2015 the Company did not have any customer representing over 10% of sales.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company s chief operating decision maker is the executive team.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate the resources and in assessing the performance of the Company, the Company has determined that it has three reporting segments: residential solar installations, retail and corporate operations ( other segment ), and Sunetric installations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company accounts for common stock warrants and put options in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 480, Liabilities Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, as either liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The common stock warrants are accounted for as a liability due to a provision which allows for the warrant holder to require redemption, at the intrinsic value of the warrant, upon a change of control.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	We classify these derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as a long term liability, which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	The Company uses a Monte Carlo pricing model to value these derivative liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Monte Carlo pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	In building the Monte Carlo pricing model, the Company assumed a 15% probability of a change in control and used 20 nodes (See Note 10.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in fair value of warrant liability, with an offsetting non-cash entry recorded as an adjustment to the warrant liability.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following table reflects original assumptions for common stock warrant liability issued in the first quarter of 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following table reflects assumptions for common stock warrants liability outstanding as of December 31, 2015:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The table below summarizes the Company s derivative warrant activity, adjusted to reflect the one-for-twenty reverse stock split on May 18, 2015 (in thousands except for per warrant data):
1425565_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	To reflect changes in the fair values of its outstanding warrants, the Company recorded its common stock warrant liability, net of noncash charges of $7.1 million decrease and $14.2 million decrease during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	In the event warrants are exercised or expire without being exercised, the fair value is reduced by the number of warrants exercised or expired multiplied by the fair value of each warrant at the time of exercise or expiration, with a credit to additional paid-in capital.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	To determine lease classification, the Company evaluates lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life, or whether the present value of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	All of the Company s leased systems are treated as sales-type leases under U.S. GAAP accounting policies.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Financing receivables are generated by solar energy systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	Financing receivables represents gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term of up to 20 years and the systems estimated residual value, net of allowance for estimated losses.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Initial direct costs for sales-type leases are recognized as cost of sales when the solar energy systems are placed in service.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	For systems classified as sales-type leases, the net present value of the minimum lease payments, net of executory costs, is recognized as revenue when the lease is placed in service.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	This net present value as well as the net present value of the residual value of the lease at termination are recorded as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	The difference between the initial net amounts and the gross amounts are amortized to revenue over the lease term using the interest method.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	The residual values of our solar energy systems are determined at the inception of the lease applying an estimated system fair value at the end of the lease term.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	RGS considers the credit risk profile for its lease customers to be homogeneous due to the criteria the Company uses to approve customers for its residential leasing program, which among other things, requires a minimum fair FICO credit quality.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	Accordingly, the Company does not regularly categorize its financing receivables by credit risk.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases, which requires lessees to record a lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	While the new guidance for lessors is largely unchanged, sales-type leases must apply a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at the earliest reported comparative period.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P82_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P82_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires the Company to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the ordinary selling price less any completion, transportation and disposal costs.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	For all other entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P85_S3	The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2015-03 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01 ( ASU 2015-01 ), Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	The standard eliminates the concept of extraordinary item.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, however early adoption is permitted.

1425565_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ), Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared with the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	Currently, GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	ASU 2014-15 provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early application permitted for unissued financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which created Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( Topic 606 ) and superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	In addition, ASU 2014-09 superseded the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts, and created new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	The effective date for the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are revised by ASU 2015-14.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	On January 14, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of Mercury Energy Inc. through a merger.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was comprised of approximately 0.4 million shares of the Company s Class A common stock with an estimated fair value of $29.1 million based on the closing price of $76.60 per share for the Company s Class A common stock on January 13, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was subject to a working capital true-up adjustment based on the determined final closing balances and other revisions.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	Excluded from the provisional purchase consideration transferred is estimated acquisition-related costs of $2.8 million, which was reported in loss from discontinued operations in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The table below summarizes the determination of fair value of the purchase consideration in the acquired business as of the acquisition date (in thousands):
1425565_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company believed that the acquisition of Mercury would provide strategic and financial benefits to the Company by positioning RGS as one of the largest U.S. solar installation companies (when measured by number of installed customers); increasing the Company s financial stability, access to capital, and purchasing power with suppliers; expanding the Company s existing brand presence in the Northeastern market of the United States; and realizing potential cost savings through centralization of certain functions and the reduction of redundant costs.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	These qualitative factors led to the initial recognition of acquired goodwill, which is not amortizable or otherwise deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	As of June 30, 2014, the Company concluded these qualitative factors had not been and would not be realized.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The acquisition of Mercury was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	The amounts in the table below represent the preliminary allocation of the provisional purchase consideration transferred and are allocated to Mercury s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value as of January 14, 2014; which was subsequently adjusted based on a third-party valuation study.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	Additionally, under ASC Topic 805, we adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as we finalized valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P99_S3	Changes to separately identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities resulted in corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	On May 14, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Elemental Energy LLC, dba, Sunetric, pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ( MIPA ) entered into on March 26, 2014 and amended on May 14, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The provisional purchase consideration transferred totaled $11.6 million and consisted of (i) approximately 0.2 million unregistered shares of the Company s Class A common stock with an estimated fair value of $11.1 million based on the closing price of $55.00 per share for the Company s Class A common stock on May 13, 2014, and (ii) $0.5 million of estimated probable contingent consideration.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	The Company held back $1.82 million of the provisional purchase consideration, or 30,235 shares of Class A common stock, to secure potential future indemnification claims.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S3	The hold back consideration, less an amount equal to any unresolved indemnification claims, were to be released to sellers 50% on each of the six-month and 12-month anniversaries after the closing.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S4	The provisional purchase consideration transferred was subject to a post-closing working capital true-up adjustment based on the determined final closing balances.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S5	90 days after the closing the parties determined that the actual closing working capital was $0.45 million lower than the estimated closing working capital.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P100_S6	As a result, the first 50% release of hold back consideration in November 2014 was reduced from 15,118 to 7,508 shares and we recorded a reduction of $0.4 million in contingent consideration as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Additional contingent consideration gave the sellers the potential to earn up to $3.0 million in additional earn-out payments, to be paid in unregistered shares of the Company s Class A common stock, upon the achievement of certain revenue and income earn-out targets for 2014 and 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the sellers did not earn any of the 2014 earn-out consideration, reducing any future earn-out potential to $1.0 million consideration.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	The 2015 earn-out was partially forfeited as well.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	This determination resulted in the reduction of $0.5 million from the consideration to be transferred and is offset against the goodwill in 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P101_S4	Shares were reserved for issuance for the contingent consideration due.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	Sunetric is one of the largest and most experienced solar developers and integrators in Hawaii.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	As a full-service solar energy firm, they handle every stage of the design, development and installation of photovoltaic systems.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	The acquisition provides the Company with an immediate entry into a major market that has the highest electricity rates in the U.S. three times higher than the national average.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P102_S3	These high rates provide compelling economics for homeowners and businesses to adopt solar photovoltaic systems.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P102_S4	These qualitative factors led to the recognition of acquired goodwill, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The principal electric utility in Hawaii, the market Sunetric operates within, has taken further measures that the Company believes diminishes the value proposition of solar for both residential and commercial customers.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	Those actions, along with the precipitous decline in sales for the Sunetric segment, caused management to conduct a review of the intangible assets recorded for Sunetric in conjunction with its preparation of its financial statements as of December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	The electric regulatory environment along with the recent decline in sales has caused the Company s expectations for future growth and profitability to be lower than its previous estimates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	As a result of its year-end 2014 impairment review, the Company recorded a write down of its intangible assets related to Sunetric of approximately $10.4 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	The impairment reflects $8.0 million of goodwill, $1.1 million of trademarks and $1.3 million of purchased backlog and non-compete agreements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The acquisition of Sunetric has been accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	The amounts in the table below represent the allocation of the provisional purchase consideration transferred and are allocated to Sunetric s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value as of May 14, 2014; which was subsequently adjusted based on a third-party valuation study.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	Additionally, under ASC Topic 805, the Company adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as the valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were finalized.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	Changes to separately identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities resulted in corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	The estimated acquired intangibles, based on preliminary third-party valuation studies, are comprised of a customer-related intangible, production backlog, of $3.26 million, and marketing-related intangibles, such as trademarks of $1.24 million and a non-compete agreement of $0.13 million, the fair values of which were preliminarily estimated using traditional discounted future cash flow models.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	The preliminary estimated useful lives assigned to these intangibles are as follows: production backlog 12 months; trademarks 120 months; and non-compete agreement 24 months.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P106_S2	The production backlog and non-compete agreement intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis and the trademarks are amortized as their benefits are realized based on discounted future cash flow analyses.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s accounting standards codification, the Company established a purchase price for tangible assets net of liabilities for its catalog segment consisting primarily of its Hopland, California facility of $1 million based on (i) realizability of its personal assets and (ii) real property market place comparability (level two of the fair value hierarchy) during the third quarter of 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	Accordingly, as of September 30, 2014, the Company recognized a valuation impairment charge of $1.3 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	Thereafter, on December 4, 2014, the Company sold the Hopland assets, net of liabilities, for $1.0 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P107_S3	An additional loss on sale was recorded on the date of sale of $0.1 million and is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement operations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company performed periodic tests of goodwill and other intangibles for its acquisitions of Syndicated Solar Inc., Mercury, and Sunetric.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	Based on the results of these tests the Company determined it was appropriate and recorded impairment of goodwill and intangibles of zero and $30.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P108_S2	The Company s goodwill balances were $1.3 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	Under a loan agreement, as amended (the Loan ), the Company has a revolving line of credit that provides for advances not to exceed a maximum amount based upon a borrowing base availability of 75% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory as defined in the Loan.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	The maximum amount of the Loan is currently $5.0 million, and is reduced to $4.0 million on October 1, 2016 and to $3.0 million on January 1, 2017.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	Borrowings bear interest at the greater of (a) the greater of the prime rate or 4.00%, plus 3.00%, and (b) 7.00%.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	The amended maturity date for the Loan is currently March 31, 2017.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The line of credit has a facility fee of 2.0% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had a line of credit outstanding with SVB under the Loan of $0.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, accruing interest at 8% per annum as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The 2015 amendments to the Loan and subsequent amendments to the Loan during 2016 are described below.

1425565_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	On July 9, 2014, the Company completed a private offering of approximately $7.0 million of its Class A common stock and warrants (the July 2014 PIPE Offering ) at a price per unit of $48.00 ($2.40 pre-reverse split).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	Subsequently, the Company s stock price has declined to $0.63 as of December 31, 2015 and five of the investors that participated in the offering (out of approximately 20 total investors that participated in the offering) have asserted claims against the Company in three separate lawsuits alleging certain misrepresentations and omissions in the offering.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	Effective July 15, 2015 the Company settled with the four investors.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P131_S3	The Company recorded a charge to operations of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2015, in recognition of the loss contingency for the July 2014 PIPE offering.

1425565_16_ITEM8_P132_S4	The Company and its legal advisors believe its expenses in responding to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena, which were incurred after June 30, 2015, should be fully paid by its insurance carrier as they are directly related to the July 2014 PIPE Offering and the Company reached its retention limit for that event during the second quarter of 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P132_S5	The Company s insurance carrier has denied coverage for these expenses on the grounds that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena does not constitute a claim covered by the policy, but has nevertheless agreed to advance funds to pay amounts we contend constitute defense costs, while reserving all rights, including the right to recoup all amounts advanced.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P132_S6	The Company vigorously disputes the position of the insurance carrier in this matter.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P132_S7	However, as any recovery the Company would receive in the future is a gain contingency, no assurances can be made that its insurance carrier will, ultimately pay for or reimburse these expenses, or any portion of these expenses.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	At this time, the Company is unable to determine the potential impact, if any, that may result from this investigation.

1425565_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	Any unreleased portion of the First Release Amount, the Second Release Amount, or any Subsequent Release Amount.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	The amount released pursuant to the Note and Deposit Account Control Agreement on each of these dates will be reduced to an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the shares of Class A common stock (i) covered by an effective resale registration statement, (ii) the Note holders are eligible to resell under Rule 144, or (iii) eligible for issuance under the Nasdaq continued listing rules without shareholder approval, until the Company has obtained such shareholder approval, if applicable, based on the conversion formula in the Notes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Notes are convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of Class A common stock at the lower of a fixed and floating conversion price.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	The initial fixed conversion price is $0.8033 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, and the like.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	The floating conversion price is equal to the lowest of (i) 85% of the arithmetic average of the five lowest volume-weighted average prices of the Class A common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes, (ii) 85% of the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes, and (iii) 85% of the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock on the trading day of the delivery of the applicable conversion notice by such holder of Notes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P162_S3	In no event may the conversion price be less than $0.25 per share.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P162_S4	If the conversion price to be used for calculating the shares of Common Stock issuable would have been less than $0.25 per share but for such limitation, the Company is obligated to issue shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.25 and pay cash to the Note holders in an amount calculated pursuant to formulas set forth in the Notes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	On the last business day of each month (the "Installment Dates"), commencing on July 29, 2016, the Company will pay the holders of the Notes a total amount equal to (1) $312,500 (1/32nd of the original principal amount of such holder's Note) or the principal outstanding on the Installment Date, if less, plus (2) the accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such principal, plus (3) the accrued and unpaid late charges (if any) with respect to such principal and interest.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	Prior to maturity, the Notes will bear interest at 8% per annum (or 15% per annum during an event of default) with interest payable monthly in arrears on the Installment Dates and on conversion dates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P163_S2	Each monthly payment may be made in cash, in shares of Class A common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P163_S3	The Company's ability to make such payments with shares of Class A common stock will be subject to satisfaction of various equity conditions during a 20 trading day-period before the applicable date of determination (the "Measurement Period"), including the existence of an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued in payment (or, in the alternative, the eligibility of the shares issuable pursuant to the Notes for resale without restriction under Rule 144 and without the need for registration), continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and a certain minimum trading volume and trading price in the stock to be issued.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P163_S4	Such shares will be valued at the lower of (1) the then applicable conversion price, (2) a price that is 85% of the arithmetic average of the five lowest volume-weighted average prices of Class A common stock during the 20 trading day period ending the trading day immediately before the date of determination, and (3) a price that is 85% of the volume-weighted average price of the Class A common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable date of determination.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	Any payments due to a Note holder may be off-set against any amount in such Note holder's collateral account described above.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	At December 31, 2015, RGS had the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	Each holder of the Company s Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	On December 31, 2011, Gaiam converted all of its holdings of the Company s Class B common stock to Class A common stock and, as a result, RGS has had no shares of Class B common stock outstanding since December 31, 2011.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P166_S2	Under the terms of the Company s articles of incorporation and merger with Alteris, RGS is prohibited from issuing Class B common stock in the future.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	All holders of Class A common stock vote as a single class on all matters that are submitted to the shareholders for a vote.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P167_S1	Accordingly, Riverside, as the holder of 13.7% of the Class A common stock and entitled to vote in any election of directors, may exert significant influence over the election of the directors.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	Shareholders with the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all of the shares entitled to vote were present and voted may consent to an action in writing and without a meeting under certain circumstances.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	Holders of the Company s Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Real Goods Solar, Class A common stock holders are entitled to share ratably in the Company s assets remaining after the payment of all debts and other liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P169_S2	Holders of Class A common stock have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company s Class A common stock.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P170_S2	FASB ASC No. 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures- Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 820-10-35 ), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P170_S3	ASC 820-10-35-3 also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P170_S4	Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	ASC 820-10-35 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
1425565_16_ITEM8_P171_S1	The statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P171_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	Level 1 Inputs Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	An active market is a market in which transactions occur for the item to be fair valued with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	Level 2 Inputs Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	Level 2 inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P174_S2	These inputs include: (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, such as when there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially over time or in which little information is released publicly; (c) Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and (d) Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	Level 3 Inputs Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	These inputs should be used to determine fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P175_S2	Unobservable inputs should be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include internally generated data and assumptions being used to price the asset or liability.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	For the Company s Level 3 measures, which represent common stock warrants, fair value is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model that is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company used a market approach to valuing these derivative liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning to the ending balance for the Company s common stock warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (i.e. Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2015:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company s share-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers, and directors to align shareholder and employee interests.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P182_S1	RGS primarily grants options under its 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but also granted 15,000 non-shareholder approved options to its chief executive officer during 2012 of which 10,500 were forfeited in 2014 and the remainder are set to expire in 2016.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company s 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provided that an aggregate of 1,844,161 shares of its Class A common stock may be awarded under the plan.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P183_S1	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P183_S2	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, service providers and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	Options vest based on service conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P185_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in RGS industry and its stock price volatility since our initial public offering.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P187_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	RGS does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	RGS is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P189_S1	RGS primarily uses plan life to-date forfeiture experience rate to estimate option forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	The following are the variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under the Company s incentive plans for each of the years presented:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	The table below presents a summary of our option activity as of December 31, 2015 and changes during the years then ended:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2015 and 2014 was $3.20 and $45.20, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P192_S1	The total fair value of shares vested was approximately $780,000 and $900,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P192_S2	The Company s share-based compensation cost charged against income for continuing operations was approximately $0.8 million and $1.3 million during the years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P192_S3	As of December 31, 2015, there was $0.6 million of unrecognized cost related to non-vested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P192_S4	The Company expects that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company s provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P195_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets shown on a gross basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	At December 31, 2015, RGS had $108.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring, if not utilized, beginning in 2021.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P196_S1	Additionally, the Company had $95.7 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring, it not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitation under applicable federal and state ownership change limitations and, accordingly, net operating losses may expire before utilization.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis through December 2015 and therefore has not determined the impact of any ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred in prior years.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P197_S2	Therefore, the net operating loss carryforwards above do not reflect any possible limitations and potential loss attributes to such ownership changes.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P197_S3	However, the Company believes that upon completion of a Section 382 analysis, as a result of prior period ownership changes, a significant portion of the net operating losses will be subject to limitation.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized benefits will increase or decrease within 12 months of the year ended December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	As a result of the net operating losses, substantially all of its federal, state and local income tax returns are subject to audit.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company s valuation allowance increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of its operating loss for the year.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P200_S2	Based upon the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P200_S3	At December 31, 2015, the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected taxable income from the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	The Company is required, under the terms of its tax sharing agreement with Gaiam, to distribute to Gaiam the tax effect of certain tax loss carryforwards as utilized by the Company in preparing its federal, state and local income tax returns.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	At December 31, 2015, utilizing an income tax rate of 35%, the Company estimates that the maximum amount of such distributions to Gaiam could aggregate $1.6 million.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	During 2014, the Company discontinued its former large commercial segment and sold the assets of the catalog segment.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P202_S1	As a result of this major strategic shift, the Company now operates as three reportable segments: (1) Residential the installation of solar energy systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and for small businesses (small commercial) in the continental U.S.; (2) Sunetric the installation of solar energy systems for both homeowners and business owners (commercial) in Hawaii; and (3) Other catalog, for 2014, and corporate operations.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	Financial information for the Company s segments and a reconciliation of the total of the reportable segments income (loss) from operations (measures of profit or loss) to the Company s consolidated net loss are as follows:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	The following is a reconciliation of reportable segments assets to the Company s consolidated total assets.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	The Other segment includes certain unallocated corporate amounts.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	On September 30, 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain net assets and rights comprising its large commercial installations business, otherwise known as its former Commercial segment, and focus its efforts and resources of its Residential and Sunetric segments.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	This represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, operating results, and operating and investing activities cash flows for the former Commercial segment are presented as a discontinued operation separate from the Company s continuing operations, for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and footnotes, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the major line items constituting pretax loss of discontinued operations to the after-tax loss of discontinued operations that are presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as indicated:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	(a) Included in the selling and operating expense for December 31, 2014 is $1.2 million related to the write-off of a certain account receivable.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	(b) Included in the general and administrative costs for December 31, 2014 is $1.6 million of share based compensation expense.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations to the total assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations presented separately in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as indicated:
1425565_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	Revolving Line of Credit for a discussion of the purchase of the Company s Loan Agreement by Solar Solutions and the associated modifications to the Loan Agreement.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	Shareholders Equity for information regarding the Company s 2016 private placement.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	On March 16, 2016 the Company received a notice from Continental Casualty Company that its directors and officers liability insurance policy which expires on May 8, 2015 would not be renewed and that there would be no coverage available after that date, based upon the risk no longer meeting underwriter guidelines.
1425565_16_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company intends to seek replacement coverage from another carrier.
1425565_16_ITEM9_P0_S0	As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 15, 2015 and incorporated herein by reference, effective April 9, 2015, our board of directors dismissed EKS H LLLP ( EKS H ), who was previously engaged as our principal accountant to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and effective April 13, 2015 we retained Hein Associates LLP as the our new independent accountants engaged as the principal accountant to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our chief executive officer and principal financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2015, they have concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	As of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter (June 30, 2015), our public float, as calculated in accordance with Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Rule 12b-2 ), was less than $50 million.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	As such, we became a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2) on such date.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	At the end of the current fiscal year, we ceased to be an accelerated filer and became a smaller reporting company.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We completed our remediation plan with respect to our material weaknesses identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1425565_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In making the assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (commonly referred to as the 2013 COSO framework).

1425565_16_ITEM15_P3_S0	* Indicates management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	RGS Energy and its subsidiaries ( we, us, or the Company ) provide solar energy systems to homeowners, and commercial building owners in the United States.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	We believe that solar energy adoption is still in the early stages and will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Company and its predecessors have installed over 25,000 solar energy systems across the continental United States and Hawaii since 1978.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	We endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our customers by managing and executing the process with our sales and installation teams.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	We design and offer a suitable solar energy solution, then procure, permit, install, and interconnect the system to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	We provide a comprehensive workmanship warranty on each fully operational system.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company was incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our goals are to (i) provide solar solutions that save residential and commercial customers money and (ii) operate our Company at a profit.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our strategies to achieve these goals are:
1425565_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Install systems in geographic areas that allow us to provide electricity savings to customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Currently we install in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii, and California.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	These states typically have higher utility rates, additional local incentives and rebates, high customer return on investment, and/or favorable utility and government policies.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	We routinely perform an assessment of potential expansion into other states, considering the prevailing utility rates, local incentives and rebates to assess customer receptivity of our product based upon the potential customer return on investment.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	During the past three years we have built a call center in our headquarters in Colorado to conduct sales via the phone and internet.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	This provides a cost-effective mechanism to reach potential customers and readily enter new markets.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	Call center personnel have access to engineering, operations, customer support and other services personnel at our headquarters location allowing them to quickly address any questions that might arise during the sales process.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Many prospective customers request a face-to-face meeting, so we utilize field sales staff in locations where it is cost-effective to do so; currently in the North Eastern United States and Hawaii.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Continue to drive growth through referrals networks.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We pay customers for referring additional customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We will continue to expand these programs through the call center, post-install in-home parties, user-friendly software, and digital marketing.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Installation capacity needs to match sales demand around the country to install solar systems with the shortest cycle time possible.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our installations are performed by both in-house crews and our authorized integrator network.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Identify attractive financing options for customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We refer our customers to a variety of options for financing their solar energy systems including home improvement loans, equipment leases and power purchase agreements.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe our clients select us because:
1425565_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have been in the solar industry for 39 years.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our customers can utilize cash, loan, and leasing/power purchase agreements.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We are located in states where utility costs are high and/or incentives for solar energy systems are available , therefore offering an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	We are a design-build provider of turnkey solar energy systems providing design, engineering, financing, procurement, permitting, installing, grid interconnection, monitoring, and maintenance services.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We install residential systems generally between 3 kilowatts ( kW ) and 10 kW, and commercial systems up to 500 kW in size, depending on the amount of electricity used by the customer and the size of their building.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	The size of the average solar energy system we installed during 2016 was approximately 7 kW. We maintain a service department to manage and assist with service and repairs, and to provide operations and maintenance service contracts for larger projects.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	We design and build solar energy systems to meet each customer s individual needs and circumstances.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	We assess a customer s annual power requirements and average electricity rates to size the solar system and engineer its interconnection to the grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	We assess the customer s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S6	We factor in information about the customer s electrical service territory, rate structures, budget, preferred financing method and aesthetic preferences.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S7	We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates, benefits of net metering, and various other factors.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P17_S8	We assess this data using solar production tools and analytical models to size and configure a cost-effective solar system for the customer and one that offers a return on investment to the customer that meets their requirements.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We prepare construction plans to obtain a building permit, which is necessary for grid interconnection and state incentive rebate processing.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We also provide customers with a return-on-investment analysis which reflects the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Once all necessary approvals from financing partners and utilities, and incentive, rebate and jurisdictional authorities have been received, our in-house construction teams or authorized integrators begin the installation of the customer s solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Once the solar energy system has been installed, we arrange for a final inspection by the local building department and complete final as-built drawings of the system to submit applicable applications for the jurisdictional rebate(s), and at the same time, apply to the local utility company to finalize interconnection of the customer s solar energy system to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The most visible component of solar energy systems are the photovoltaic modules which transform the sunlight into direct electrical current ( DC ), which then travels to the inverter.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The inverter converts the DC electricity into useable alternating current ( AC ) that matches the current of the household electrical service and the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	The electricity created can go onto the grid or be used by the customer to power household items such as lights and appliances.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	The other major components are the metal racking which holds the solar modules in place on the roof or ground, the monitoring which tracks the solar production of the system, and balance of system which includes clamps and electrical parts.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	We do not manufacture any of these components.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P20_S5	We purchase all components from the manufacturer or their distributors.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We and our suppliers offer warranties of up to 10 years for parts and labor, including property damage arising from workmanship, excluding roof penetrations which are generally warrantied for a period of 5 years.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	All major components installed in a photovoltaic system array are covered under transferable manufacturers warranties, which generally range from 10 to 25 years.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Customer claims are processed through our customer service department.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	We will provide reasonable assistance to our customers in contacting the manufacturer concerning warranty service and undertake reasonable effort to recoup our labor costs from the manufacturer.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	We offer customers a choice to finance their solar systems with their cash, third party loans, or third party leases or power purchase agreements.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We are constantly vetting new financing products and only refer the ones that fit the customer s needs and desires.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our menu of finance offerings allows us to provide solar energy systems to our customers with financing terms that we believe are economically attractive for their individual situation.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We market and sell our products and services through a national sales organization that includes a direct outside sales force on the east coast and Hawaii, a call center at our headquarters, channel partners, and a customer referral program.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We have trained our sales organization to effectively engage prospective customers from initial interest to customized proposals to signed contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	We intend to continue growing our sales teams and will continue to educate consumers about the benefits of our solar products in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and further expand the market opportunity.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our inside sales groups initially engage with potential customers prior to our outside sales or e-sales teams customer engagement.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Inside sales groups identify each potential customer s initial interest in solar energy and compile data necessary to assess potential cost savings for subsequent discussion with the potential customer by the sales teams.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Direct outside sales Our outside sales force works in the east coast markets and Hawaii to generate new business and complete sales orders initiated by inside sales groups from their own networking, at local events and by establishing local business alliances.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	The outside sales team visits potential customers in their homes or businesses, explaining the advantages of solar energy, answering customer questions and facilitating new sales orders.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	E-sales The e-sales teams provide an online, real time, complete customer experience.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	We use software and satellite imagery to review the customer s rooftop for suitability and system capacity, and based on the customer s current utility costs assess the project s potential cost savings from installation of the solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	We utilize electronic contracts and digital signatures.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Customer referrals Our customer referral program is designed to be an effective and efficient method of reaching new customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our program provides cash incentives to current customers to refer friends, relatives and co-workers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Alliances and Channel Partnerships We endeavor to generate referrals from programs with small local businesses and large regional partnerships to reach a larger target audience.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Online Digital Marketing Consumers seek online education, purchase options, and business reviews before determining the best provider to meet their needs.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	In an effort to align our business with marketplace, and our E-sales teams with the consumer, we will continue to expand our online market presence.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to clean, renewable energy.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations up to 24kW in size.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service and municipal services.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Often times, our small commercial clients arise from the relationship developed when we install a residential solar system to the owner of the small business.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally up to 500kW in size.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	These customers do not include any large commercial customers that were previously in discontinued operations.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P31_S4	Discontinued Operations in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our solar energy systems utilize photovoltaic modules and inverters purchased from several manufacturers and distributors; the majority of these materials are Buy American under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil based alternatives.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	The other source of competition comes from other solar providers such as, SolarCity Corporation, Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Sungevity, Inc., and many others.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	We prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA , and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	We expend resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any public works construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our in-house personnel monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Some jurisdictions place limits on the size or number of solar energy systems that can be interconnected to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	This can limit our ability to sell and install solar energy systems in some markets.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The regulatory environment is constantly changing.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, production-based incentives, tax abatements and rebates.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Following the extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in December 2015, the Internal Revenue Code allows a United States taxpayer to claim a tax credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2019.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	This credit is scheduled to decline to 26% effective January 1, 2020, 22% in 2021, and then to 10% for commercial projects and 0% for residential projects in 2022.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Many U.S. states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Some states have established limits on net metering, imposed monthly or other fees on solar energy systems, or reduced the credit available for electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	For example, Hawaii, Nevada and Mississippi have recently announced net metering policies that establish wholesale rates, not retail rates, for crediting electricity produced by solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	This has adversely impacted the attractiveness of solar to residential customers in these markets.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	The California Public Utilities Commission recently issued a new ruling that maintains the net energy metering credit at full retail value, but adds new charges and requirements for customers installing a solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	On the other hand, other states continue to expand their net metering programs.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P44_S5	New York, for example, has suspended its cap on solar photovoltaic systems covered by the state s net metering program.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Some states like Massachusetts offer Solar Renewable Energy Credits ( SRECs ) that provide cash payments based on the electricity produced by solar energy systems as an incentive for customers to invest in these systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	These programs are generally capped and must be reauthorized or extended when the cap is reached in order for the incentives to be continued.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources recently announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017 by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, called Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target ( SMART ), is targeted to start in January 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have, in the past, and may, in the future, fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	We have historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our lowest installation quarter of the year, primarily due to adverse weather.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	We have historically experienced seasonality in our sales of solar systems, with the fourth and first quarters of the year seeing less sales orders than the second and third quarters.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	As of March 6, 2017, we had approximately 160 full-time employees.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	On June 2, 2016, we consummated a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock at a ratio of one-for-20, whereby 20 shares of Class A common stock were combined into one share of Class A common stock (the 2016 Reverse Stock Split ).
1425565_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	The 2016 Reverse Split was previously authorized by a vote of our shareholders on May 27, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We did not decrease our authorized shares of capital stock in connection with the 2016 Reverse Stock Split.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock at a ratio of one-for-30, whereby 30 shares of Class A common stock were combined into one share of Class A common stock (the 2017 Reverse Stock Split ).
1425565_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	The 2017 Reverse Stock Split was previously authorized by a vote of our shareholders on January 23, 2017.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	We did not decrease our authorized shares of capital stock in connection with the reverse stock split.
1425565_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Share amounts and share prices set forth in this Annual Report are presented to reflect the reverse splits, as applicable.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $183 million as of December 31, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We need to increase our sales, installations and revenue in order to achieve our goal of initially operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our current levels of sales, installations and revenue are insufficient for profitable operations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We have developed plans, to be implemented during 2017, to increase sales and installation revenue.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We believe that the recently obtained additional financial resources allow us to begin to implement our plans.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If we are unsuccessful in executing these plans, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We need to grow our backlog or we will be unable to increase revenue.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We did not have access to financial capital to implement our revenue growth strategy until the fourth quarter of 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our backlog and sales headcount each decreased during 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	To grow our backlog, we need to hire and train new salespersons, and bid upon and be awarded new customer sales.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	While we implement our revenue growth strategy, and until we build a larger backlog, our installation revenue will fluctuate by quarter.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If we are unsuccessful in building a larger backlog, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and we will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even and achieving profitability thereafter.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have a history of negative cash flows from operations, and it is uncertain when, or if, in the future we will be able to achieve or sustain positive cash flow from operations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There can be no assurance in the future that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, future financings or other sources to fund operations or other liquidity needs which could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future operating performance and our ability to service indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our future indebtedness may impose restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We currently are not party to any loan agreement providing for a revolving credit facility or term loan, but have been in the recent past.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	However, if we in the future enter into a loan agreement, our future indebtedness may impose various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The restrictions imposed under these debt instruments may include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of future indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we would be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If there were an event of default under future indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt would likely be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under applicable indebtedness if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such indebtedness.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Existing rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering , which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In some states, net metering is being replaced with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	For example, in October, 2015, the Hawaiian Electric Companies, the primary utility in Hawaii, announced that it was replacing its net metering program with a new grid supply program that credits excess electricity sent onto the grid by a solar energy system at a fixed rate of between 15 cents per kilowatt-hour and 27 cents per kilowatt hour, rather than at the higher retail rates available under the prior net-metering program and also imposes a minimum monthly bill of $25 dollars for owners of solar energy systems that remain connected to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Many jurisdictions also impose caps which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Some utilities also restrict the amount of consumer-owned electricity generation that can be placed on a circuit and may require special studies or equipment before such generation can be connected to the utility grid.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems and deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require the price of solar energy systems to be reduced in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	U.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	For example, The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources recently announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017 by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, SMART, is targeted to start in January 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Massachusetts accounted for a significant amount of our sales in 2016, and had the program not been extended, our sales in Massachusetts would have likely declined significantly.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	For installation projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis or payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	For projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis our revenue from these installations is determined by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Although we generally have payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We experience spikes in orders during the spring and summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the summer and fall.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and whether customers are looking to take advantage of such incentives before the end of the year.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our ability to construct systems outdoors may be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flow.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that cease to be attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function or quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, California and Hawaii.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may incur fines and other penalties if we do not conduct our business in accordance with licenses required for our operations and if any such license is suspended or lost, we may be unable to sell or install solar energy systems in the jurisdiction in question and our sales and revenue from that jurisdiction would be adversely affected.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As a construction company we are required to hold general or specialty contractors licenses in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, although in other jurisdictions we are permitted to utilize the licenses of subcontractors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Some jurisdictions also require licenses to sell home improvement products or services, or to issue consumer credit.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we violate the rules of these licensing authorities, we may incur fines or other penalties or have our licenses suspended or cancelled.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Some licenses require us to employ personnel with specific qualifications.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If we lose those personnel, we may lose our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction until we can hire a qualified replacement.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The loss of personnel or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The expansion of our business could significantly strain our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defects in material and workmanship.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Although we maintain an estimated liability for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our recorded liability could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment, the ultimate resolution of which could have a material impact upon our results of operations and financial position.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	As previously disclosed, and as discussed in Item 3 of Part I, we have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment wherein the customer alleges that we have not completed agreed-upon remedial work to remedy alleged deficiencies, and has notified us that the customer intends to perform such work at our expense using a third-party contractor.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In addition, the customer demanded an aggregate of approximately $400,000 as liquidated damages under the terms of the project contract.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We estimate that the range of loss related to this warranty claim is from approximately $200,000 to a maximum of approximately $1 million.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If we have to compensate the customer for its remedial work or pay the customer liquidated damages, it would negatively impact our results of operations and result in a significant use of cash.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The ultimate resolution of our dispute with our insurance carrier could result in the significant outlay of cash.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As previously disclosed, we have incurred legal expenses of $1.5 million in connection with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into our July 2014 private placement.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The investigation was ultimately closed without action by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we and our legal advisors believe the legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation should be fully paid by our insurance carrier.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our insurance carrier has paid these legal expenses but informed us that if it concludes that such expenses do not constitute a claim covered by the policy, they would seek to recoup all amounts advanced.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	As such, we have recorded the advanced funds as a deferred liability.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If our insurance carrier were to pursue reimbursement and prevailed in recouping the amounts advanced, it would not affect results of operations but would result in a significant use of cash.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers, installers and other vendors, and if these companies were unable to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted solar companies such as us.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Shortages of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Manufacturers of photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in photovoltaic modules.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	A significant percentage of photovoltaic modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2015 were sourced from North American manufacturers, we have experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Factors that may prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget include:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Because the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	access to materials, labor and installation services.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Solar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and maintain insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Availability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Many of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price of our solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Third-party financing sources may also charge significant fees for their financing products.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P75_S5	However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance most of our sales of solar energy systems.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Third-party financing sources, specifically for solar energy systems, are currently limited.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit, or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses, could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P81_S3	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on technology, computer systems, third-party service providers, and our website for obtaining and storing certain information.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our business requires us to receive, retain and transmit personally identifiable information and other information about our customers, suppliers and employees, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and other businesses we interact with.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyber-attack, computer malware or viruses, employee error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement (including so-called social engineering attacks and phishing scams) or other acts.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Costs associated with our past security breach have not been significant.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Unauthorized parties have previously obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers, suppliers or employees or may otherwise cause damage or interfere with our technology, computer systems or website.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S4	We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, privacy and information security regulations change, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P83_S5	We have taken, and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such information and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but there can be no assurance that our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with will not be compromised, and such compromise could result in such information being obtained by unauthorized persons, adverse operational effects or interruptions, substantial additional costs or being subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could damage our reputation in the marketplace or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Capital Market independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the Nasdaq Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet Nasdaq s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Future volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	As of March 6, 2017, there were an aggregate of approximately 6.5 million shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The exercise price under certain of our outstanding warrants is subject to reset in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	For example, the exercise price of our Series I warrants is subject to a reset.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If the exercise price in effect on April 1, 2017 is higher than the lowest daily volume weighted average price (as defined in our Series I warrants) of our Class A common stock on any trading day during the month of March 2017, the exercise price is reset to such lower price, but in no event lower than $0.10.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Further, the exercise price of our Series H warrants is subject to reset at the earlier to occur of (a) the repayment in full of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due April 1, 2019 (the Notes ), and (b) the maturity date of the Notes.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P93_S5	If on such date the exercise price of our Series H warrants exceeds 85% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock for the five trading days ending on, but including, the adjustment date, the exercise price will be reset to such lower price.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P99_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The terms of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock and securities purchase agreement entered into with investors participating in our past offerings could impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The terms of our Notes and some of our outstanding series of warrants to purchase Class A common stock prohibit us from entering into a fundamental transaction (as defined in the Notes and such warrants) (including generally, a merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or permitting a purchase tender or exchange offering resulting in a person or group of persons owning at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock) unless the successor resulting from the fundamental transaction assumes all of our obligations under the Notes and the warrants and the associated transaction documents, and, if a successor is publicly-traded, at a holder s request, such successor issues substantially similar substitute securities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In addition, the securities purchase agreements we entered into in connection with our offering of Class A common stock and warrants closed February 6, 2017 and February 9, 2017 prohibit us from offering, selling, granting any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, or being part of any solicitations, negotiations or discussions with regard to, any of our or our subsidiaries equity securities or equity equivalent securities until May 7, 2017 and May 10, 2017, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	These covenants will restrict our ability to enter into certain fundamental transactions or obtain additional financing in the future without a waiver.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The terms of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock could result in our paying premiums or penalties to the holders of or outstanding warrants.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our outstanding warrants require us to deliver the number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise within a specified time period.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	If we are unable to deliver the shares of Class A common stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holder for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the conversion or exercise and sale of such shares.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P111_S2	The payments we may be obligated to make to the holders of our outstanding warrants may adversely affect our results of operations.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We must meet The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease the per share price of our Class A common stock and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P113_S1	We must continue to satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	As previously disclosed, we are currently subject to a Panel Monitor through January 15, 2018.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We have failed to comply with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements in the past and there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy Nasdaq s minimum shareholders equity requirement or any other applicable listing requirement during the monitoring period or thereafter.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If our Class A common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P115_S2	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	In addition to the foregoing, if our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P117_S1	The last reported trade of our Company Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was at a price below $5.00 per share.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P117_S2	If our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our Class A common stock would be considered a penny stock.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P118_S1	The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P118_S2	In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s agreement to the transaction.
1425565_17_ITEM1A_P118_S3	If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our Class A common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our Class A common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.
1425565_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in Denver, Colorado.
1425565_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities:
1425565_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 1 month to 5 years.
1425565_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol RGSE.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 6, 2017, we had approximately 103 shareholders of record and 7,480,906 shares of $.0001 par value Class A common stock and no shares of $.0001 par value Class B common stock outstanding.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low close prices for our Class A common stock for the periods indicated:
1425565_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	In addition, the terms of our Notes prohibit us from making any dividend payment until all of the Notes have been converted, redeemed, or otherwise satisfied.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	As previously reported, on April 1, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $10,000,000 principal amount of Notes.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	The terms of the Notes permit us to pay principal and interest in shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P3_S2	The Notes are convertible at any time, at the option of the holders, into shares of our Class A common stock at the lower of a fixed and floating conversion price.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Between April 1, 2016 (beginning on October 3, 2016) and December 31, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 498,910 shares of Class A common stock to the holders of the Notes as payment of an aggregate of $9,914,490 of principal and interest owed under the Notes at per share prices between $5.47 and $52.21.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	The conversion features and terms of the Notes are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2016 and these descriptions are incorporated herein by reference.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	As previously reported, the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon repayment of principal and interest and upon conversion of the Notes was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the Securities Act ) Section 4(a)(2) and Securities Act Rule 506(b).
1425565_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	The holders of the Notes are sophisticated, accredited investors and acquired the Notes for their own accounts for investment purposes.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P6_S2	Further, the transaction documents pursuant to which the holders purchased the Notes state that the securities in question have not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold or otherwise transferred without registration or an exemption therefrom and provide for the placement of a restrictive legend on any stock certificates issued upon conversion of the Notes, subject to the terms of the transaction documents.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	All other unregistered sales of equity securities during 2016 have been previously reported in Current Reports on Form 8-K.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	See section entitled Equity Compensation Plan Information in Item 12.
1425565_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	During 2014, we committed to a plan to sell certain contracts and rights comprising our large commercial installations business, otherwise known as our former Commercial segment.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	At the same time, we determined not to enter into further large commercial installation contracts in the mainland United States.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Most contracts in process at December 31, 2014 were substantially completed during 2015 and remaining work was completed in 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	We now report this business as a discontinued operation, separate from our continuing operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	The following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is for our continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement and construction firm.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We also perform most of our own sales and marketing activities to generate leads and secure projects.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	We offer turnkey services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our solar energy systems use high-quality solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We use proven technologies and techniques to help customers achieve savings by reducing their utility costs.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition, we help customers lower their emissions output and reliance upon fossil fuel energy sources.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	We, including our predecessors, have more than 39 years of experience in residential solar energy and trace our roots to 1978, when Real Goods Trading Corporation sold the first solar photovoltaic panels in the United States.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have designed and installed over 25,000 residential and commercial solar systems since our founding.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	During 2014, we discontinued our entire former Commercial segment and sold the assets associated with our catalog segment (a portion of the Other segment).
1425565_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	As a result of this major strategic shift, we now operate as three reportable segments: (1) Residential the installation of solar energy systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and for small businesses (small commercial) in the continental U.S.; (2) Sunetric the installation of solar energy systems for both homeowners and business owners (commercial) in Hawaii; and (3) Other corporate operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe this structure enables us to more effectively manage our operations and resources.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to our customers when we install the solar energy system.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our business requires that we incur costs of acquiring solar panels and labor to install solar energy systems on our customer rooftops up-front and receive cash from customers thereafter.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	As a result, during periods when we are increasing sales, we expect to have negative cash flow from operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue that we may recognize in the future from signed contracts to install solar energy systems that have not yet been installed without taking into account possible future cancellations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Backlog is not a measure defined by GAAP, and is not a measure of contract profitability.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	The backlog amounts we disclose are net of cancellations and include anticipated revenues associated with (i) the original contract amounts, and (ii) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	We can provide no assurance as to the profitability of our contracts reflected in backlog.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following table summarizes changes to our backlog by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016:
1425565_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We have experienced a high level of contract cancellations, which we attribute to (i) the fact that our financial condition, as previously disclosed, limited our access to solar panels such that we were not able to install solar energy systems in a time frame to satisfy certain customers, and (ii) our history of operating losses and resulting declining stock price affecting customer decisions.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	We determined that for optimum internal operations, and customer satisfaction, that a backlog equivalent to a few months of sales is optimal.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We did not emphasize originating new sales during 2016 as we did not have sufficient financial capital for growth.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We intend to continue the optimization of our e-sales call -center- based sales organization with the goal of increasing our future sales awards, both for our current states of operation and new states where we may operate in future periods.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our customers currently finance their acquisition of solar energy systems using their own cash, or a loan they receive from a financial provider.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that to be successful in increasing our sales and resultant revenue, we intend to do the following as part of our revenue growth strategy:
1425565_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Commence sales into new states of operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	In order to execute our revenue growth strategy, we required additional financial capital.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	We compete with larger, better-financed firms for customers, employees, and the services of third party financiers and installers and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in meeting our goals for increasing sales and revenue.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In conjunction with our plans to position our company for future profitable operations, we have:
1425565_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Reduced selling and operating and general and administrative expenses with the goal of lowering the required amount of future revenue to achieve break-even, or better, operating results in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	In 2016, we raised net proceeds of $16.5 million from offerings of Notes, convertible preferred stock, Class A common stock and warrants.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	In February 2017, we raised net proceeds of $16.1 million from offerings of Class A common stock and warrants.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Utilizing the proceeds from the offerings discussed above, we have (i) become current with our vendors, (ii) repaid and terminated our former line-of-credit facility, and (iii) began to expand the size of our sales and construction organizations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	In addition, we consummated the 2016 Reverse Stock Split and the 2017 Reverse Stock Split as described further under the heading Reverse Stock Splits in Item 1.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kW, residential and small commercial customers , we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Components are principally comprised of photovoltaic panels, inverters, and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	For those systems of 100 kW or greater, commercial customers, we recognize revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We invoice commercial customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as photovoltaic modules and inverters) located at our warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	We write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	We warrant solar energy systems sold to customers for up to ten years against defects in material or installation workmanship.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	We generally provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	We also maintain specific warranty liabilities for large commercial customers included in discontinued operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	We assess the accrued warranty reserve regularly and adjust the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Goodwill and purchased intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	We account for complex financial instruments including convertible notes, convertible preferred stock, and warrants under ASC 815 and ASC 480.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	We utilize third party appraisers to determine the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	For financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, we defer and amortize to operations costs incurred including the initial fair value of warrants issued and derivative liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	The issuance costs of financial instruments accounted for as equity are charged to additional paid in capital.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The extinguishment of financial instruments accounted for as debt that are extinguished by issuance of common stock are recorded at the fair value of common stock issued at the date of issuance, with any difference from the carrying value of the liability recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We recognize compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition for performance based awards or over a service period for time based awards.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 10.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	Share-Based Compensation in Item 8 of this Annual Report), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carry-forward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net revenue decreased $28.1 million, or 61.7%, to $17.4 million during 2016, from $45.5 million during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in revenue reflects a decrease in solar systems constructed to 4.1 megawatts in 2016 from 10.8 megawatts in 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Net revenue for our residential segment decreased $16.9 million, or 56.1%, to $13.3 million during 2016, from $30.2 million during 2015, primarily due to a lack of access to capital for growth, causing delays in material purchases and limited access to third party installers.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Net revenue for our Sunetric segment decreased by $11.1 million, or 72.9% to $4.2 million during 2016, from $15.3 million during 2015 primarily due to the local utility limiting interconnection applications.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	This represents the installment of 1.1 megawatts in 2016 in comparison to 3.8 megawatts in 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Gross profit decreased $4.6 million, or 70.8%, to $1.9 million during 2016, from $6.4 million during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Gross profit percentage decreased to 10.8% during 2016 from 14.1% during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in the residential segment s gross profit percentage was due to the proportionate greater absorption of fixed costs associated with the decline in revenue from the prior year.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling and operating expenses decreased $6.9 million, or 50.0%, to $7.0 million during 2016 from $13.9 million during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The decrease in the residential segment s selling and operating expenses was attributable to the reduction of revenue and headcount, and management s decision to reduce the costs of customer leads.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	General and administrative expenses decreased, consistent with the approach for selling and operating expenses to reduce expenses in proportion to the declines in revenue, approximately $0.6 million, or 9.8%, to $5.3 million during 2016, from $5.8 million during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Litigation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 were negligible compared to litigation expenses of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing the legal costs of responding to the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena and settlements with investors in our July 2014 PIPE Offering, as more fully described in Note 6.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Other income/expense was $0.0 million in 2016 compared to $0.4 million during 2015, which was due primarily to the gain on sale of fully depreciated assets.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Interest expense increased approximately $2 million primarily due to interest expense and amortization of deferred loan costs related to our $10 million offering of Notes.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Change in fair value of derivative liabilities and loss on debt extinguishment .
1425565_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	During 2016, $11.4 million of noncash loss on debt extinguishment was the result of the Company s stock trading price exceeding the carrying value of the Notes upon conversion of class A common stock for the debt, and the noncash gain on the derivative liability associated with the debt conversions.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	During 2015, we recorded noncash gains of $7.1 million primarily due to our stock price decreasing resulting in reductions to the fair value of the common stock warrant liability.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our trend in cash flow for the prior two years is as follows:
1425565_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Because of these losses, we did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from our equipment suppliers that limited our ability to convert our backlog in an expeditious manner, which resulted in customer cancellations of contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Starting with the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented measures to reduce our cash outflow for operations such that the required level of sales to achieve break-even results was reduced.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for our products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	net cash outflow from continuing operations.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	To execute our revenue growth strategy and reduce our payables and indebtedness, during 2016 the Company obtained additional financial capital through the following transactions:
1425565_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	On September 14, 2016, the Company issued $2.8 million of Series A 12.5% Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and Series H warrants exercisable into 16,970 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $2.2 million in cash, and received $1.6 million from the exercise of Series H warrants into 9,515 shares of our Class A common stock on September 30, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2016, all of the convertible preferred stock had been converted into Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	On December 13, 2016, the Company issued $4.1 million of Class A common stock and Series I warrants exercisable into 616,667 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $3.6 million in cash.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Further, in 2017, the Company had the opportunity to raise additional capital under the current full-shelf registration.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	On February 6, 2017, the Company issued $11.5 million of Class A common stock, and Series K warrants exercisable into 3,710,000 shares of our Class A common stock and Series L warrants exercisable into 1,613,080 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $10.6 million in cash at closing.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	On February 9, 2017, the Company issued $6.0 million of Class A common stock, and Series M warrants exercisable into 1,800,000 shares of our Class A common stock, and Series N warrants exercisable into 750,000 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $5.5 million in cash at closing.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has used the proceeds from the additional financial capital to reduce accounts payable, purchase materials to convert its backlog to revenue, begin to execute its growth strategy and for other corporate purposes.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company has prepared its business plan for the ensuing twelve months, and as described below, believes it has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12-month period.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company s objectives in preparing this plan include expanding the size of the Company s sales and construction organizations to generate gross margin that is more than its reduced fixed operating cost infrastructure and thereby reducing the Company s present operating losses in order to return the Company to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, of which substantially all non-sales and construction staff reductions had been realized as of December 31, 2016, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) hiring and training additional field and e-sales force personnel to grow sales, (iv) optimizing the Company s construction capability through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of the Company s backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, (vi) realizing the benefits of new vendor terms negotiated by the Company that reduce the cost of materials acquired by the Company, and (vii) increasing sales and installations with small commercial customers.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	The Company believes that because of (i) the additional financial capital realized during 2016 and 2017, as described above, and (ii) the actions it has already implemented to reduce its fixed operating cost infrastructure and to reduce the cost of materials, the Company has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our operating activities used net cash of $11.3 million and $14.2 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our net cash used in operating activities during 2016 was primarily attributable to our net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.0 million, a decrease in liabilities of $0.5 million, offset by a decrease in current assets of $3.2 million.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Our net cash used by operating activities during 2015 was primarily attributable to our net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $5.5 million, a decrease in current liabilities of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in current assets of $9.0 million.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our net cash used by investing activities during 2016 was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Our net cash provided by investing activities during 2015 was primarily distributable proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily the result of net proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $1.6 million, proceeds from convertible debt of $8.9 million, proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $2.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock of $3.6 million and offset by our pay down of our revolving line of credit.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily the result of net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A common stock and warrants of $15.0 million and offset by our pay down of our revolving line of credit.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The projects in this segment were primarily installed during 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	The net cash inflow for 2015 represents collections of accounts receivable.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	2016 s net cash outflow primarily arose from the cash payment for a surety bond, coupled with payments of accounts payable.
1425565_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1425565_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( RGS or the Company ) is a residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RGS and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	RGS has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which include the Company s accounts and those of its subsidiaries.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company reports all share and per share amounts reflecting the most recent reverse stock split.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	During 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain contracts and rights comprised of the Company s large commercial installations business, otherwise known as the Company s former Commercial segment.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	At the same time, the Company determined not to enter into further large commercial installation contracts in the mainland United States.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	Most contracts in process at December 31, 2014 were substantially completed during 2015 and remaining work was completed in 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company now reports this business as a discontinued operation, separate from the Company s continuing operations.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P12_S4	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is for the Company s continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in recent years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Because of these losses, we did not pay vendors on a timely basis and, accordingly, experienced difficulties obtaining credit terms from our equipment suppliers that limited our ability to convert our backlog in an expeditious manner, which resulted in customer cancellations of contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Starting with the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented measures to reduce our cash outflow for operations such that the required level of sales to achieve break-even results was reduced.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	These measures included (i) exiting the large commercial segment which was operating at both an operating and cash flow loss, (ii) reducing staffing levels, (iii) raising prices for our products and (iv) efforts to enhance accounts receivable collections and optimize inventory levels.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	net cash outflow from continuing operations.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	To execute our revenue growth strategy and reduce our payables and indebtedness, during 2016 the Company obtained additional financial capital through the following transactions:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	On September 14, 2016, the Company issued $2.8 million of Series A 12.5% Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and Series H warrants exercisable into 16,970 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $2.2 million in cash, and received $1.6 million from the exercise of Series H warrants into 9,515 shares of our Class A common stock on September 30, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2016, all of the convertible preferred stock had been converted into Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	On December 13, 2016, the Company issued $4.1 million of Class A common stock and Series I warrants exercisable into 616,667 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $3.6 million in cash.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Further, in 2017, the Company had the opportunity to raise additional capital under the current full-shelf registration.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	On February 6, 2017, the Company issued $11.5 million of Class A common stock, and Series K warrants exercisable into 3,710,000 shares of our Class A common stock and Series L warrants exercisable into 1,613,080 shares of our Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $10.6 million in cash at closing.

1425565_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company received, after offering costs, $5.5 million in cash at closing.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company has used the proceeds from the additional financial capital to reduce accounts payable, purchase materials to convert its backlog to revenue, begin to execute its growth strategy and for other corporate purposes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company has prepared its business plan for the ensuing twelve months, and as described below, believes it has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12-month period.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company s objectives in preparing this plan include expanding the size of the Company s sales and construction organizations to generate gross margin that is more than its reduced fixed operating cost infrastructure and thereby reducing the Company s present operating losses in order to return the Company to profitable operations in the future.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Elements of this plan include, among others, (i) realizing operating costs savings from reductions in staff, of which substantially all non-sales and construction staff reductions had been realized as of December 31, 2016, (ii) the positive impact of the strategic decision to exit the large commercial segment which operated at both a substantial cash and operating loss, (iii) hiring and training additional field and e-sales force personnel to grow sales, (iv) optimizing the Company s construction capability through authorized third-party integrators to realize the revenue from installation of the Company s backlog and minimize the impact on gross margin of idle construction crew time, (v) changing the mix of marketing expenditures to achieve a lower cost of acquisition than that employed in prior periods, (vi) realizing the benefits of new vendor terms negotiated by the Company that reduce the cost of materials acquired by the Company, and (vii) increasing sales and installations with small commercial customers.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	The Company believes that because of (i) the additional financial capital realized during 2016 and 2017, as described above, and (ii) the actions it has already implemented to reduce its fixed operating cost infrastructure and to reduce the cost of materials, the Company has sufficient financial resources to operate for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	No changes were made to the Company s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Significant estimates are used to value warranty liabilities, the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments, common stock warrants, and allowance for doubtful accounts.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The reclassifications did not impact prior period results of operations, cash flows, total assets, total liabilities or total equity.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company makes estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at Company warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company provides an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory items based on an estimate of the markdown to the retail price required to sell or dispose of such items.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	The Company has an allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventory of $0.5 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	RGS amortizes leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively, customer relationships ), trademarks, and non-compete agreements are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P34_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about the Company s future cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage its business.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kilowatts (kW), residential and small commercial customers, the Company recognizes revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Components comprise of photovoltaic panels and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	For those systems of 100kW or greater, commercial customers, the Company recognizes revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company invoices large installation customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	Unbilled receivables were included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The Company measures compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 10.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P47_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P48_S4	RGS has significant net operating loss carry-forwards and evaluates at the end of each reporting period whether it expects it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable and provides a tax valuation allowance as necessary.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company warrants solar energy systems sold to customers for up to 10 years against defects in material or installation workmanship.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	The Company also maintains specific warranty liabilities for large commercial customers included in discontinued operations.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P49_S4	The Company assesses the accrued warranty reserve regularly and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	RGS computes net loss per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares of the Company s Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Common share equivalents of 843,163 and 2,678 shares have been omitted from net loss per share for 2016 and 2015, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company did not have any customer who accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, nor did it have any customer representing over 10% of sales during 2016 or 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a supply agreement with its line-of-credit lender whereby certain identified materials were to be purchased through the lender s distribution business.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	As a result, approximately 90% of purchases were purchased from this distributor during 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	During January 2017, the line-of-credit was repaid in full and terminated along with the supply agreement.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	During 2015, the Company purchased approximately 50% of the major components for its solar installations from three suppliers.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company s chief operating decision maker is the executive team.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate the resources and in assessing the performance of the Company, the Company has determined that it has three reporting segments: residential solar installations, Sunetric installations, and corporate expenses ( other segment ).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company accounts for complex financial instruments including convertible notes, convertible preferred stock, and warrants under ASC 815 and ASC 480.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company utilizes third party appraisers to determine the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	Certain of the Company s warrants are accounted for as liabilities due to provisions either allowing the warrant holder to request redemption, at the intrinsic value of the warrant, upon a change of control and/or providing for an adjustment to the number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock underlying the warrants and the exercise price in connection with dilutive future funding transactions.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company classifies these derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as current and long term liabilities, which are revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to their initial issuance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	For financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, the Company defers and amortizes to operations costs incurred including the initial fair value of warrants issued and derivative liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The issuance costs of financial instruments accounted for as equity are charged to additional paid in capital.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The extinguishment of financial instruments accounted for as debt that are extinguished by issuance of common stock are recorded at the fair value of common stock issued at the date of issuance, with any difference from the carrying value of the liability recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASC 820 requires that the valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	To determine lease classification, the Company evaluates lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life, or whether the present value of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	All of the Company s leased systems are treated as sales-type leases under GAAP accounting policies.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Financing receivables are generated by solar energy systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Financing receivables represents gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term of up to 20 years and the systems estimated residual value, net of allowance for estimated losses.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Initial direct costs for sales-type leases are recognized as cost of sales when the solar energy systems are placed in service.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	For systems classified as sales-type leases, the net present value of the minimum lease payments, net of executory costs, is recognized as revenue when the lease is placed in service.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	This net present value as well as the net present value of the residual value of the lease at termination are recorded as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	The difference between the initial net amounts and the gross amounts are amortized to revenue over the lease term using the interest method.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The residual values of the Company s solar energy systems are determined at the inception of the lease applying an estimated system fair value at the end of the lease term.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	RGS considers the credit risk profile for its lease customers to be homogeneous due to the criteria the Company uses to approve customers for its residential leasing program, which among other things, requires a minimum fair FICO credit quality.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Accordingly, the Company does not regularly categorize its financing receivables by credit risk.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	On January 26, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment , which was issued to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	Impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance remains largely unchanged.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017, and the Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-20 ( ASU 2016-20 ), Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1425565_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	This ASU provides technical corrections and improvements to Topic 606.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	This ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, which coincides with the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
1425565_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company is assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18 ( ASU 2016-18 ), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which was issued to address the diversity that currently exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts general described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P77_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2016-18 on its consolidated statements of cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which was issued to provide clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are reported in the statement of cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce existing diversity between companies.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P78_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated statements of cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ), Simplifying Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which was issued to simplify some of the accounting guidance for share-based compensation.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Among the areas impacted by the amendments in this ASU is the accounting for income taxes related to share-based payments, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	The Company expects to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2017.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S4	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S5	The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S6	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P80_S7	The Company currently expects that upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, lease liabilities will be recognized in the balance sheet in amounts that will be material.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05 ( ASU 2015-05 ), Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement , which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company has adopted this ASU using a prospective approach.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P81_S3	It did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 ( ASU 2015-03 ), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	The new standard is applied on a retrospective basis.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company has adopted ASU 2015-03 and the convertible debt under the Notes is presented net of discount and issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ), Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Under GAAP, financial statements are prepared with the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Currently, GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2014-15 provides guidance to an organization s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the Company for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted for unissued financial statements.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	The Company has adopted this ASU, and has determined there is no impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which created Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers .
1425565_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The core principle of the revenue model is that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	Transfer of control is not the same as transfer of risks and rewards, as it is considered in current guidance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 one year.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	ASU 2014-09, as deferred by ASU 2015-14, will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, using either of two methods: (a) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (b) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined in ASU 2014-09.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Company has implemented a plan that will involve internal meetings to review the new standard, and determine which transition method to utilize.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P91_S3	This plan is expected to be executed during the 2 nd quarter of 2017.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	On January 19, 2016, the Company entered into a waiver and consent agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) in which it consented to the assignment of the revolving credit facility to Solar Solutions and Distribution, LLC ( Solar Solutions ) and waived any claims against SVB.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	On January 19, 2016, Solar Solutions acquired the revolving credit facility from SVB.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P93_S2	Subsequently on March 30, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with Solar Solutions (the Loan ) which, among other items, (i) extended the term to March 31, 2017, (ii) allowed for certain eligible inventories to be included in the borrowing base and (iii) required the Company to enter a master supply agreement for a period of two years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	Generally, the Loan provides for advances at pre-defined advance rates against inventory and accounts receivable and a variable rate of eligible inventory as defined in the Loan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	The maximum amount of the Loan before its termination was $3.0 million (it was automatically reduced to $3.0 million on January 1, 2017 pursuant to the terms of the Loan).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	Borrowings bore, and accrued interest at the greater of (a) the greater of the prime rate or 4.0%, plus 3.0%, and (b) 7.0%.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P94_S3	The amended maturity date for the Loan was March 31, 2017.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	The line of credit had a facility fee of 2.0% per year of the average daily unused portion of the available line of credit and a loan administration and collateral monitoring labor fee of $4,000 per month.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	On May 25, 2016, the Company entered into the First Loan Modification Agreement, effective as of May 19, 2016, with Solar Solutions to amend the Loan to, among other things, (i) reschedule the payment of $167,513.41 due on May 15, 2016 to a date on or before June 3, 2016 and (ii) require the Company to issue to Solar Solutions 969 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $5.76 per share as a payment on the revolving line of credit under the Loan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	Furthermore, on August 22, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Loan Modification Agreement, effective as of August 19, 2016, with Solar Solutions to modify the definition of eligible accounts receivable for purposes of the borrowing base calculation, thereby increasing the collateral calculation and availability under the Loan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P96_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a line of credit balance of $0.7 million and $0.8 million with Solar Solutions and SVB, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	As a result of the capital raises in September and in the fourth quarter of 2016, the last time the Company submitted a request to borrow funds from Solar Solutions for working capital was September 28, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	Since that time, the line of credit activity included (i) increases for material purchases, (ii) increases for fees as called for in the Loan, and (iii) reductions attributable to the sweep of daily cash receipts.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	On January 11, 2017, the Company became a creditor of Solar Solutions as the daily sweep of cash receipts exceeded material purchases and fees.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P97_S3	On February 6, 2017, the Company issued a 3-day notice of termination, causing the Loan to be terminated as of February 9, 2017.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P97_S4	Additionally, the Company had an Exclusive Supply Agreement ( Supply Agreement ) with Solar Solutions which was terminated as of the same date, as the term of the Supply Agreement was coterminous with the Loan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	On June 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Conversion Agreement (the Conversion Agreement ) with Riverside Fund III, L.P. ( Riverside Lender ), an entity affiliated with Riverside (David Belluck, Director of RGS, who is a General Partner of Riverside) Partners, LLC), to convert notes payable with a principal balance of $3.15 million plus accrued interest of $1.1 million into 2,147 shares of the Company s Class A common stock using a conversion ratio equal to $1,974.00 per share; the closing price of the Class A common stock on June 23, 2015 (the Conversion ).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	The Company subsequently issued shares of Class A common stock to Riverside in full satisfaction of the outstanding principal and accrued interest.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company leases office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from one month to five years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company leases vehicles through operating leases for certain field personnel.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Leases range up to five years with varying termination dates through August 2020.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The following schedule represents the annual future minimum payments of all leases as of December 31, 2016:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company incurred office and warehouse rent expense of $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and the seasonal nature of its business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Company has accrued for probable and estimable costs incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings that is considered to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting certain information pertaining to the Company s July 9, 2014 private placement offering of $7.0 million of its class A common stock and warrants (the 2014 PIPE Offering ).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company established a special committee of the board of directors to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the 2014 PIPE offering and engaged outside counsel to assist it with its review.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	On May 11, 2016, the Company was advised by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Staff ) that the Staff did not intend to recommend any enforcement action against the Company with respect to the investigation commenced by the Staff in June 2015.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S3	The Company incurred $1.5 million of associated legal expenses related to the subpoena.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S4	The Company and its legal advisors believe its expenses in responding to the subpoena should be fully paid by its insurance carrier as they are directly related to the 2014 PIPE offering.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S5	In March 2016, the insurance carrier agreed to pay amounts it believed to constitute defense costs, while reserving all rights, including the right to recoup all amounts paid.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P105_S6	The Company has recorded a long-term liability for amounts advanced by the insurance carrier of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	On November 22, 2016, the Company provided the remaining cash collateral to Argonaut Insurance Company to fully secure the full amount of the $624,000 Final Acceptance Payment and Performance Bond for a large commercial photovoltaic project the Company s subsidiary Regrid Power, Inc. completed in 2012.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	As previously disclosed, the customer has raised warranty claims pertaining to the project and the Company currently maintains a specific warranty liability for the project of approximately $200,000.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	On November 30, 2016, the Company received a letter from the customer in which the customer alleged that the Company has not completed agreed-upon remedial work to remedy alleged deficiencies and notified the Company that the customer intends to perform such remedial work at the Company s expense using a third-party contractor.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S3	The customer also requested that the owner of the project demand the full amount of the performance bond.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S4	In addition, the customer demanded an aggregate of approximately $400,000 as liquidated damages under the terms of the project contract.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S5	The Company denies these assertions and disputes that the customer is entitled to liquidated damages.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S6	The Company plans to avail itself of all defenses and remedies available.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S7	The Company estimates that the range of loss related to this warranty claim is from approximately $200,000 to a maximum of approximately $1 million.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P106_S8	The Company has recorded a liability for the minimum amount of the range of loss.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	On April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement of $10.0 million units, each consisting of a Note and one Series G warrant to purchase a fraction of one share of Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	On the same day the Company closed the transaction and issued an aggregate of $10.0 million of Notes and Series G warrants exercisable into 8,299 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	In accordance with relevant accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options, the Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of the Notes by allocating the proceeds between the liability component, and equity component over their relative fair values after initially allocating the fair value of the embedded conversion option.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	The equity component of the Notes and the embedded derivative liability are recognized as a debt discount on the issuance date.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	The debt discount, is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over three years, or the life of the Notes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company classifies the embedded derivative liabilities related to the Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Derivative liabilities, which are revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to their initial issuance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	The Company used a Monte Carlo pricing model to value these derivative liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Monte Carlo pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company used 10,000 simulations in the Monte Carlo pricing model to value the embedded derivative in the Notes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	If factors change and different assumptions are used, the derivative liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in fair value of derivative liabilities and loss on debt extinguishment, with an offsetting non-cash entry recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	The following table reflects original assumptions at April 1, 2016 and at December 31, 2016 for embedded derivative liabilities issued in the 2016 Note Offering, closing market price adjusted to reflect the one-for-twenty reverse stock split on June 2, 2016 and one-for-thirty reverse stock split on January 26, 2017:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company incurred approximately $1.4 million of debt issuance costs, which primarily consisted of underwriting commissions and warrants, and legal and other professional fees, and allocated these costs to the liability component of the host debt instrument, and is recorded as a contra account to the debt liability on the balance sheet.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The amount allocated to the liability component is amortized to interest expense over the contractual life of the Notes using the effective interest method.

1425565_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	At December 31, 2016, RGS had the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P136_S2	FASB ASC No. 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures- Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 820-10-35 ), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P136_S3	ASC 820-10-35-3 also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P136_S4	Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	ASC 820-10-35 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
1425565_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	The statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P137_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Level 1 Inputs Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	An active market is a market in which transactions occur for the item to be fair valued with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	Level 2 Inputs Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	Level 2 inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	These inputs include: (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, such as when there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially over time or in which little information is released publicly; (c) Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and (d) Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Level 3 Inputs Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	These inputs should be used to determine fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P141_S2	Unobservable inputs should be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include internally generated data and assumptions being used to price the asset or liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	For the Company s Level 3 measures, which represent common stock warrants, fair value is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model that is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company used a market approach to valuing these derivative liabilities.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning to the ending balance for the Company s common stock warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (i.e. Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2016:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company s 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provided that an aggregate of 52,536 shares of its Class A common stock may be awarded under the plan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P148_S2	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, service providers and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	Options vest based on service conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P150_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in RGS industry and its stock price volatility since the Company s initial public offering.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P153_S1	RGS does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	RGS is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	RGS primarily uses plan life-to-date forfeiture experience rate to estimate option forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following are the variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair value for options granted under the Company s incentive plans for each of the years presented:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	The table below presents a summary of the Company s option activity as of December 31, 2016 and changes during the years then ended:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	The total fair value of shares vested was approximately $1,000 and $780,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	The Company s share-based compensation cost charged against income for continuing operations was approximately $0.7 million and $0.8 million during the years 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P157_S2	As of December 31, 2016, there was $0.2 million of unrecognized cost related to non-vested shared-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P157_S3	The Company expects that cost to be recognized over the next fiscal year.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company s provision for income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets shown on a gross basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
1425565_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	At December 31, 2016, RGS had $122.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring, if not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	Additionally, the Company had $109.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring, it not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitation under applicable federal and state ownership change limitations and, accordingly, net operating losses may expire before utilization.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis through December 2016 and therefore has not determined the impact of any ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred in prior years.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P162_S2	Therefore, the net operating loss carryforwards above do not reflect any possible limitations and potential loss attributes to such ownership changes.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P162_S3	However, the Company believes that upon completion of a Section 382 analysis, as a result of prior period ownership changes, substantially all of the net operating losses will be subject to limitation.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The Company s valuation allowance decreased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of its operating loss for the year.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P163_S2	Based upon the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1425565_17_ITEM8_P163_S3	At December 31, 2016, the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected taxable income from the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities.

1425565_17_ITEM11_P10_S0	In fiscal 2016, our named executive officers were eligible to receive the same health care coverage that was generally available to our other employees.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P10_S1	Our benefit programs include medical, dental and vision insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, business travel insurance, wellness programs (including chiropractic, massage therapy, acupuncture, and fitness classes), relocation/expatriate programs and services, educational assistance, and certain other benefits.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P11_S0	Our compensation committee believes that our 401(k) Plan and the other generally available benefit programs allow us to remain competitive for employee talent, and that the availability of the benefit programs generally enhances employee productivity and loyalty to us.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P11_S1	The main objectives of our benefits programs are to give our employees access to quality healthcare, financial protection from unforeseen events, assistance in achieving retirement financial goals, and enhanced health and productivity, in full compliance with applicable legal requirements.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P11_S2	Typically, these generally available benefits do not specifically factor into decisions regarding an individual executive officer s total compensation or 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan award package.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our compensation committee administers and grants awards under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and has granted to our chief executive officer the authority to make awards to our employees that do not report directly to the chief executive officer.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P12_S1	During fiscal 2016, our chief executive officer, compensation committee and board of directors consistently applied the following guidelines for stock option grant timing practices:
1425565_17_ITEM11_P13_S0	New Employees : stock option grants to new hires are effective on the first day of the new employee s employment with us or upon approval by our chief executive officer, compensation committee or board of directors, as applicable, and the exercise price for the options is set at the closing price of our Class A common stock on that date.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P14_S0	Existing Employees : stock option grants to existing employees are effective on the date that our chief executive officer, compensation committee or board of directors, as applicable, approves the grant, and the exercise price for the options is set at the closing price of our Class A common stock on that date.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P15_S0	Our standard form of stock option agreement provides that option vesting ceases upon termination of employment.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P15_S1	A former employee may exercise vested options (i) within 30 days (generally), (ii) within three months (upon retirement at or after normal retirement age) or (iii) within one year (upon termination due to death or disability or (iv)within one year (after a change of control) after termination, but in no event after the expiration term of the applicable option.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P15_S2	Additionally, 100% of unvested options immediately vest upon the occurrence of a change of control.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P16_S0	In designing our compensation programs, we take into consideration the accounting and tax effect that each element will or may have on us and our executive officers and other employees.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P16_S1	We aim to keep the expense related to our compensation programs as a whole within certain affordability levels.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P16_S2	When determining how to apportion between differing elements of compensation, our goal is to meet our objectives while maintaining relative cost neutrality.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P16_S3	For instance, if we increase benefits under one program resulting in higher compensation expense, we may seek to decrease costs under another program in order to avoid a compensation expense that is above the level then deemed affordable under existing circumstances.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P17_S0	For options, we recognize a charge to earnings for accounting purposes equally from the grant date until the end of the vesting period.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P18_S0	We believe we have structured our compensation program to comply with Internal Revenue Code Sections 162(m) and 409A.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P19_S0	Under Section 162(m), a limitation is placed on tax deductions of any publicly-held corporation for individual compensation to certain executives of such corporation exceeding $1 million in any taxable year, unless the compensation is performance-based.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P19_S1	If an executive is entitled to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are subject to Section 409A, and such benefits do not comply with Section 409A, then the benefits are taxable in the first year they are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P19_S2	In such case, the service provider is subject to regular federal income tax, interest and an additional federal income tax of 20% of the benefit includible in income.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P20_S0	We do not believe we have individuals with non-performance based compensation paid in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) tax deduction limit.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P21_S0	During 2016, directors who were not employees of our company or its affiliates were paid an annual retainer of $20,000 plus fees of $1,000 for each in-person board meeting attended, $200 for each telephonic board meeting attended, $500 for each committee meeting attended and $200 for each telephonic committee meeting attended.
1425565_17_ITEM11_P21_S1	Members of each standing committee receive an annual fee of $4,000 and chairpersons of each standing committee receive an annual fee of $10,000.

1425565_17_ITEM13_P12_S5	During 2016 and January 2017, we repaid in full all amounts owed to the Empery Funds and Alto under their notes by converting such amounts into shares of our Class A common stock, approximately $1.5 million and $2.5 million in principal, respectively, and approximately $62,000 and $124,000 in accrued interest.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P13_S0	(the 20% Rule ), which required a company whose securities are traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market to obtain shareholder approval before the sale, issuance or potential issuance (including upon conversion or exercise of securities) of common stock equal to 20% or more of the common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance for less than the greater of book or market value of the stock.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P13_S1	With respect to the Notes, the 20% threshold and book and market value of our Class A common stock was measured as of April 1, 2016.

1425565_17_ITEM13_P14_S2	Empery and Alto are no longer a related person of RGS.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P15_S0	Any related-party transaction is reviewed by disinterested members of management and, if material, by disinterested members of our board of directors or a committee thereof to ensure that the transaction reflects terms that are at least as favorable for us as we would expect in a similar transaction negotiated at arm s length by unrelated parties.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P16_S0	Our board of directors currently consists of six members and meets regularly during the year.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P16_S1	Our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Belluck, Bouska, Bowles, Schaeffer and Scott are independent as defined by the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
1425565_17_ITEM13_P16_S2	Membership on our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee is limited to independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P0_S0	Effective April 12, 2016, our audit committee approved a resolution to retain Hein Associates LLP as our independent accountants to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P1_S0	The following table presents fees billed for professional accounting fees and services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 from our principal accounting firm Hein Associates:
1425565_17_ITEM14_P2_S0	(1) Audit fees are fees that were charged for the audit of our annual financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K and review of unaudited financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; for services that are normally provided by the auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements; and all costs and expenses in connection with the above.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P3_S0	(2) Audit related fees consisted of accounting consultations and additional audit procedures in connection with a business acquisition and related filings.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P4_S0	(3) Tax fees represent tax advice and tax compliance services primarily in connection with a business acquisition and other transactions.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P5_S0	In accordance with the policies of our audit committee and legal requirements, all services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm are pre-approved by our audit committee.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P5_S1	For 2016, our audit committee pre-approved all such services.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P5_S2	Pre-approved services include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P5_S3	In some cases, pre-approval is provided by the full audit committee for up to one year, and such services relate to a particular defined task or scope of work and are subject to a specific budget.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P5_S4	In other cases, the chairperson of our audit committee has the delegated authority from our audit committee to pre-approve additional services, and such action is then communicated to the full audit committee at the next audit committee meeting.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P6_S0	To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the law prohibits a publicly traded company from obtaining certain non-audit services from its auditing firm.
1425565_17_ITEM14_P6_S1	If we need such services, we obtain them from other service providers.
1425565_17_ITEM15_P0_S0	Documents filed as part of this report are as follows:
1425565_17_ITEM15_P1_S0	See listing of Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Form 10-K in Item 8 of Part II.
1425565_17_ITEM15_P2_S0	The following exhibits are incorporated by reference into or are filed or furnished with this report as indicated below:
1425565_17_ITEM15_P3_S0	* Indicates management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	RGS Energy and its subsidiaries ( RGS , we, us, or the Company ) provide solar energy systems to homeowners, and commercial building owners in the United States.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	We believe that solar energy adoption is still in the early stages and will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	RGS and our predecessors have installed over 26,000 solar energy systems across the continental United States and Hawaii since 1978.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	We endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our customers by managing and executing the process with our sales and installation teams.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	We design and offer a suitable solar energy solution, then procure, permit, install, and interconnect the system to the utility grid.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	We provide a comprehensive workmanship warranty on each fully operational system.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	On September 29, 2017 we executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide Technology License Agreement (the License ) with Dow Global Technologies LLC ( Dow ) for its POWERHOUSE in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	The POWERHOUSE 1.0 and 2.0 versions used CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide solar cells) technology which had a high manufacturing cost, resulting in the product not being consumer price friendly.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	Conversely, the POWERHOUSE 3.0 is being developed with traditional silicon solar cells to increase solar production and to provide a competitive consumer price point.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	Under terms of the License, we are pursuing final stages of development of the POWERHOUSE 3.0 to receive UL Certification, after which we will begin to commercialize the product in North America.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S4	Upon achieving UL Certification, we will engage third-party manufacturers for production and perform distribution logistics and services to the home building and roofing industries.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S5	Further, we plan on engaging in technological advances in panel output and expansion of potential customer base from asphalt shingle roofing to alternative roofing systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P3_S6	Under a Trademark License Agreement with Dow, we will market the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product using the Dow name.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
1425565_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	A description about our operating segments and the financial information about our segments may be found in Note 10.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by our representatives.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have a history of operating losses, and we can provide no assurance as to our future operating results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities as of December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Whether we achieve profitability or not will depend on our success in increasing sales and installation revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $3.7 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $200 million.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $17.7 million.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financial statements as of December 31, 2017 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2017 financial statements, in their report, included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses and expressed substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, increase sales and installations, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We need to increase our sales, installations and revenue in order to achieve our goal of initially operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our current levels of sales, installations and revenue are insufficient for profitable operations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The additional financial resources obtained in February 2017 allowed us to develop and initiate implementation of a revenue growth strategy to increase sales and installation revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we are unsuccessful in executing these plans, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even, and profitability thereafter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We need to continue to grow our backlog or we will be unable to increase revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	To grow our backlog, we hired and trained new salespersons, and bid upon new customer sales which were ultimately awarded.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	While we continue to implement our revenue growth strategy, until we build a larger backlog, our installation revenue will fluctuate by quarter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we are unsuccessful in building a larger backlog, we will be unable to increase sales, installations and resulting revenue and we will not achieve our goal of operating at break-even and achieving profitability thereafter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have a history of negative cash flows from operations, and it is uncertain when, or if, in the future we will be able to achieve or sustain positive cash flow from operations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There can be no assurance in the future that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain funds from future financings or other sources to fund operations or other liquidity needs which could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our future operating performance and our ability to service indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our indebtedness imposes customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The restrictions imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt would likely be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under applicable indebtedness if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such indebtedness.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Existing rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering , which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In some states, net metering is being replaced with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems and deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require the price of solar energy systems to be reduced in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	U.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	For example, The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	DOER s new program, SMART is expected to launch in the summer of 2018, and has announced that the SREC II program would be extended until the SMART program begins in order to bridge between the two programs.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Existing regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	An increase in our cost of materials could arise as a result of the United States imposing trade remedies on imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In April 2017, Suniva, a US-based manufacturer of solar panels in bankruptcy, filed a safeguard petition under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 requesting that the ITC recommend the President impose trade remedies on imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules in the form of an initial duty rate on imported solar cells of $0.40/watt and an initial minimum price on imported solar modules of $0.78/watt.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	On January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States approved in substantial form, recommendations by the ITC to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff are applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade Act.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In response to the 201 Tariff, we entered into a purchase commitment for solar panels on a semi-annual basis to maintain a consistent price for imported solar panels.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If the tariff increases the cost of materials and pricing to a level that causes a reduction in the number of customer installations, it may negatively impact our revenue and profit margin.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	On March 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States signed a memorandum in regard to imposing new tariffs based on the findings of an investigation by the United States Trade Representative in Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The investigation was focused on trade practices with China and the President has instructed the United States Trade Representative to publish a list of proposed Chinese goods that could be subject to tariffs within 15 days of signing the memorandum.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The tariffs are expected to affect about 1,300 lines of the harmonized tariff code, but they will not be imposed until after a 60-day notice and comment period after which the final list of goods will be identified.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Currently the majority of products for our solar division are procured from regions other than China.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our current manufacturing plan for POWERHOUSE does include goods that will be made in China and may be affected by newly imposed tariffs, however we have incorporated an additional 30% tariff into our models should additional tariffs be placed on POWERHOUSE products.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Although currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted solar companies such as us.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Shortages in the supply of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Shortages of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Manufacturers of photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in photovoltaic modules.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	A significant percentage of photovoltaic modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2017 were sourced from North American manufacturers, we have experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business .
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	For installation projects where we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	For projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis, our revenue from these installations is determined by the performance of our contractual obligations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Although we generally have payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We experience spikes in orders during the spring and summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the summer and fall.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and whether customers are looking to take advantage of such incentives before the end of the year.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our ability to construct systems outdoors may be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flow.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The solar energy industry is subject to technological change.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If we rely on products and technologies that cease to be attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function or quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may incur fines and other penalties if we do not conduct our business in accordance with licenses required for our operations and if any such license is suspended or lost, we may be unable to sell or install solar energy systems in the jurisdiction in question and our sales and revenue from that jurisdiction would be adversely affected.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As a construction company, we are required to hold general or specialty contractors licenses in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, although in other jurisdictions we are permitted to utilize the licenses of subcontractors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Some jurisdictions also require licenses to sell home improvement products or services, or to issue consumer credit.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	If we violate the rules of these licensing authorities, we may incur fines or other penalties or have our licenses suspended or cancelled.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Some licenses require us to employ personnel with specific qualifications.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If we lose those personnel, we may lose our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction until we can hire a qualified replacement.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We have not paid bonuses in over two years and have not had a significant amount of employee stock options or other equity incentive awards available to issue as incentive compensation to our senior executives, management team and employees.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If we are unable to pay bonuses or issue stock options or other equity incentive awards in the future, we may lose the services of members of our management team or other key personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Further, we do not carry key man life insurance on our executives.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P55_S6	In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract additional qualified senior executive, management and key personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The loss of personnel or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The expansion of our business could significantly strain our managerial, financial and personnel resources.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defective workmanship.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Although we maintain an estimated liability for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our recorded liability could adversely affect our operating results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	From time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	From time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment, the ultimate resolution of which could have a material impact upon our results of operations and financial position.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	As previously disclosed, and as discussed in Item 3 of Part I, we have a dispute with a customer of our former Commercial segment wherein the customer alleges that we have not completed agreed-upon remedial work to remedy alleged deficiencies, and has notified us that the customer intends to perform such work at our expense using a third-party contractor.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, the customer demanded an aggregate of approximately $0.4 million as liquidated damages under the terms of the project contract.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We estimate that the range of loss related to this warranty claim is from approximately $0.2 million to a maximum of approximately $0.6 million, resulting in our having previously recorded a $0.2 million, the low end of the range.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Additionally, we have approximately $0.6 million held in escrow related to this matter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If we have to compensate the customer for its remedial work or pay the customer liquidated damages, it would negatively impact our results of operations to the extent such costs exceed the previously recorded liability, and result in a significant use of cash.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The ultimate resolution of our dispute with our insurance carrier could result in the significant outlay of cash.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	As previously disclosed, and as discussed in Item 3 of Part I, we have incurred legal expenses of $1.5 million in connection with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into our July 2014 private placement.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The investigation was ultimately closed without action by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, and we and our legal advisors believe the legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation should be fully paid by our insurance carrier.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Our insurance carrier has paid these legal expenses but informed us that if it concludes that such expenses do not constitute a claim covered by the policy, they would seek to recoup all amounts advanced.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	As such, we have recorded the advanced funds as a deferred liability.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	If our insurance carrier were to pursue reimbursement and prevailed in recouping the amounts advanced, it would not affect results of operations but would result in a significant use of cash.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers, installers and other vendors, and if these companies were unable to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Factors that may prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget include:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Because the legacy solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	access to materials, labor and installation services.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Competition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Solar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and maintain insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Availability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Many of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price of our solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Third-party financing sources may also charge significant fees for their financing products.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S4	In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P81_S5	However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance most of our sales of solar energy systems.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	An increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Some of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Third-party financing sources, specifically for solar energy systems, are currently limited.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P83_S2	The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit, or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or too costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our license with Dow Global Technologies LLC for the exclusive use of the POWERHOUSE trademark name is subject to obtaining UL certification and thereafter, successful commercialization of the POWERHOUSE 3.0 in-roof shingle.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded an intangible asset of $1 million for the initial up-front license payment to Dow Global Technologies LLC.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Upon obtaining UL Certification, assuming we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, we will incur a liability of $2 million for further up-front license payments that will be recorded as an addition to the intangible asset.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we do not obtain UL Certification by September 2019, the licensor has the right to amend the license to be non-exclusive.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Recoverability of the intangible asset is dependent upon successful commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0 and will require us to obtain additional capital, manage a supply chain to manufacture the product and expand our operations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	If we are unable to successfully commercialize the POWERHOUSE 3.0 shingle, the related intangible asset will become impaired.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We may be unable to successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE 3.0, which may negatively impact our business and results of operation.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	There are risks we must address to successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE 3.0:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Competition in the built-in photovoltaic solar system business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	No assurances can be given: (i) that we will receive UL certification, (ii) for the timing of receiving UL certification, (iii) for the timing of commencement of POWERHOUSE 3.0 sales, and (iv) whether we can successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE 3.0.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers homes and businesses, could give rise to claims against us.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	As a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P94_S3	The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We rely on technology, computer systems, third-party service providers, and our website for obtaining and storing certain information.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Our business requires us to receive, retain and transmit personally identifiable information and other information about our customers, suppliers and employees, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and other businesses we interact with.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyber-attack, computer malware or viruses, employee error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement (including so-called social engineering attacks and phishing scams) or other acts.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Costs associated with our past security breach have not been significant.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Unauthorized parties have previously obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers, suppliers or employees or may otherwise cause damage or interfere with our technology, computer systems or website.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S4	We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, privacy and information security regulations change, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P97_S5	We have taken, and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such information and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but there can be no assurance that our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with will not be compromised, and such compromise could result in such information being obtained by unauthorized persons, adverse operational effects or interruptions, substantial additional costs or being subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could damage our reputation in the marketplace or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	In the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Capital Market independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the Nasdaq Capital Market s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Further, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of compensation to our executive officers.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P100_S1	In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet Nasdaq s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Future volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock could result in substantial losses for investors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the 2018 Notes and exercise of outstanding warrants could substantially dilute your investment and could impede our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The 2018 Notes will be convertible into, and our outstanding warrants are exercisable for shares of our Class A common stock and give the holders an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Conversion or exercise thereof will result in dilution of the equity interests of our shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S2	In particular, we have agreed with the parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement for the 2018 Offering to have our shareholders vote for approval of a decrease in the conversion price and exercise price of the 2018 Notes and Series Q warrants to be issued in the 2018 Offering, which could result in downward pressure on the price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Further, the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, in payment of principal and/or interest on the 2018 Notes, will result in dilution of the equity interests of our other shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S4	We have no control over whether the holders will exercise their right to convert their Notes or exercise their warrants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S5	We cannot predict the market price of our Class A common stock at any future date, and therefore, cannot predict the applicable prices at which the 2018 Notes may be converted or outstanding warrants may be exercised.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S6	For these reasons, we are unable to accurately forecast or predict with any certainty the total amount of shares that may be issued under the 2018 Notes and outstanding warrants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S7	However, we have estimated the number of Class A common stock that may ultimately be issued under the 2018 Notes to be approximately 18 million shares and under outstanding warrants (assuming that only warrants with an exercise price at or below $3.10 will be exercised) to be approximately 7.0 million shares.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P106_S8	The actual number of shares to be issued cannot be precisely determined.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	If our shareholders do not vote in favor to allow us to issue shares of Class A common stock below market price under our 2018 Notes and Series Q warrants, we may not receive cash payment under the Investor Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The terms of our 2018 Notes and Series Q warrants provide for reduction of the conversion price and exercise price, as applicable, upon the occurrence of certain events.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Under applicable Nasdaq rules, we are not permitted to issue shares upon the conversion of the 2018 Notes or exercise of the Series Q warrants at a price below the market price of our Class A common stock at the time we entered into the transaction documents for the 2018 Offering unless we first obtain shareholder approval.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The transaction documents for the 2018 Offering require us to seek shareholder approval to allow such reduction.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P108_S3	If our shareholders do not vote to approve such reduction, we will not be able to require the investors in the 2018 Offering to prepay their Investor Notes and will not receive any of the $5 million principal amount of the Investor Notes unless the investors voluntarily agree to prepay.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, it will require additional capital which could be met from the Investor Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P109_S1	In the event capital from the Investor Notes are not received, we would seek obtaining the capital from other transactions such as a public offering of securities, and common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of outstanding common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P109_S2	No assurances can be given that, should we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, we will have available to us the necessary capital to do so, whether from the Investor Notes or an alternative transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Should we determine to seek capital from a public offering of securities it will be dilutive to shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	If the holders of the 2018 Notes do not convert their 2018 Notes into shares of Class A common stock and we are unable to force them to convert, we will have a balance outstanding at maturity of the 2018 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The 2018 Notes will be convertible into shares of our Class A common shares.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Holders of our 2018 Notes will be allowed to convert them into shares of Class A common stock at any time.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We also will have the ability to force holders to convert upon the occurrence of a certain event.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P111_S3	However, we do not expect that holders of the 2018 Notes will convert them voluntarily unless the shares they receive upon conversion are either registered for resale under the Securities Act or eligible to be resold under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P111_S4	Further, our ability to force holders of our 2018 Notes to convert them will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	In the event there is a balance outstanding at maturity, we would seek to refinance the remaining balance outstanding at that time from either: (i) refinancing of the obligation with the note holders, (ii) a public offering of securities, or (iii) common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	No assurances can be given that should a balance remain on the 2018 Notes at maturity we will be successful in meeting the obligation under the 2018 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Should we determine to seek capital from a public offering of securities, it will be dilutive to shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Future issuances of stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Ownership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	As of March 30, 2018, there were an aggregate of approximately 10.4 million shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P116_S1	The exercise price under certain of our outstanding warrants is subject to reset in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Further, the exercise price of our Series H warrants is subject to reset at the earlier to occur of (a) the repayment in full of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due April 1, 2019 (the 2016 Notes ), and (b) the maturity date of the 2016 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P116_S3	If on such date the exercise price of our Series H warrants exceeds 85% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock for the five trading days ending on, but including, the adjustment date, the exercise price will be reset to such lower price.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Any determination to pay dividends in the future on our Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Because our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P122_S1	These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P122_S2	As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	A shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	No shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Our board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P128_S1	The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Our board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P130_S0	The terms of the 2018 Notes, our outstanding warrants and certain transaction documents we have entered into with investors participating in our past offerings could impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing and could result in our paying premiums or penalties to the holders of the 2018 Notes and outstanding warrants.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The terms of the 2018 Notes and some of our outstanding series of warrants to purchase Class A common stock prohibit us from entering into a fundamental transaction (as defined in the 2018 Notes and such warrants) (including generally, a merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or permitting a purchase tender or exchange offering resulting in a person or group of persons owning at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock) unless, among other things, the successor resulting from the fundamental transaction assumes all of our obligations under the 2018 Notes, the applicable warrants and the associated transaction documents.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P131_S1	The terms of the transaction documents we have entered into with investors participating in our past offerings also contain restrictions on our ability to conduct future securities offerings and incur additional debt.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Further, the 2018 Notes and our outstanding warrants require us to deliver the number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise within a specified time period.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P132_S1	If we are unable to deliver the shares of Class A common stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holder for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the conversion or exercise and sale of such shares.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We may also be obligated to redeem the 2018 Notes at a premium upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the 2018 Notes) or a change of control (as defined in the 2018 Notes).
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Some of our outstanding warrants also contain features that may require us to repurchase such warrants upon the occurring of a change of control.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In addition to the foregoing, we may be obligated to pay cash penalties under the registration rights agreement we have entered into with the investors in the 2018 Offering if, among other things, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not declared effective required registration statements within a specified registration deadline.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P135_S0	As a result, our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing in the future. could be impeded and the payments we may be obligated to make described above may adversely affect our results of operations.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Proxy contests threatened or commenced against us could be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may wage proxy contests or gain representation on our Board of Directors could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Contested elections and responses to activist shareholders can be distracting to management, time consuming and expensive, and can cause the Company s resources and the attention of our management to be diverted.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P137_S1	For example, we incurred approximately $1 million of additional expense in connection with the proxy contest related to our 2017 annual shareholders meeting when compared to an annual meeting with an uncontested director election.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P137_S2	Additionally, activist shareholders may jeopardize our ability to attract qualified board members in the future which may make it difficult to comply with independence standards of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Capital Market, attract new employees, retain current employees, create new vendor alliances, establish favorable credit terms with vendors, and close customer sales in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P138_S0	In addition, with respect to contested shareholders meetings, the rules governing the ability of banks, brokers and other nominees to vote shares for which they have not received voting instructions from beneficial owners make it more difficult to obtain a quorum for the meeting.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P138_S1	For example, we were unable to establish a quorum for its 2017 annual meeting of shareholders until we reached an agreement with the activist shareholders who had filed a competing proxy statement for the meeting.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P138_S2	Failure to obtain a quorum at our shareholders meeting could cause us to be in non-compliance with Nasdaq rules which require us to hold an annual meeting once each fiscal year, and would result in our not being able to obtain shareholder approval of matters we are required to submit to our shareholders for approval, such as amendments to our equity incentive plan, which could have a negative impact on our operations as discussed further in a separate risk factor below.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P138_S3	Further, uncertainty about our future board composition and our ability to obtain shareholder approval when required could negatively impact the market price and volatility of our Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We must meet The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease the per share price of our Class A common stock and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Our Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We must continue to satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We have failed to comply with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements in the past and there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy Nasdaq s minimum shareholders equity requirement or any other applicable listing requirement during the monitoring period or thereafter.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P142_S0	If our Class A common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P142_S1	In such case, our shareholders ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P142_S2	These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P143_S0	In addition to the foregoing, if our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P144_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P144_S1	The last reported trade of our Company Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was at a price below $5.00 per share.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P144_S2	If our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our Class A common stock would be considered a penny stock.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P145_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P145_S1	The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P145_S2	In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s agreement to the transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM1A_P145_S3	If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our Class A common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our Class A common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.
1425565_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal executive offices are located in Denver, Colorado.
1425565_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The following table sets forth certain information relating to our primary facilities:
1425565_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Existing facilities have lease renewal options ranging from 1 month to 5 years.
1425565_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that we consider to be in the normal course of business.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol RGSE.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 30, 2018, we had 97 shareholders of record and 10,351,845 shares of $.0001 par value Class A common stock and no shares of $.0001 par value Class B common stock outstanding.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low close prices for our Class A common stock for the periods indicated:
1425565_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to operate our business and support our future growth strategies.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay dividends on our Class A common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	In addition, the terms of our 2016 Notes and 2018 Notes prohibit us from making any dividend payment until all of the 2016 Notes and 2018 Notes have been converted, redeemed, or otherwise satisfied.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017, we issued an aggregate of 160,185 shares of Class A common stock to the holders of the 2016 Notes as payment of an aggregate of $0.5 million of principal and interest owed under the 2016 Notes at a per share price of $2.82.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	As previously reported, the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon repayment of principal and interest and upon conversion of the 2016 Notes was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the Securities Act ) Section 4(a)(2) and Securities Act Rule 506(b).
1425565_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	The holders of the 2016 Notes are sophisticated, accredited investors and acquired the 2016 Notes for their own accounts for investment purposes.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	Further, the transaction documents pursuant to which the holders purchased the 2016 Notes state that the securities in question have not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold or otherwise transferred without registration or an exemption therefrom and provide for the placement of a restrictive legend on any stock certificates issued upon conversion of the 2016 Notes, subject to the terms of the transaction documents.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	All other sales of equity securities during 2017 were registered and have been previously reported in Current Reports on Form 8-K.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	See section entitled Equity Compensation Plan Information in Item 12.
1425565_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a residential and small business commercial solar energy engineering, procurement and construction firm.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	We offer turnkey services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out, grid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our solar energy systems use high-quality solar photovoltaic modules.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	We use proven technologies and techniques to help customers achieve meaningful savings by reducing their utility costs.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, we help customers lower their reliance upon fossil fuel energy sources.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	As of September 29, 2017, we are the exclusive domestic and international licensee of POWERHOUSE in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We, including our predecessors, have more than 39 years of experience in residential solar energy and trace our roots to 1978, when Real Goods Trading Corporation sold the first solar photovoltaic panels in the United States.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We have designed and installed over 26,000 residential and commercial solar energy systems since our founding.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	During 2014, we discontinued our entire former Commercial segment and sold the assets associated with our catalog business (a portion of the Other segment).
1425565_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	As of September 30, 2017, we created a new segment for our POWERHOUSE business.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a result, we now operate as four reportable segments: (1) Residential the installation of solar energy systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and small business commercial in the continental United States; (2) Sunetric the installation of solar energy systems for both homeowners and business owners (commercial) in Hawaii; (3) POWERHOUSE - the manufacturing and sales of solar shingles; and (4) Other corporate operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	We believe this structure enables us to more effectively manage our operations and resources.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to our customers when we install the solar energy system.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our business requires that we incur costs of acquiring solar panels and labor to install solar energy systems on our customer rooftops up-front and receive cash from customers thereafter.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	As a result, during periods when we are increasing sales, we expect to have negative cash flow from operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	A material significant event occurred on September 29, 2017 (the Effective Date ), when we executed the License with Dow, providing an exclusive domestic and international right to commercialize its POWERHOUSE in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The POWERHOUSE 1.0 and 2.0 versions used CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide solar cells) technology which had a high manufacturing cost, resulting in the product not being consumer price friendly.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Conversely, the POWERHOUSE 3.0 is being developed with traditional silicon solar cells to increase solar production and to provide a competitive consumer price point.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The License requires us to commercialize and sell a minimum of 50 megawatts of solar within 5-years of the Effective Date to retain exclusive world-wide rights, a requirement we believe is achievable.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	In addition to the License, we executed a Trademark License Agreement (the TLA ), a Technology Service Agreement (the TSA ) and a Sales Agreement-Surplus Property (the Sales Agreement ) with Dow.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The execution of the TLA will allow us to market the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product using the Dow name.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Sales Agreement identified used manufacturing molds that Dow transferred title to us for a cost of $1.00.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Under the terms of the License, we will produce, market and sell POWERHOUSE 3.0, for which we have agreed to a license fee of $3 million and a running royalty fee equal to 2.5% against net sales of the POWERHOUSE product and services, payable quarterly in arrears.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Further, we will be responsible for all post-Effective Date costs to obtain UL Certification and for the prosecution of all related patents world-wide, which may be offset against the payment of the running royalty fee.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	The license fee is comprised of two payments; the first $1 million was paid within 10 days of the Effective Date of the License in 2017 in accordance with the TLA.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The remaining $2 million is due within 30 days of the Company receiving UL Certification of the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Upon obtaining UL Certification, we intend to begin commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0 entailing the manufacturing, marketing and sale of POWERHOUSE 3.0 to roofing companies.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we have invested approximately $1.1 million that has been capitalized to the POWERHOUSE License, an intangible asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Backlog is discussed below and an important metric as we implement our revenue growth strategy.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We utilize a job costing system whereby employees record their time to projects.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	We accumulate the cost of idle time reflecting the cost we incur to maintain a construction organization until our revenue grows, allowing for greater utilization of our construction organization.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Cost of goods sold ( COGS ) include direct project installation costs (materials, labor, travel, financing fees, and estimated warranty costs) and indirect costs for project installation support (including un-utilized labor of idle time of construction crews, supplies, and insurance).
1425565_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We employ an internal time reporting system to determine COGS and resulting gross margin percentage used by the company to measure its performance in achieving gross margin percentage targets.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Further, we measure COGS per watt based upon COGS, excluding idle time, divided by the aggregate watts of systems installed during the period.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	For financial reporting purposes, COGS include the idle time of construction crews currently maintained by the company in anticipation of future growth of backlog.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Gross margin percentage on actual installation time is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the competitive landscape, the average selling price per watt ( ASP ) declined at a greater rate than the cost of installation per watt.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Accordingly, our ASP declined 10% resulting in a roughly 6% and 8% decline in gross margin based on actual installation time and including idle time, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	We anticipate an improvement in our gross margin percentage in future periods from increased revenue from our implementation of our revenue growth strategy.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue that may be recognized in the future from signed contracts to install solar energy systems that have not yet been installed without taking into account possible future cancellations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and is not a measure of contract profitability.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	The backlog amounts we disclose are net of cancellations received and include anticipated revenues associated with (i) the original contract amounts, and (ii) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from customers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table summarizes changes to our backlog by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017:
1425565_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have experienced a high level of contract cancellations, which we attribute to (i) the competitive nature of the solar industry wherein customers shop price after signing a contract and exercise their right to cancel during a three day rescission period after we countersign their contract, (ii) customer home s physical condition requires upgrades that they may not be able to afford or reduces their return on investment, (iii) delays to installing their system within their desired timeframe, and (iv) our history of operating losses and resulting declining stock price affecting customer decisions.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	We determined that for optimum internal operations, and customer satisfaction, that a backlog equivalent to a few months of sales is optimal.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We intend to continue the optimization of our e-sales call -center- based sales organization with the goal of increasing our future sales awards, both for our current states of operation and new states where we may operate in future periods.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our customers currently finance their acquisition of solar energy systems using their own cash, or a loan they receive from a financial provider.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	We believe that to be successful in increasing our sales and resultant revenue, we intend to do the following as part of our revenue growth strategy:
1425565_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Expand our network of authorized third-party installers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We compete with larger, better-financed firms for customers, employees, and the services of third party financiers and installers and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in meeting our goals for increasing sales and revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	In conjunction with our plans to position our company for future profitable operations, we have:
1425565_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Entered into an agreement for an up to $10.75 million convertible note and warrant offering in March 2018 to raise approximately up to $9.1 million after costs.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	We will receive gross proceeds of $5.0 million at closing and may receive up to $5.0 million more in the future upon prepayment of the Investor Notes, if any.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	It is our intent to use the proceeds from the 2018 Offering to obtain UL Certification for POWERHOUSE which will then require a $2 million payment to Dow, and (ii) initiate commercialization of POWERHOUSE .
1425565_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Launched a realignment of the Solar Division to reduce fixed cost structure below the gross profit line by 30% as compared to 2017 costs to lower the required amount of future revenue to achieve break-even, or better, operating results in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Raised net proceeds of $1.8 million from offerings of Class A common stock and warrants in January 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	We have identified the following to be critical accounting policies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity, as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kW, residential and small commercial customers , we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Components are principally comprised of photovoltaic panels, inverters, and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We recognize revenue when we install a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	For those systems of 100 kW or greater, commercial customers, we recognize revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We invoice commercial customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	We estimate anticipated losses based on the expected collectability of all of our accounts receivable, which takes into account collection history, the number of days past due, identification of specific customer exposure and current economic trends.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	When we determine a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursue collection of the account, it is written off.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as photovoltaic modules and inverters) located at our warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	We write down discontinued or slow-moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	We warrant solar energy systems sold to customers for up to ten years against defects in installation workmanship.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	We generally provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	We also maintain specific warranty liabilities for large commercial customers included in discontinued operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	We assess the accrued warranty reserve regularly and adjust the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	During the second quarter of 2017, we concluded that it was appropriate to classify items in the statement of operations to conform with operating metrics reported to investors and the manner in which management evaluates financial performance and to classify warranty liability separately as current and non-current liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	Accordingly, we revised the classification of certain items to report items in the statement of operations and balance sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	These changes in classification did not change the previously reported operating income (loss) in the statement of operations, or cash generated (used) from operations in the statement of cash flows, or operating income (loss) for any business segment.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships ), are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	Goodwill and purchased intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Up-front POWERHOUSE 3.0 license payments when incurred, costs to obtain UL Certification and legal costs to acquire the license and protect the underlying patents are initially capitalized and thereafter amortized to operations, upon achieving UL Certification, on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the license through 2034.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We account for complex financial instruments including convertible notes, convertible preferred stock, and warrants under ASC 815 and ASC 480.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We utilize third party appraisers to determine the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	For financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, we defer and amortize to operations costs incurred including the initial fair value of warrants issued and derivative liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	The issuance costs of financial instruments accounted for as equity are charged to additional paid in capital.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The extinguishment of financial instruments accounted for as debt that are extinguished by issuance of common stock are recorded at the fair value of common stock issued at the date of issuance, with any difference from the carrying value of the liability recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We recognize compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	We measure compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition for performance based awards or over a service period for time based awards.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 8.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	Share-Based Compensation in Item 8 of this Annual Report), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P49_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss carry-forward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Sale and installation of solar energy systems .
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Sale and installation of solar energy system revenue decreased $2.7 million, or 16.1%, to $14 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $16.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, installations decreased 0.4 megawatts to 3.7 as compared to the 4.1 megawatts installed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	This decrease was primarily due to slower sales in the beginning of the year and a weighted average 10% decline in our ASP.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	Additionally, the Rhode Island Renewal Energy Growth program reached its funding cap earlier than expected through April 1, 2018 which caused a delay in installations originally planned for the fourth quarter of 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	These projects are projected to be installed in the second quarter of 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Service revenue increased $0.4 million, or 53.5%, to $1.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $0.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase is primarily due to a contract entered into with a third-party in the 4 th quarter of 2016 to provide service work on their existing customers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Installation of solar energy systems .
1425565_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Installation of solar energy system expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 8.2%, to $13.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $14.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which corresponds to the reduction of installation revenue during this same time comparison.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We utilize gross margin percentage to measure performance utilizing an internal time reporting system allowing us to measure both total incurred contract expense and contract expense excluding construction crew idle time.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our residential segments gross margin without idle time declined due to a 10% decline in the average selling price per watt exceeding the 2% decline in the costs of installation per watt.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Service expense increased $0.5 million to $1.6 million, or 34.8% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $1.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase is primarily due to the additional costs attributed to a contract entered into with a third-party in the fourth quarter of 2016 to provide service work on their existing customers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Customer acquisition expense increased $0.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, or 2.2%, to $5.9 million from $5.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	This increase is primarily attributable to our revenue growth strategy beginning during the first quarter of 2017 resulting in increased hiring in our sales department, an increase in in digital lead development and an overall commitment to increased marketing efforts to reduce our cost of acquisition.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Operating expenses increased $3 million, or 39.9%, to $10.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in labor.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Litigation and proxy contest expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to $0.02 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to proxy contest expenses of $1.2 million in 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Our legal expenses may increase in subsequent periods.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	On September 14, 2016, we raised $2.8 million of convertible preferred stock that was accounted for as debt.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	By September 29, 2016, all of the convertible preferred stock was converted to Class A common stock of the Company, extinguishing the debt, leaving a balance of $1,000 related to the 2016 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	As a result, there was effectively no interest expense incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a $2.8 million decrease from the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Derivative and other expenses was a $0.2 million gain for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 resulting from a fair market value change in the outstanding warrant liability.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	In comparison, there was a $2.6 million gain in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulting from a change in the fair market value of stock issued from the convertible note, offset by a decrease in the derivative liability of the convertible note.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Debt accretion expense and loss on extinguishment.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, $0.5 million of loss on extinguishment was recorded related to the first quarter conversion of convertible notes, compared to $14 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, $0.4 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued interest under the 2016 Notes were converted into 160,185 shares of Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	As the trading price of our Class A common stock was higher at conversion than the effective conversion price per share to the debt holder, we recorded a loss on extinguishment.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	During the third quarter of 2016 we raised $2.8 million of convertible preferred stock that was accounted for as debt.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	This debt was subsequently converted to Class A common stock and as the trading price of our stock was higher at conversion than the effective conversion price per share to the debt holder, a loss on extinguishment was recorded.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations which have necessitated: (i) developing plans to grow revenue to generate positive cash flow and (ii) raising additional capital.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	No assurances can be given that we will be successful with our plans to grow revenue for profitable operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Subsequent Events for transactions raising capital during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our plans to grow revenue are:
1425565_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Expand our network of authorized third-party installers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	During February 2018, we completed a strategic realignment to scale back our residential solar homeowner business.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	While we have made progress during 2017 in growing solar sales and backlog, growth has not met initial expectations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	The realignment reduced the number of outside sales personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	We plan to maintain the areas of core competencies meeting expectations, such as its e-sales call center and commercial sales organization.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Until we are successful in implementing our plans to increase revenue for profitable operations, we expect to have a cash outflow from operating activities.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We expect to obtain UL certification for POWERHOUSE 3.0 in 2018 and, if we determine to proceed at that time with the commercialization of POWERHOUSE , we expect to have cash outflow from operating activities for commercialization of POWERHOUSE , including the remaining Initial License payment of the $2 million, prepayments with supply chain manufacturers and working capital as sales of the product commence.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and contemplates the continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We have experienced a history of operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of approximately $200 million at December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated a net loss of approximately $17.7 million and we expect that we will continue to generate operating losses until sales are increased and we subsequently recognize an increase in installation revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	At December 31, 2017, our consolidated cash balance was approximately $1.2 million.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	To provide funds to grow our revenue, on March 30, 2018, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement for the 2018 Offering of up to $10.75 million in principal amount and $0.75 million of original issue discount of 2018 Notes with unaffiliated institutional investors.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The 2018 Offering may result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million, before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	We will receive $5 million of the proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes at closing of the 2018 Offering.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	We also will receive Investor Notes from the investors of $5.0 million secured by cash and securities held in escrow.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	Investors are required to prepay the Investor Notes as they convert their Series B Notes issued in the 2018 Offering and, upon satisfaction of Equity Conditions and certain other conditions, upon the occurrence of a specified mandatory prepayment event.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S5	The 2018 Notes will be convertible into Class A common stock and, if not fully converted at maturity, we would seek to refinance a remaining balance at that time from either: (i) refinancing of the obligation with the issuers, (ii) a public offering of securities, or (iii) common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P68_S6	No assurances can be given that should a balance remain on the 2018 Notes at maturity that we will be successful in meeting the obligation under the 2018 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Shareholders Equity for information regarding our 2018 Offering.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We believe that without determining to proceed with the commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0 we have sufficient capital resources for the ensuing 12 months.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	If we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, we will require additional capital which could be met from the Investor Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	In the event capital from the Investor Notes are not received, we would seek obtaining the capital from other transactions such as a public offering of securities, and common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	No assurances can be given that should we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, we will receive the additional capital necessary, either from the Investor Notes or an alternative transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P70_S4	Other than the uncertainties regarding our ability to obtain additional funding, there are currently no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our liquidity.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, certain U.S. based solar module manufacturers filed a petition under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the 201 Tariff ) claiming damages as a result of foreign manufacturers exporting lower priced photovoltaic modules into the U.S. and recommended the cost of foreign manufactured modules have a floor cost of $0.78 per watt, to be reduced over a four-year period.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Currently, we pay a weighted average cost less than the potential floor cost.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	On September 22, 2017, the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) decided that the domestic industry had suffered serious harm due to imports.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	After additional public hearings, on October 31, 2017 the ITC provided remedy recommendations to the President of the United States which stated (i) that a tariff of 30% to 35% of the solar module cost should be applied and (ii) that any such tariff not apply to certain North American treaty partners such as Canada.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Approximately 90% of the equipment we purchase is from North American manufacturers.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	As we sell systems months in advance of their installation and coupled with our cash management approach to adhere to just-in-time procurement of materials, we determined there was sufficient exposure to installation margins to warrant bridge buying inventory at our current pricing and procuring panels in excess of current needs into 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Accordingly, we have invested in our panel inventory, and as of December 31, 2017, have sufficient panel inventory for substantially all planned installations during the first quarter of 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	On January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States approved in substantial form, recommendations by the ITC to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff are applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	We have entered into a bi-annual purchase arrangement with our North American panel provider to stabilize the price per watt for panels.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	Accordingly, we do not believe the impact of the 201 Tariff will have a material effect on our operations.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of cash during the periods presented:
1425565_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Cash outflow from operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.2 million as compared to the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in customer acquisition expense as contemplated our revenue growth strategy, (ii) an increase in inventory to secure solar panels at pre-201 Tariff pricing and (iii) an increase in litigation and proxy costs attributable to activist shareholder actions.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we internally developed RGS 365 customer-centric software at a cost of $0.5 million with $0.4 million paid during the year.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Additionally, expenditures related to our move of corporate headquarters resulted in cash outflows related to leasehold improvements, furnishings and computer equipment of approximately $0.4 million.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	We also capitalized costs related to the POWERHOUSE license of $1.1 million.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our financing activities provided net cash of $16.2 million and $14.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Our net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflected the release of restricted cash of $0.2 million related to the 2016 Note offering, net proceeds of $16.0 million from the issuance of common stock during the February 2017 offerings, borrowings against our revolving line of credit of $1.5 million offset by repayment of our line-of-credit facility of $2.5 million.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Discontinued operations provided net cash of $0.5 million and used $1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	In 2017, we realized $0.4 million attributable to performance based output (watts produced) from certain previously installed commercial projects.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The net cash outflow in 2016 primarily arose from the cash payment for a surety bond, coupled with payments of accounts payable.
1425565_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	We have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

1425565_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Real Goods Solar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P7_S3	As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P7_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

1425565_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Real Goods Solar, Inc. ( RGS or the Company ) is a residential and commercial solar energy engineering, procurement, and construction firm.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RGS and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	RGS has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which include the Company s accounts and those of its subsidiaries.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the effective date of acquisition.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of operations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The application of the going concern basis is dependent upon the Company achieving profitable operations to generate sufficient cash flows to fund continued operations, or, in the absence of adequate cash flows from operations, obtaining additional financing.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Company has reported losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $200 million at December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P17_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Management continues to review operations in order to identify additional strategies designed to generate cash flow, improve the Company's financial position, and enable the timely discharge of the Company's obligations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	If management is unable to identify sources of additional cash flow in the short term, it may be required to further reduce or limit operations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company reports all share and per share amounts reflecting the most recent reverse stock split.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	During 2014, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain contracts and rights comprised of the Company s large commercial installations business, otherwise known as the Company s former Commercial segment.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	At the same time, the Company determined not to enter into further large commercial installation contracts in the mainland United States.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	Most contracts in process at December 31, 2014 were substantially completed during 2015 and remaining work was completed in 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company now reports this business as a discontinued operation, separate from the Company s continuing operations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	A material significant event occurred on September 29, 2017 (the Effective Date ), when the Company executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide Technology License Agreement (the License ) with Dow Global Technologies LLC ( Dow ) for its POWERHOUSE in-roof solar shingle.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	The License requires the Company to commercialize and sell a minimum of 50 megawatts of solar within 5-years of the Effective Date to retain exclusive world-wide rights, a requirement the Company believes is achievable.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	In addition to the License, the Company and Dow executed a Trademark License Agreement (the TLA ), a Technology Service Agreement (the TSA ) and a Sales Agreement-Surplus Property (the Sales Agreement ).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	The execution of the TLA will allow RGS to market the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product using the Dow name.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Sales Agreement identified used manufacturing molds that Dow transferred title to RGS for a cost of $1.00.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Under the terms of the License, the Company will produce, market and sell the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product, for which it has agreed to a license fee of $3 million and a running royalty fee equal to 2.5% against net sales of the POWERHOUSE product and services, payable quarterly in arrears.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Further, the Company will be responsible for all post-Effective Date costs to obtain United Laboratories certification ( UL Certification ) and for the prosecution of all related patents world-wide, which may be offset against the payment of the running royalty fee.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The license fee is comprised of two payments; the first $1 million was paid in connection with the Effective Date of the License in 2017 in accordance with the TLA.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	The remaining $2 million is due within 30 days after the Company receiving UL Certification of the POWERHOUSE 3.0 product.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Upon obtaining UL Certification, the Company intends to begin commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0 entailing the manufacturing, marketing and sale of POWERHOUSE 3.0 to roofing companies.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations which have necessitated: (i) developing plans to grow revenue to generate positive cash flow and (ii) raising additional capital.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful with its plans to grow revenue for profitable operations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Subsequent Events for transactions raising capital during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company plans to grow revenue are:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Expand the Company s network of authorized third-party installers.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	During February 2018, the Company completed a strategic realignment to scale back the Company s residential solar homeowner business.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	While the Company has made progress during 2017 in growing solar sales and backlog, growth has not met initial expectations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	The realignment reduced the number of outside sales personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company plans to maintain the areas of core competencies meeting expectations, such as its e-sales call center and commercial sales organization.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Until the Company is successful in implementing its plans to increase revenue for profitable operations, the Company expects to have a cash outflow from operating activities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company expects to obtain UL certification for POWERHOUSE 3.0 in 2018 and, if it determines to proceed at that time with the commercialization of POWERHOUSE , the Company expects to have cash outflow from operating activities for commercialization of POWERHOUSE , prepayments with supply chain manufacturers and working capital as sales of the product commence.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Additionally, the Company would be required to make the remaining Initial License payment of the $2 million, which would be recorded as a cash outflow in investing activities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	To provide funds to grow the Company s revenue, on March 30, 2018, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement for the 2018 Offering, as defined and described in Note 6.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The 2018 Offering may result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million, before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Company will receive $5 million of the proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes (as defined in Note 6.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	The Company also will receive Investor Notes in an aggregate amount of $5.0 million secured by cash and/or securities held in investor accounts.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	Investors are required to prepay the Investor Notes as they convert their Series B Notes issued in the 2018 Offering and, upon satisfaction of Equity Conditions and certain other conditions, upon the occurrence of a specified mandatory prepayment event.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S5	The 2018 Notes will be convertible into Class A common stock and if not fully converted into shares of Class A common stock at maturity, we would seek to refinance a remaining balance at that time from: (i) negotiations with the holders of the 2018 Notes, (ii) funds obtained in a public or private offering of securities, or (iii) common stock warrant exercises including our reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P31_S6	No assurances can be given that should a balance remain on the 2018 Notes at maturity that we will be successful in meeting the obligation under the 2018 Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	If the Company determines to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, it will require additional capital which could be met from the Investor Notes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	In the event capital from the Investor Notes are not received by the Company, the Company would seek to obtain the capital from other transactions such as a public offering of securities, and common stock warrant exercises including the Company reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	No assurances can be given that, should the Company determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE 3.0, it will receive the additional capital necessary, either from the Investor Notes or an alternative transaction.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	No changes were made to the Company s significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Significant estimates are used to value warranty liabilities, the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments, common stock warrants, and allowance for doubtful accounts.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	The reclassifications did not impact prior period results of operations, cash flows, total assets, total liabilities or total equity.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	During the second quarter of 2017, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify items in the statement of operations to conform with operating metrics reported to investors and the manner in which management evaluates financial performance and to classify warranty liability separately as current and non-current liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	Accordingly, the Company revised the classification of certain items to report items in the statement of operations and balance sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P35_S4	These changes in classification did not change the previously reported operating income (loss) in the statement of operations, or cash generated (used) from operations in the statement of cash flows, or operating income (loss) for any business segment.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Cash represents demand deposit accounts with financial institutions that are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company estimates anticipated losses based on the expected collectability of all accounts receivable, taking into account collection history, number of days past due, identification of specific customer exposure and current economic trends.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	When the Company determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues collection of the account, it is written off.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Inventory consists primarily of solar energy system components (such as solar panels and inverters) located at Company warehouses and its cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory items based on an estimate of the markdown to the retail price required to sell or dispose of such items.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company has an allowance for obsolete or slow-moving inventory of $0.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally three to twenty years.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	RGS amortizes leasehold and building improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease or remaining life of the building, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively, customer relationships ), trademarks, and non-compete agreements are initially recorded at fair value.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S5	If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P43_S6	Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The use of present value techniques requires us to make estimates and judgments about the Company s future cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	These cash flow forecasts will be based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage its business.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	For sales of solar energy systems and components of less than 100 kilowatts (kW), residential and small commercial customers, the Company recognizes revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-25 , Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements , and ASC 605-10-S99 , Revenue Recognition Overall SEC Materials .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Components are principally comprised of photovoltaic panels, inverters, and solar energy system mounting hardware.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it installs a solar energy system, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated balance sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	For those systems of 100kW or greater, commercial customers, the Company recognizes revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total projected costs.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The assets Costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and Deferred costs on uncompleted contracts represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion method contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The liability Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of related costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company invoices large installation customers according to milestones defined in their respective contracts.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment form as per the contract, which is done after each month end.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Unbilled receivables were included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Deferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation fees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	RGS recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Company measures compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value for purposes of accounting and disclosures.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note 8.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	Share-Based Compensation), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P56_S5	The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of reported compensation expense.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P57_S4	RGS has significant net operating loss carry-forwards and evaluates at the end of each reporting period whether it expects it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable and provides a tax valuation allowance as necessary.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company warrants solar energy systems sold to customers for up to 10 years against defects in installation workmanship.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The manufacturers warranties on the solar energy system components, which are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance warranty period of 25 years.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	The Company also maintains specific warranty liabilities for large commercial customers included in discontinued operations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	The Company assesses the accrued warranty reserve regularly and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	RGS computes net loss per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or warrants to issue shares of the Company s Class A common stock were exercised.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	Common share equivalents of 5,857,861 and 843,163 shares have been omitted from net loss per share for 2017 and 2016, respectively, as they are anti-dilutive.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company did not have any customer who accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, nor did it have any customer representing over 10% of sales during 2017 or 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company s chief operating decision maker is the executive team.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	Based on the financial information presented to and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate the resources and in assessing the performance of the Company, the Company has determined that it has four reporting segments: residential solar installations, Sunetric installations, POWERHOUSE and corporate expenses ( other segment ).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company accounts for complex financial instruments including convertible notes, convertible preferred stock, and warrants under ASC 815 and ASC 480.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company utilizes third party appraisers to determine the fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	Certain of the Company s warrants are accounted for as liabilities due to provisions either allowing the warrant holder to request redemption, at the intrinsic value of the warrant, upon a change of control and/or providing for an adjustment to the number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock underlying the warrants and the exercise price in connection with dilutive future funding transactions.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	The Company classifies these derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as current and long-term liabilities, which are revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to their initial issuance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	For financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, the Company defers and amortizes to operations costs incurred including the initial fair value of warrants issued and derivative liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The issuance costs of financial instruments accounted for as equity are charged to additional paid in capital.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The extinguishment of financial instruments accounted for as debt that are extinguished by issuance of common stock are recorded at the fair value of common stock issued at the date of issuance, with any difference from the carrying value of the liability recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	To determine lease classification, the Company evaluates lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life, or whether the present value of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	All of the Company s leased systems are treated as sales-type leases under GAAP accounting policies.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Financing receivables are generated by solar energy systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Financing receivables represents gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term of up to 20 years and the systems estimated residual value, net of allowance for estimated losses.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	Initial direct costs for sales-type leases are recognized as cost of sales when the solar energy systems are placed in service.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	For systems classified as sales-type leases, the net present value of the minimum lease payments, net of executory costs, is recognized as revenue when the lease is placed in service.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	This net present value as well as the net present value of the residual value of the lease at termination are recorded as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	The difference between the initial net amounts and the gross amounts are amortized to revenue over the lease term using the interest method.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	The residual values of the Company s solar energy systems are determined at the inception of the lease applying an estimated system fair value at the end of the lease term.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	RGS considers the credit risk profile for its lease customers to be homogeneous due to the criteria the Company uses to approve customers for its residential leasing program, which among other things, requires a minimum fair FICO credit quality.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Accordingly, the Company does not regularly categorize its financing receivables by credit risk.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	On March 13, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-05 ( ASU 2018-05 ), Income Taxes (Topic 740) Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 , which was issued to state the income tax accounting implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance clarifies the measurement period timeframe, changes in subsequent reporting periods and reporting requirements as a result of the TCJA.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	The measurement period begins in the period that includes the TCJA s enactment date which was December 22, 2017 and as a result the Company has reflected the impact of this ASU on the tax provision and deferred tax calculation as of December 31, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	On July 13, 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-11 ( ASU 2017-11 ), Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S4	The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S5	Those amendments do not have an accounting effect.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S6	For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P75_S7	The amendments in Part II of this Update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The company will assess the impact of ASU 2017-11 on any derivative instruments entered into in the future.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04 ( ASU 2017-04 ), Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment , which was issued to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	Impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance remains largely unchanged.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017, and the Company is assessing the impact of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-20 ( ASU 2016-20 ), Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	This ASU provides technical corrections and improvements to Topic 606.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	This ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, which coincides with the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	The Company expects the adoption of ASU 2016-20 will have minimal impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18 ( ASU 2016-18 ), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which was issued to address the diversity that currently exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts general described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company has determined that it will have minimal impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ), Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which was issued to provide clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are reported in the statement of cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce existing diversity between companies.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	Early adoption is permitted and the Company has determined that it will have minimal impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S3	A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S4	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S5	The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S6	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P82_S7	The Company currently expects that upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be recognized in the balance sheet in amounts that will be material.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1425565_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The core principle of the revenue model is that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	Transfer of control is not the same as transfer of risks and rewards, as it is considered in current guidance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 one year.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASU 2014-09, as deferred by ASU 2015-14, will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, we evaluated our contracts with customers and have determined that for the majority of our contracts there will not be any significant change to timing or method of recognizing revenue.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	As such, we do not believe this new standard will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, and utilized the modified retrospective method, which requires a disclosure of the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	In the year of adoption, the Company must also disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current year as a result of applying the revenue standard and a qualitative explanation of the significant changes between the reported results under the revenue standard and the previous revenue guidance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	Property and equipment, stated at lower of cost or estimated fair value, consists of the following as of December 31:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	On May 23, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Mobomo, LLC ( Mobomo ) pursuant to the design and development of intellectual property at a cost of $0.5 million.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The intellectual property consisted of an integrated mobile phone application and the new RGS 365 customer portal.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the Company has an accrued expense of $0.1 million for the remaining payment.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Mobomo s Chief Executive Officer Brian Lacey is the son of the Company s CEO Dennis Lacey.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company approved the agreement in accordance with its related-party transaction policy.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company leases office and warehouse space through operating leases.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	Some of the leases have renewal clauses, which range from one month to five years.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company leases vehicles through operating leases for certain field personnel.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Leases range up to five years with varying termination dates through August 2020.

1425565_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Company incurred office and warehouse rent expense of $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	The Company incurred automobile lease expense of $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business, including legal proceedings; governmental regulation, such as the interpretation of tax and labor laws; and the seasonal nature of its business due to weather-related factors.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company has accrued for probable and estimable costs incurred with respect to identified risks and uncertainties based upon the facts and circumstances currently available.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	As previously disclosed in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017, on February 16, 2017, Alpha Capital Anstalt ( Alpha ), an investor in the Company s February 7, 2017 public offering of common stock and warrants, filed a lawsuit against Roth Capital Partners, LLC, the Company s investment banking firm in the offering, and the Company in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	Alpha s lawsuit initially alleged that the registration statement for the February 7, 2017 offering contained material misstatements or omissions and that the Company had breached contractual obligations owed to Alpha.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	Alpha seeks unspecified monetary damages, rescission and other unspecified relief in the lawsuit.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S3	The Company disputes Alpha s allegations and is vigorously defending the lawsuit.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S4	Under local court rules, the Company filed a letter motion seeking permission to file a motion to dismiss the claims related to the alleged misstatements and omissions in the complaint.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S5	On May 12, 2017, Alpha filed an amended complaint removing the securities and fraud-related claims and leaving only breach of contract claims against the Company.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P95_S6	Because the Company has been unwilling to entertain settlement discussions, Alpha has recently deposed members of the Company and the Company s legal team that represented the Company in the offering.

1425565_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	FASB ASC No. 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures- Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 820-10-35 ), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P122_S3	ASC 820-10-35-3 also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P122_S4	Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	ASC 820-10-35 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
1425565_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Level 1 Inputs Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	An active market is a market in which transactions occur for the item to be fair valued with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Level 2 Inputs Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	Level 2 inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	These inputs include: (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, such as when there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially over time or in which little information is released publicly; (c) Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and (d) Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	Level 3 Inputs Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P127_S1	These inputs should be used to determine fair value only when observable inputs are not available.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P127_S2	Unobservable inputs should be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include internally generated data and assumptions being used to price the asset or liability.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	The following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	For the Company s Level 3 measures, which represent common stock warrants, fair value is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model that is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Company used a market approach to value these derivative liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning to the ending balance for the Company s common stock warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (i.e. Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2017:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	At December 31, 2017, the Company s 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provided that an aggregate of 52,536 shares of its Class A common stock may be awarded under the plan.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	Both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	Employees, members of the Board of Directors, consultants, service providers and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which terminates upon the earlier of a board resolution terminating the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan or ten years after the effective date of the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	All outstanding options are nonqualified and are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Options vest based on service conditions, performance (attainment of a certain amount of pre-tax income for a given year), or some combination thereof.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	Grants typically expire seven years from the date of grant.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The determination of the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	Expected volatilities are based on a value calculated using the combination of historical volatility of comparable public companies in RGS industry and its stock price volatility since the Company s initial public offering.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P138_S1	Expected life is based on the specific vesting terms of the option and anticipated changes to market value and expected employee exercise behavior.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	RGS does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Class A common stock in the foreseeable future and, therefore, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	RGS is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	In accordance with ASU 2016-09, an entity can make an accounting policy to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	The Company will continue to utilize the plan life-to-date forfeiture experience rate to estimate option forfeitures and records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	The table below presents a summary of the Company s option activity as of December 31, 2017 and changes during the years then ended:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Company did not grant any stock options and cancelled 36 stock options during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus zero grants of stock options and cancellations of 28 stock options during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	The Company s share-based compensation cost charged against income for continuing operations was approximately $0.2 million and $0.7 million during the years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	On December 22, 2017, The President of the United States signed the TCJA.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	The enactment of TCJA requires companies, under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P145_S1	The TCJA would permanently reduce the maximum corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the future benefits of existing deferred tax assets would need to be computed at the new tax rate.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	The tax effects recorded primarily include an estimate of the impact of the reduction in the U.S. tax rate on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	We consider the amounts recorded to be provisional amounts primarily because we continue to evaluate the tax effects of the 2017 TCJA on the realizability of deferred tax assets and remeasurement of certain temporary differences at the new tax rates and the impact of other retroactive provisions.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	Additionally, we consider these amounts preliminary as we continue to evaluate the impacts of the 2017 TCJA as we further understand its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulator rules, regulations and interpretations.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company had $0 of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	Variations from the federal statutory rate are as follows:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	The components of the net accumulated deferred income tax assets shown on a gross basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:
1425565_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	At December 31, 2017, RGS had $141 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring, if not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P151_S1	Additionally, the Company had $128 million of state net operating loss carryforwards expiring, it not utilized, beginning in 2020.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitation under applicable federal and state ownership change limitations and, accordingly, net operating losses may expire before utilization.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	The Company has not completed a Section 382 analysis through December 2017 and therefore has not determined the impact of any ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred in prior years.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P152_S2	Therefore, the net operating loss carryforwards above do not reflect any possible limitations and potential loss attributes to such ownership changes.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P152_S3	However, the Company believes that upon completion of a Section 382 analysis, as a result of prior period ownership changes, substantially all of the net operating losses will be subject to limitation.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company s valuation allowance decreased by approximately $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of its operating loss for the year and the change in the corporate tax rate from the TCJA.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P153_S2	Based upon the available objective evidence and the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P153_S3	At December 31, 2017, the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets net of the expected income from the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company s predecessor, Real Goods Trading Corporation, was acquired by Gaiam, Inc. (now known as Gaia, Inc. and hereinafter as Gaia) in 2001.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P154_S1	Gaia operated Real Goods Trading Corporation essentially as a separate business until 2008 when operations were consolidated into the corporate entity, Real Goods Solar, Inc., upon its formation.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	Following the Company s initial public offering, a tax sharing agreement was entered into with Gaia.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	The Company is required, under the terms of its tax sharing agreement with Gaia, to distribute to Gaia the tax effect of certain tax loss carryforwards as utilized by the Company in preparing its federal, state and local income tax returns.
1425565_18_ITEM8_P155_S2	At December 31, 2017, utilizing the new federal income tax rate of 21% under the TCJA, the Company estimates that the maximum amount of such distributions to Gaia could aggregate $1.0 million.

1425565_18_ITEM11_P11_S2	We do not provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans to our executives or other employees other than our 401(k) Plan described herein.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	In fiscal 2017, our named executive officers were eligible to receive the same health care coverage that was generally available to our other employees.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	Our benefit programs include medical, dental and vision insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, business travel insurance, wellness programs (including chiropractic, massage therapy, acupuncture, and fitness classes), relocation/expatriate programs and services, educational assistance, and certain other benefits.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	Our compensation committee believes that our 401(k) Plan and the other generally available benefit programs allow us to remain competitive for employee talent, and that the availability of the benefit programs generally enhances employee productivity and loyalty to us.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P13_S1	The main objectives of our benefits programs are to give our employees access to quality healthcare, financial protection from unforeseen events, assistance in achieving retirement financial goals, and enhanced health and productivity, in full compliance with applicable legal requirements.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P13_S2	Typically, these generally available benefits do not specifically factor into decisions regarding an individual executive officer s total compensation or 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan award package.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	Our compensation committee administers and grants awards under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and has granted to our chief executive officer the authority to make awards to our employees that do not report directly to the chief executive officer.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P14_S1	During fiscal 2017, our chief executive officer, compensation committee and board of directors consistently applied the following guidelines for stock option grant timing practices:
1425565_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	New Employees : stock option grants to new hires are effective on the first day of the new employee s employment with us or upon approval by our chief executive officer, compensation committee or board of directors, as applicable, and the exercise price for the options is set at the closing price of our Class A common stock on that date.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	Existing Employees : stock option grants to existing employees are effective on the date that our chief executive officer, compensation committee or board of directors, as applicable, approves the grant, and the exercise price for the options is set at the closing price of our Class A common stock on that date.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	On June 1, 2015, we entered into a written employment agreement with Dennis Lacey, outlining the terms of his employment as our Chief Executive Officer.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P17_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Lacey will receive an initial annual base salary of $375,000.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P17_S2	Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, adjust his base salary but may not reduce the base salary unless such reduction is done in connection with a broad reduction of compensation of our management.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	For each fiscal year, Mr. Lacey is eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to 100% of his base salary, subject to such terms and conditions and upon achievement of performance targets as determined by the board of directors or a committee created by its board of directors.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P18_S1	Mr. Lacey must be an employee on the date a performance bonus is to be paid to be eligible to receive it.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P18_S2	We did not pay Mr. Lacey any bonuses for 2016 or 2017.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	Mr. Lacey is eligible to participate in the Company s 401(k) plan and is eligible for expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred in connection with his duties under his employment agreement.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P19_S1	Mr. Lacey is also eligible for coverage under group insurance plans and to receive fringe benefits made available to the Company s executive and management employees.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P19_S2	The Company will pay the premiums for coverage of Mr. Lacey and his dependents under such insurance plans.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	The term of the employment agreement continues until terminated and may be terminated as described below and (i) by mutual agreement between the parties, (ii) automatically upon Mr. Lacey s death or disability, (iii) by Mr. Lacey for any or no reason upon 30 days prior written notice, and (iv) by the Company for cause, as discussed below, effective immediately.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P20_S1	If terminated in this manner, the Company will pay to Mr. Lacey any accrued but unpaid base salary, accrued but unused vacation and reimbursable business expenses and Mr. Lacey is not entitled to any severance benefits.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	Cause is defined as Mr. Lacey (i) violating in any material respect any term of the employment agreement or a nondisclosure agreement entered into with the Company in 2014, (ii) violating any Company policy, procedure or guideline that results in material harm to the Company, (iii) acting with gross negligence in the performance of his duties resulting in harm to the Company, (iv) engaging in any of the following forms of misconduct: commission of any felony or any misdemeanor involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; theft or misuse of Company s property; illegal use or possession of any controlled substance; discriminatory or harassing behavior, whether or not illegal under federal, state or local law; or falsifying any document or making any materially false or misleading statement relating to his employment, or (v) failing to cure, within 30 days, any material injury to the economic or ethical welfare of the Company caused by his malfeasance, gross misconduct or material inattention to his duties and responsibilities under the employment agreement (such cure right being limited to one occurrence unless otherwise agreed to by the board of directors).
1425565_18_ITEM11_P22_S0	In addition to the foregoing, if the Company terminates Mr. Lacey s employment without cause, Mr. Lacey is entitled to severance compensation equal to 12 months of his most recent base salary, which shall be payable in equal installments in accordance with the Company s standard payroll practice.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P22_S1	However, if the Company terminates Mr. Lacey s employment within 12 months after the consummation of a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement and as discussed below), such severance payment shall equal 12 months of Mr. Lacey s most recent base salary plus the maximum performance bonus that Mr. Lacey may earn for such fiscal year and shall be payable in one lump sum within 30 calendar days after termination of employment.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P23_S0	A change of control means any transaction or series of related transactions (i) the result of which is that any person or persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Company voting stock (including securities convertible or exercisable for voting stock), (ii) that results in the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets, or (iii) that results in a consolidation or merger whereby the Company is not the surviving entity.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P24_S0	Mr. Lacey s receipt of severance compensation is conditioned on his executing release and confidentiality agreements as further described in the employment agreement.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P25_S0	Furthermore, subject to notice and cure periods, Mr. Lacey may terminate the employment agreement for good reason, if, without Mr. Lacey s prior consent, (i) the Company materially breaches its obligations under the employment agreement, (ii) following a change of control, the successor company fails to assume the Company s obligations under the employment agreement, or (iii) within 12 months after a change of control, (A) Mr. Lacey is no longer the Chief Executive Officer of the surviving company, (B) his duties are materially altered or his authority is materially diminished, (C) his employment-related benefits are materially diminished, or (D) the Company s principal executive offices are moved more than 25 miles from their current location.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P25_S1	A termination for good reason is deemed to be a termination by the Company without cause.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P26_S0	On May 31, 2015 and in connection with entering into the employment agreement, our board of directors granted Mr. Lacey options to purchase 34 shares of the Company s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1,428 per share under the Incentive Plan.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P26_S1	At the time of grant, 25% of the options immediately vest and the remaining 75% subsequently vest in equal quarterly installments over the five-year period following the grant.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P26_S2	The options awarded to Mr. Lacey are subject to the terms of a new standard form of Employee Stock Option Agreement adopted by the compensation committee in May 2015, under which we expect to grant options under the Incentive Plan, and includes the following terms and conditions:
1425565_18_ITEM11_P27_S0	In connection with their receipt of stock options under the Employee Stock Option Agreement, employees agree to be subject to typical non-disparagement, confidentiality and non-compete provisions.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P28_S0	Other than as described below, we have not entered into traditional employment agreements with any other named executive officers.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P28_S1	Generally, those named executive officers who have been granted stock options, are subject to covenants concerning confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation of employees and customers and assignment of inventions contained in our standard form of stock option agreement executed upon grant.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P29_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement with Mr. Lacey, Mr. Lacey is entitled to receive the severance payments in the amount and pursuant to the terms described above in Employment Agreements and Compensation for our Named Executive Officers Dennis Lacey.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P30_S0	Our standard form of stock option agreement provides that option vesting ceases upon termination of employment.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P30_S1	A former employee may exercise vested options (i) within 30 days (generally), (ii) within three months (upon retirement at or after normal retirement age) or (iii) within one year (upon termination due to death or disability or (iv) within one year (after a change of control) after termination, but in no event after the expiration term of the applicable option.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P30_S2	Additionally, 100% of unvested options immediately vest upon the occurrence of a change of control.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P31_S0	In designing our compensation programs, we take into consideration the accounting and tax effect that each element will or may have on us and our executive officers and other employees.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P31_S1	We aim to keep the expense related to our compensation programs as a whole within certain affordability levels.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P31_S2	When determining how to apportion between differing elements of compensation, our goal is to meet our objectives while maintaining relative cost neutrality.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P31_S3	For instance, if we increase benefits under one program resulting in higher compensation expense, we may seek to decrease costs under another program in order to avoid a compensation expense that is above the level then deemed affordable under existing circumstances.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P32_S0	For options, we recognize a charge to earnings for accounting purposes equally from the grant date until the end of the vesting period.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P33_S0	We believe we have structured our compensation program to comply with Internal Revenue Code Sections 162(m) and 409A.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P34_S0	Under Section 162(m), a limitation is placed on tax deductions of any publicly-held corporation for individual compensation to certain executives of such corporation exceeding $1 million in any taxable year, unless the compensation is performance-based.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P34_S1	If an executive is entitled to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are subject to Section 409A, and such benefits do not comply with Section 409A, then the benefits are taxable in the first year they are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P34_S2	In such case, the service provider is subject to regular federal income tax, interest and an additional federal income tax of 20% of the benefit includible in income.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P35_S0	We do not believe we have individuals with non-performance based compensation paid in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) tax deduction limit.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P36_S0	During 2017, directors who were not employees of our company or its affiliates were paid an annual retainer of $20,000 plus fees of $1,000 for each in-person board meeting attended, $200 for each telephonic board meeting attended, $500 for each committee meeting attended and $200 for each telephonic committee meeting attended.
1425565_18_ITEM11_P36_S1	Members of each standing committee receive an annual fee of $4,000 and chairpersons of each standing committee receive an annual fee of $10,000.

1425565_18_ITEM13_P1_S0	We believe that Hudson Bay Master Fund, Ltd. ( Hudson Bay ) currently is a related person as a result of being the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding Class A common stock.
1425565_18_ITEM13_P1_S1	In addition, we believe that Hudson Bay was a related person when we entered into the transactions described below.
