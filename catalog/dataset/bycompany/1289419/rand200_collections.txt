1289419_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Morningstar is a leading provider of independent investment research to investors around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Since our founding in 1984, our mission has been to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	We offer an extensive line of data, software, and research products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients through our Investment Information segment.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	We also provide asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants through our Investment Management segment.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P0_S4	In addition to our U.S.-based products and services, we offer local versions of our products designed for investors in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and South Africa.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Morningstar serves approximately 7.4 million individual investors, 270,000 financial advisors, and 4,300 institutional clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We have operations in 26 countries.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We maintain a series of comprehensive databases on many types of investments, focusing on investment vehicles that are widely used by investors globally.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	After building these databases, we add value and insight to the data by applying our core skills of research, technology, and design.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we provided extensive data on approximately 380,000 investments, including:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Real-time price quotes for global foreign currencies.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business model is based on leveraging our investments in these databases by selling a wide variety of products and services to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our data and proprietary analytical tools such as the Morningstar Rating for mutual funds, which rates past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, and the Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund s underlying investment style, have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We ve created other tools, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Market Barometer, which allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We developed a popular Portfolio X-Ray tool that helps investors reduce risk and understand the key characteristics of their portfolios based on nine different factors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We offer a variety of qualitative measures such as Stewardship Grades, which help investors identify companies and funds that have demonstrated a high level of commitment to shareholders and stewardship of investors capital.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	We also offer qualitative research and ratings on mutual funds based in Europe, Asia, and Australia; closed-end funds; 529 plans; target-date funds, and stocks.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Since 1998, we ve expanded our research efforts on individual stocks and have worked to popularize the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett; and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock s price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock s current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company s level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 2009, we began publishing credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We currently provide ratings on more than 720 companies and also provide research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We ve also developed in-depth advice on security selection and portfolio building to meet the needs of investors looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe many investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In keeping with our mission, we are pursuing five key growth strategies, which we describe below.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We review our growth strategies on a regular basis and refine them to reflect changes in our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	1. Enhance our position in each of our key market segments by focusing on our three major Internet-based platforms.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients increasingly want integrated solutions as opposed to using different research tools for different parts of their portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	To help meet this need, our strategy is to focus our product offerings on our three major platforms:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Morningstar.com for individual investors; Morningstar Advisor Workstation for financial advisors; and Morningstar Direct for institutional professionals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	These products all include integrated research and portfolio tools, allowing investors to use our proprietary information and analysis across multiple security types.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	With each platform, we believe we can continue expanding our reach with our current audience, as well as extending to reach new market segments.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	With Morningstar.com, we re continuing to expand the range of content and market updates on the site, including third-party content.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We ve also been focusing on mobile development and social networking, as well as expanding data and functionality to increase the site s value to both registered users and Premium members.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	With Advisor Workstation, we plan to build on our large installed base by expanding our mid- and back-office capabilities, improving the product s interface and design, and integrating real-time data and other functionality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	With Morningstar Direct, we re pursuing an aggressive development program to provide data and analysis on securities and investments around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S4	We re adding third-party data and content and enhancing our technology to allow the product to function as a purely web-based solution.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P15_S5	We also plan to expand into new global markets, enhance our capabilities in portfolio management and accounting, and significantly increase the amount of equity research content and functionality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	2. Create a premier global investment database.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our goal is to continue building or acquiring new databases for additional types of investments, including various types of funds outside the United States and other widely used investment products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	As detailed on page 2, we currently provide extensive data on nearly 380,000 investments globally, including managed investment products, individual securities, capital markets data, real-time stock quotes from nearly all of the world s major stock exchanges, and a live data feed that covers exchange-traded equities, derivatives, commodities, futures, foreign exchanges, precious metals, news, company fundamentals, and analytics.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our data is the foundation for all of the products and services we offer.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	We focus on proprietary, value-added data, such as our comprehensive data on current and historical portfolio holdings for mutual funds and variable annuities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	Within each database, we continuously update our data to maintain timeliness and expand the depth and breadth of coverage.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our strategy is to continuously expand our databases, focusing on investment products that are widely used by large numbers of investors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S4	In particular, we re focusing on expanding our fundamental equity data.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P19_S5	We also strive to establish our databases as the pre-eminent choice for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients around the world, as well as continuing to invest in world-class data quality, processing, and delivery.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Over the past several years, we ve developed a series of proprietary indexes based on our investment data.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Morningstar Indexes are rooted in our proprietary research and can be used for precise asset allocation and benchmarking and as tools for portfolio construction and market analysis.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	We ve expanded the range of indexes we offer over the past three years and are working to expand our index business globally.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Continue building thought leadership in independent investment research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our goal is to continue producing investment insights that empower investors and focus our research efforts in four major areas:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Extend leadership position in fund research to additional markets outside the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Over the past several years, we have expanded our analyst coverage in fund markets outside of the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	We ve built an integrated team of locally based fund experts to expand our research coverage in additional markets around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we had nearly 100 fund analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	We currently produce qualitative analyst research on more than 1,500 funds outside the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Continue leveraging our capabilities in stocks.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our equity research complements our approach to mutual fund analysis, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund s portfolio.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we provided analyst research on approximately 2,300 companies globally.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	We re committed to maintaining the broad, high-quality coverage we ve become known for as one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We re working to expand distribution of our equity research through a variety of channels, including through financial advisors, buy-side firms, and companies outside of the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	We believe that investors increasing awareness of the value of independent research will strengthen our business over the long term.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	We ve also expanded our proprietary stock database, which we view as an important complement to our analyst research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Build business in fixed-income credit research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	We began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers in December 2009 and currently produce research and ratings on more than 720 corporate credit issuers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	In 2010, we entered into our first credit research agreement with a major financial services firm to provide credit ratings and research to its 18,000 financial advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We view credit ratings as a natural extension of the equity research we ve been producing for the past decade.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	We believe we have a unique viewpoint to offer on company default risk that leverages our cash-flow modeling expertise, proprietary measures like economic moat, and in-depth knowledge of the companies and industries we cover.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S5	We re including this research on our three major software platforms to provide investors with an additional perspective on fixed-income investments.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P26_S6	We also plan to monetize the ratings through subscriptions to our institutional equity research clients, who have access to the forecasts, models, and scores underlying the ratings.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also expanded our fixed-income capabilities with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Realpoint currently covers commercial mortgage-backed securities and plans to introduce research on residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe investors are looking for better research and analytics on RMBS and that we re well-positioned to meet this need.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	As the baby boom generation approaches retirement, we believe investors will need more information to help them manage income during retirement, including tools focusing on retirement-income planning and long-term savings strategies.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	During 2010, our Ibbotson Associates subsidiary continued its work on adding longevity protection (through the use of variable annuities) to investors retirement portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Ibbotson also rolled out a new target-date fund with one of its clients that incorporates annuities and is the first consultant to work on creating this type of product.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	We also expanded our analyst research on target-date and target-risk portfolios in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We ve developed several other retirement income tools and services through Morningstar Advisor Workstation and our Investment Consulting area, and we plan to incorporate additional retirement income tools and services in other products over the next several years.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	4. Become a global leader in fund-of-funds investment management.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The large number of managed investment products available has made assembling them into well-constructed portfolios a difficult task for many investors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Consequently, fund-of-funds offerings have seen strong growth within the mutual fund, variable annuity, and hedge fund industries.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Cerulli Associates estimates that global multimanager assets including publicly offered funds that invest in other funds as well as investment vehicles managed by multiple subadvisors totaled approximately $1.7 trillion in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe assembling and evaluating funds of funds is a natural extension of our expertise in understanding managed investment products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our fund-of-funds programs combine managed investment vehicles typically mutual funds in portfolios designed to help investors meet their financial goals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	When we create portfolios made up of other funds, our goal is to simplify the investment process and help investors access portfolios that match their level of risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term investment objectives.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	We draw on our extensive experience analyzing funds and combine quantitative research with a qualitative assessment of manager skill and investment style.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	In April 2010, we expanded our investment management business by acquiring Old Broad Street Research Ltd, a premier provider of fund research, ratings, and investment consulting services in the United Kingdom.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	In July 2010, we acquired Seeds Group, a leading provider of investment consulting services and fund research in France.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	We had a total of $107.2 billion in assets under advisement in our Investment Consulting business as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our consulting business focuses on relationships and agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager or asset allocation program designer for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis-point fee.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We plan to continue building this business by expanding to reach new markets outside of the United States, expanding our capabilities in areas such as alternative investment strategies, developing more ways to incorporate risk protection and insurance, expanding to reach additional client segments, and focusing on performance and client support.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	In 2011, we plan to focus on unifying our Investment Consulting capabilities and operations to offer our clients the best combination of solutions and capabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We also offer managed retirement account services through our Retirement Advice platform, which includes Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson, and had $19.6 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We offer these services for retirement plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to our managed account programs, which are quantitative systems that select investment options and make retirement planning choices for the participants.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe retirement plan participants will continue to adopt managed accounts because of the complexity involved in retirement planning.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	We also plan to focus on unifying our Retirement Advice capabilities and operations in 2011 to offer our clients the best combination of solutions and capabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios is a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.7 billion in assets under management invested with Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Expand our international brand presence, products, and services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $157.1 million in revenue in 2010 compared with $129.2 million in 2009 and represent an increasing percentage of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our strategy is to expand our non-U.S. operations (either organically or through acquisitions) to meet the increasing demand for wide-ranging, independent investment insight by investors around the globe.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	Because more than half of the world s investable assets are located outside of the United States, we believe there are significant opportunities for us.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	Our strategy is to focus our non-U.S. sales efforts on our major products, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation and Morningstar Direct, as well as opportunities such as real-time data, qualitative investment research and ratings, investment indexes, and consulting.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	We also plan to explore new regions, such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East; continue expanding our databases to be locally and globally comprehensive; introduce new products in markets where we already have operations; and expand our sales and product support infrastructure around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Historically, the majority of our long-term revenue growth has been driven by organic growth as we ve introduced new products and services and expanded our marketing efforts for existing products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	However, we have made and expect to continue making selective acquisitions that support our five growth strategies.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	In reviewing potential acquisitions, we focus on transactions that:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	offer a good strategic fit with our mission of creating great products that help investors reach their financial goals; help us build our proprietary investment databases, research capabilities, technical expertise, or customer base faster and more cost effectively than we could if we built them ourselves; and offer a good cultural fit with our entrepreneurial spirit and brand leadership.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	We paid approximately $102.3 million for seven acquisitions in 2010, as summarized in the table below.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Footnoted business of Financial Fineprint Inc.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Footnoted is a highly regarded blog for professional money managers, analysts, and sophisticated individual investors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Footnoted Pro, a service for institutional investors, provides insight on actionable items and trends in SEC filings.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	A leading provider of independent equity research in Sydney, Australia.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	A web-based service that leverages a proprietary database of more than 1,000 variable annuities that includes plain-English translations of complex but important information found in prospectuses and other public filings.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	*Total purchase price less cash acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	For information about our previous acquisitions, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	We operate our business in two segments:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Investment Information, which includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Investment Management, which includes all of our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	The table below shows our revenue by business segment for each of the past three years:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	For information on segment operating income (loss) and total assets, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Licensed Data, a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases, including real-time pricing data, and available through electronic data feeds; Morningstar Advisor Workstation, a web-based investment planning system for independent financial advisors as well as advisors affiliated with larger firms; Morningstar.com, which includes both Premium Memberships and Internet advertising sales; Morningstar Direct, a web-based institutional research platform; and Morningstar Site Builder and Licensed Tools, services that help institutional clients build customized websites or enhance their existing sites with Morningstar s online tools and components.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Investment Information segment also includes Logical Information Machines, Inc. (LIM), an analytical software service we acquired at the end of 2009 that aggregates financial and energy data from a large number of sources.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	LIM delivers a comprehensive, real-time solution for research, analysis, and trading for institutional clients and lets clients query these multiple data sets simultaneously.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	The majority of LIM s clients are in the energy and commodities industries.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Other major products within the Investment Information segment include equity and credit research, fund research, Realpoint s research on commercial mortgage-backed securities, and our Enterprise Data Management business, which helps institutions outsource certain business operations to Morningstar, including creating investment profiles, aggregating account data, performance reporting, and consolidating and managing data feeds from multiple sources.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	We also offer a variety of financial communications materials, real-time data and desktop software, investment software for financial advisors and institutions, and investment indexes, as well as several print and online publications.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	In 2010, 31.8% of Investment Information segment revenue was from outside of the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Most of our products for individual investors target investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing and investors who seek out third-party sources to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial planners.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	We sell our advisor-related products both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing enterprise to use our products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Our institutional clients include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan sponsors and providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	We also have data reselling agreements with third-party providers of investment tools and applications, allowing us to increase the distribution of our data with minimal additional cost.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	We believe the Investment Information segment has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	We ve historically had higher revenue in the second quarter because we hold an investment conference then.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	Other products in this segment generally have not shown marked seasonality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our largest customer in the Investment Information segment made up approximately 2% of segment revenue in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our Licensed Data service gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	We offer data packages of proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, and ownership.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	Institutions can use Licensed Data in a variety of investor communications, including websites, print publications, and marketing fact sheets, as well as for internal research and product development.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P70_S3	We deliver Licensed Data through electronic data feeds and provide daily updates to clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P70_S4	Pricing for Licensed Data is based on the number of funds or other securities covered, the amount of information provided for each security, and the level of distribution.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	In 2010, we launched a new client-facing data delivery platform and introduced other tools to facilitate clients access to the most current data.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	We also reduced our data file delivery times and globalized our Essentials platform by adding qualitative fund ratings and data on European hedge funds.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	For Licensed Data, our primary competitors are Bloomberg, Europerformance, FactSet Research Systems, Financial Express, Interactive Data Corporation, Standard Poor s, and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Licensed Data was our largest product in 2010 and accounted for 17.7%, 19.1%, and 15.6% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	Our largest customer in the Investment Management segment made up approximately 18% of segment revenue in 2010.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P136_S3	We emphasize contracts where we re paid a percentage of assets under management for ongoing investment management and consulting, as opposed to one-time relationships where we re paid a flat fee.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	Morningstar Associates also launched a strategic relationship with a major online broker to provide asset-allocation services and model portfolios of mutual funds and ETFs for its advisory platform.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	In addition, Morningstar Associates introduced a new variable-annuity fund-of-funds program with a key client in 2010, representing approximately $39 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	To help retirement plan sponsors meet their fiduciary duties, Ibbotson developed a website specifically for its plan sponsor consulting services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	The site helps plan sponsors gather the data and information ithey need to meet their fiduciary responsibilities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	We expanded our Investment Consulting business outside the United States with two acquisitions in 2010:

1289419_11_ITEM1_P144_S2	In 2009, we acquired Intech Pty Ltd, a leading provider of multimanager and investment portfolio solutions in Sydney, Australia.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P144_S3	We rebranded Intech under the Ibbotson name in February 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	Our Investment Consulting business competes primarily with Mercer, Mesirow Financial, Russell Investments, Watson Wyatt, and Wilshire Associates, as well as some smaller firms in the retirement consulting business and various in-house providers of investment advisory services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	Pricing for the consulting services we provide through Morningstar Associates and Ibbotson Associates is based on the scope of work and the level of service required.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	In the majority of our contracts, we receive asset-based fees, reflecting our work as a portfolio construction manager or subadvisor for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	Investment Consulting was our second-largest product based on revenue in 2010 and accounted for 13.1%, 13.1%, and 15.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	We have two Retirement Advice offerings that help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement: Morningstar Retirement Manager (offered by Morningstar Associates) and Advice by Ibbotson (offered by Ibbotson Associates).
1289419_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	We plan to combine some of their capabilities during 2011 to simplify our product lineup and offer clients the best combination of products and solutions to meet their needs.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	Morningstar Retirement Manager is designed to help retirement plan participants determine how much to invest and which investments are most appropriate for their portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	It gives guidance explaining whether participants suggested plans are on target to meet their retirement goals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P149_S2	As part of this service, we deliver personalized recommendations for a target savings goal, a recommended contribution rate to help achieve that goal, a portfolio mix based on risk tolerance, and specific fund recommendations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	Morningstar Retirement Manager includes a managed account service designed for plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to Morningstar s investment professionals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	In 2010, we enhanced the Retirement Manager interface to make it easier for participants to enter information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P150_S3	We also expanded Retirement Manager to provide advisory services to individuals who are in retirement and redesigned our personalized retirement strategy report to make it more engaging to participants.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	As of December 31, 2010, approximately 13.4 million plan participants had access to Morningstar Retirement Manager through approximately 82,000 plan sponsors and 16 plan providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	Pricing for Morningstar Retirement Manager depends on the number of participants, as well as the level of service we provide.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	Advice by Ibbotson offers a set of services and proprietary software to give retirement plan participants access to investment education, self-service advice, and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers and directly to plan sponsors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	The platform includes installed software advice solutions that can be co-branded by retirement plan sponsors and providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P153_S3	Advice by Ibbotson combines asset allocation and patented human capital methodologies that help participants determine how to prepare for retirement based on their financial assets as well as their future earnings and savings power.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P153_S4	Advice by Ibbotson s customized software can be integrated with existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	In 2010, Ibbotson Associates expanded its target-maturity portfolio construction service with several additional plan sponsors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	Ibbotson also integrated its Lifetime Advice Methodology into a new advisory wrap program for advisors and institutions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P154_S2	The program offers fund selection, asset allocation, and product allocation advice (including life insurance, immediate payout annuities, and tax-deferred annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits).
1289419_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	In addition, Ibbotson added new capabilities to the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine and the Advice by Ibbotson program to quantitatively determine the best investment choice among pre-tax deferred accounts, post-tax deferred accounts, and taxable accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P155_S1	For example, Ibbotson can now advise an investor to invest in a Roth 401(k) account versus a pre-tax 401(k) account.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P155_S2	It also enhanced the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine to accommodate the local United Kingdom tax code, pension rules, mortality expectations, and regulatory rules.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	As of December 31, 2010, approximately 10.1 million plan participants had access to Advice by Ibbotson through approximately 68,000 plan sponsors and seven plan providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	Pricing for Advice by Ibbotson depends on the number of participants, as well as the level of service we provide.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	In the retirement advice market, we compete primarily with Financial Engines, Guided Choice, and ProManage.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	The Morningstar Managed Portfolios program is offered through Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., a registered investment advisor, registered broker-dealer, member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	This program is only available through financial advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	Our team of investment professionals uses a disciplined process for asset allocation, fund selection, and portfolio construction.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	They actively monitor the portfolios and make adjustments as needed.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P162_S1	We charge asset-based fees for Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P162_S2	The management fee is based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s average daily portfolio balance.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P162_S4	We charge 55 basis points for the Select Stock Baskets, which are a managed account service consisting of individually customized stock portfolios based on Morningstar s proprietary indexes and independent equity research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	In 2010, Morningstar Investment Services introduced a new Strategist Series portfolio designed to track the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P163_S2	Morningstar Investment Services also added a Client Review Packet feature, a Roth IRA Conversion Calculator, and re-engineered its client risk-profiling questionnaire and recommendations engine.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P165_S0	We promote our print, software, web-based products and services, and consulting services with a staff of sales and marketing professionals, as well as an in-house public relations team.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P165_S1	Our marketing staff includes both product specialists and a corporate marketing group that manages company initiatives.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P165_S2	Our sales team includes several strategic account managers who oversee all aspects of our largest institutional client relationships.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P165_S3	We also have a sales operations staff, which focuses on tracking and forecasting sales and other tasks to support our sales team.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	See Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning revenue from customers and long-lived assets from our business operations outside the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	In addition, we hold minority ownership positions in operating companies based in Japan and Sweden.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we owned a minority ownership position (approximately 34% of the outstanding shares) in Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) and our share had a market value of approximately $38.4 million.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	To enable these companies to do business in their designated territories, we provide them with the rights to the Morningstar name and logo and with access to certain of our products and technology.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	Each company is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its country and working with Morningstar s data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases, develop new products, and enhance existing products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our business operations outside of the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	We try to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P170_S2	For example, in the normal course of business, we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P170_S3	We use these agreements to define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we maintain operating companies.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P171_S1	As we move into new countries, we consider adding to these registrations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P171_S2	In some jurisdictions, we also register certain product identifiers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P171_S3	We have registered our name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in several other countries.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are registered marks of Morningstar in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P172_S1	The table below includes some of the trademarks and service marks that we use:
1289419_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P173_S1	We believe these patents represent our commitment to developing innovative products and tools for investors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P174_S0	In the majority of our licensing agreements, we license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P174_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P175_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with our minority-owned operations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P175_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to develop and market similar products under our name in their operating territories.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P176_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P176_S1	We license some of this intellectual property from third parties and obtain other portions of it directly from public filings.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P177_S0	We believe our business has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P177_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as the Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook and one of our investment conferences, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P177_S2	Most of our products are sold with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P177_S3	This tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P178_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P178_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P179_S0	In 2010, our largest customer accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P180_S0	The economic and financial information industry has been marked by increased consolidation over the past five years, with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P180_S1	Some of our major competitors include Thomson Reuters; Standard Poor s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; Bloomberg; and Yahoo!.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P180_S2	These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P180_S3	We also have a number of smaller competitors in our two business segments, which we discuss in Business Segments, Products, and Services above.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P181_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment analysis and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P182_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P182_S1	We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P182_S2	We have a flexible technology platform that allows our products to work together across a full range of investment databases, delivery formats, and market segments.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P182_S3	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P182_S4	This allows us to control our development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P183_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our technology team consisted of approximately 800 programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P184_S0	In 2010, 2009, and 2008 our development expense represented 8.9%, 8.0%, and 8.0%, respectively, of our revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P184_S1	We expect that development expense will continue to represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue in the future.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P187_S0	In addition, because these four subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_11_ITEM1_P187_S1	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P188_S0	Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and a member of FINRA.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P188_S1	The regulation of broker-dealers has, to a large extent, been delegated by the federal securities laws to self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P188_S2	Subject to approval by the SEC, FINRA adopts rules that govern its members.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P189_S0	FINRA conducts periodic examinations of the operations of Morningstar Investment Services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P190_S0	Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales, capital structure, record-keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P190_S1	Violation of applicable regulations can result in the revocation of a broker-dealer license, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm or its officers or employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P191_S0	Morningstar Investment Services is subject to certain net capital requirements under the Exchange Act.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P191_S1	The net capital requirements, which specify minimum net capital levels for registered broker-dealers, are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P192_S0	Realpoint, LLC, one of our subsidiaries, is an NRSRO specializing in structured finance.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P192_S1	As an NRSRO, Realpoint is subject to the requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P196_S0	We have a variety of other entities (in Japan, Korea, Thailand, and France) that are registered with their respective regulatory bodies; however, the amount of business conducted by these entities related to the registration is relatively small.

1289419_11_ITEM1_P214_S3	He holds a bachelor s degree in industrial design from The Ohio State University and a master s degree in fine arts from the Yale University School of Art.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P215_S0	We were incorporated in Illinois on May 16, 1984.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P215_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P216_S0	We maintain a website at http://corporate.morningstar.com .
1289419_11_ITEM1_P216_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P216_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P216_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P216_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P217_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P217_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P217_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P218_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P218_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S0	We believe that independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S1	We offer products and services to our institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S2	Our institutional clients have generated a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue in recent years.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S3	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S4	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S5	The fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services, as well as the fact that in some cases we make investment recommendations within the framework of client constraints, may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S6	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P219_S7	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P220_S0	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us (either intentionally or inadvertently) could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P221_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P222_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may adversely impact our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P223_S0	Although market conditions improved in 2009 and 2010, we believe that ongoing economic weakness continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on consumer discretionary spending.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P223_S1	The financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 also led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies, which make up a large percentage of our client base.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P223_S2	Some institutional clients also implemented additional review processes for new contracts or began to provide certain services, particularly investment advisory services, in-house rather than hiring external service providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P224_S0	If financial markets around the world experience negative performance and volatility, demand for our products and services may decline, and our revenue, operating income, and other financial results could suffer.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P224_S1	Our business results may also be impacted by negative trends in Internet advertising sales.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P224_S2	The financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, which are beyond our control.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P225_S0	Our revenue from asset-based fees may be impacted by market declines as well as the impact of cash outflows.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P226_S0	In 2010, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P226_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P226_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P226_S3	The size of these portfolios can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P226_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory services goes down, we expect that our fee-based revenue will show a corresponding decline.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P227_S0	Our investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P228_S0	Our investment advisory operations involve fiduciary obligations that require us to act in the best interests of our clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P228_S1	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P228_S2	We may not be able to prevent clients from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P228_S3	Because we provided investment advisory services on more than $107.2 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010, we could face substantial liabilities if we breach our fiduciary duties.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P229_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P230_S0	Changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory operations, compliance failures, or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P231_S0	Our investment advisory operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P231_S1	Our acquisitions of Ibbotson Associates in 2006 and Intech Pty Ltd in 2009 substantially increased our business in this area.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P231_S2	We also expanded our investment advisory operations with our recent acquisitions of Old Broad Street Research Ltd. in the United Kingdom and Seeds Group in France.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P232_S0	The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P232_S1	The activities of our investment advisory operations are primarily subject to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_11_ITEM1_P232_S2	In addition, our investment management business is conducted through a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P233_S0	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations may be subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P233_S1	It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P233_S2	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P233_S3	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P234_S0	The increasing concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative impact on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P235_S0	We now have approximately 820 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fourth of our total workforce.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P235_S1	Over the past several years, we have moved a significant percentage of our data collection and development operations to this location.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P236_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, we cannot predict the level of political and regulatory risk that may affect our operations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P236_S1	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P236_S2	Any difficulties that we face in successfully maintaining our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide, particularly because of our increasing reliance on this facility.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P237_S0	We have approximately 270 employees who work at our data collection facilities in Mumbai and New Delhi, India, which may also be subject to political and regulatory risk.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P237_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P238_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may negatively impact our competitive position and business results.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P239_S0	We attribute much of our company s success over the past 25 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P239_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will continue to successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P239_S2	If tools similar to Morningstar s proprietary tools become more broadly available through other channels, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P240_S0	Failing to successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P241_S0	We ve completed numerous acquisitions over the past three years, including seven acquisitions in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P241_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate the employees, product lines, business systems, marketing and branding, or other operations following any acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P241_S2	We expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P242_S0	Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve a number of risks.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P242_S1	They can be time-consuming and may divert management s attention from day-to-day operations, particularly if numerous acquisitions are in process at the same time.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P242_S2	Financing an acquisition could result in dilution to our shareholders from the issuance of equity securities, reduce our financial flexibility because of reductions in our cash balance, or result in a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P243_S0	Acquisitions might also result in losing key employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P243_S1	We may fail to successfully complete an acquisition, investment, or joint venture.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P243_S2	We may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from an acquisition to earn a return on the associated purchase price.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P244_S0	Our operations outside of the United States are expanding and involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P245_S0	Our operations outside of the United States have expanded to $157.1 million in revenue in 2010 from $129.2 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P245_S1	Several of our recent acquisitions have added to our business operations in Europe, Australia, and other areas outside the United States, and we recently established a business presence in Latin America.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S0	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S1	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S2	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S3	We don t engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S4	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P246_S5	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, our financial results are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P247_S0	A prolonged outage of our database and network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other office equipment, which are mainly located in our Chicago headquarters or elsewhere in the Chicago area.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S2	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures or disruptions, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control, including disasters affecting Chicago.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S3	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S4	We re not currently able to immediately switch over all of our systems to a back-up facility.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S5	If we experience a significant database or network facility outage, our business may be disrupted until we fully implement our back-up systems.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P248_S6	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P249_S0	Our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P249_S1	Any failures or disruptions could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P250_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P250_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or increased government regulation.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P250_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P251_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about our users.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P252_S0	Customers routinely input personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P252_S1	We also handle personally sensitive information through our Portfolio Management Service, managed retirement accounts, and other areas of our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P252_S2	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user s personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user s name, address, portfolio holdings, or credit card information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P252_S3	Any such event could subject us to claims for unauthorized credit card purchases, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, or claims for other misuses of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing or unauthorized access to personal portfolio information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P253_S0	Certain products and services have historically made up a large percentage of our revenue base.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P253_S1	Our business could suffer if sales of these products and services decline.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P254_S0	In 2010, our five largest products based on revenue (Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar.com, and Morningstar Direct) accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P254_S1	We believe that sales of these products and services will continue to make up a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue for the foreseeable future.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P254_S2	If we experience a significant decline in sales of any of these products for any reason, it would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and could harm our business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P255_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P256_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on corporate credit issuers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P256_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P256_S2	We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P257_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P257_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P257_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P257_S3	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P258_S0	We may be unable to generate adequate returns on our cash and investment balance if we cannot identify attractive investment opportunities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P259_S0	We held a total of $365.4 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P260_S0	Because of generally low prevailing interest rates on high-quality fixed-income securities, the rate of return we can generate with our cash and investment balance is relatively low.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P260_S1	We have used portions of our cash and investment balance to finance acquisitions over the past several years.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P260_S2	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities in the future.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P260_S3	As mentioned above, we may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from an acquisition to earn a return on the associated purchase price.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P261_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry experiences slower growth.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P262_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is generated from products and services related to mutual funds.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P263_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 25 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P263_S1	Global mutual fund assets declined to about $23.7 trillion as of September 30, 2010, down from a peak of $26.1 trillion in 2007.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P263_S2	While mutual fund assets rose in 2010, equity-focused funds have continued to experience net cash outflows, suggesting that investors remain cautious about equity-related assets.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P264_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P265_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could reduce investor interest and investment activity in this area.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P265_S1	A slower growth rate or downturn in mutual fund assets could decrease demand for our products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P265_S2	Competition could reduce our share of the investment research market and hurt our financial performance.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P266_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment research providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P266_S1	We compete with many different types of companies that vary in size, product scope, and media focus, including large and well-established distributors of financial information, such as Thomson Reuters; Standard Poor s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; Bloomberg; and Yahoo!.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P266_S2	We compete with a variety of other companies in different areas of our business, which we discuss in greater detail in the Business Segments, Products, and Services section in Item 1 Business.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P267_S0	Many of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P267_S1	This may allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for products and services, devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services, and make more attractive offers to potential clients, subscribers, and strategic partners.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P267_S2	Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P267_S3	Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P268_S0	The investment information industry is dominated by a few large players, and industry consolidation has increased in the past several years.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P268_S1	If providers of data and investment analysis continue to consolidate, our competitive position may suffer.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P269_S0	Consolidation among our clients may adversely impact our competitive position, our relationships with our clients, and business results.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P270_S0	Industry consolidation in the financial services sector has accelerated over the past several years.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P270_S1	We can t predict the impact on our business if one of our clients is acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P270_S2	We may lose business following an acquisition of one of our clients if we re not able to continue providing services or expand our business with the combined organization.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P270_S3	Any loss of business because of increased consolidation could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P271_S0	The availability of free or low-cost investment information could lead to lower demand for our products and adversely affect our financial results.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P272_S0	Investment research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds is widely available for little or no cost from various sources, including the Internet and public libraries.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P272_S1	Investors can also access information directly from publicly traded companies and mutual funds.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P273_S0	The Interactive Data Electronic Applications (IDEA) database available through the SEC website provides real-time access to SEC filings, including annual, semi-annual, and quarterly reports.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P273_S1	Financial information and data is also widely available in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), and many brokerage firms provide financial and investment research to their clients.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P274_S0	The widespread availability of free or low-cost investment information may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase the prices we charge for our publications and services and could lead to a lower demand for our products.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P274_S1	A loss of a significant number of customers would hurt our financial results.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P274_S2	We could be subject to fines, penalties, or other sanctions as a result of an investigation by the New York Attorney General s Office related to some of the services Morningstar Associates, LLC provides.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P275_S0	As we originally disclosed in 2004, the New York Attorney General s Office is conducting an investigation related to some of the products and services offered by Morningstar Associates, LLC.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P275_S1	See Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a description of these matters.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P275_S2	We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of these matters, which may include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P275_S3	We also cannot predict what impact, if any, these matters may have on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P275_S4	We have not established any reserves relating to these matters.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P276_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P277_S0	We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P277_S1	These organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P277_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P278_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P278_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P278_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P278_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P278_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P279_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P280_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P280_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P280_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers, or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P280_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P281_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P281_S1	It is possible that our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P281_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P281_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P282_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P283_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 50% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P283_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P283_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P283_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P284_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively impact our stock price.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S2	A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs, office leases, and other infrastructure spending, which generally cannot be adjusted quickly.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S3	Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S4	If actual revenue falls below our expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S5	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S6	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S7	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P285_S8	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P286_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P286_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P286_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P286_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P286_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P287_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P288_S0	In the past, we ve granted options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P288_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P288_S2	As of December 31, 2010, our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 1,856,425 shares of common stock, all of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $17.73 per share.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P288_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there were 822,855 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 33 months.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P289_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P289_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and shares are issued when restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P289_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P290_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P290_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P290_S2	Stock option exercises, share repurchases, and other factors may create volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P291_S0	Part of our cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P291_S1	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised if the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise) exceeds the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P291_S2	Similarly, excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock at vesting is greater than the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P291_S3	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P292_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be realized.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P292_S1	Because of this uncertainty, there may be additional volatility in our cash flows from financing activities.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P292_S2	In addition, our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P292_S3	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that management deems appropriate.
1289419_11_ITEM1_P292_S4	Changes in the amount of repurchase activity from period to period may also cause volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we lease approximately 323,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our office located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 385,000 square feet of office space in 23 countries around the world.
1289419_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In November 2010, InvestPic, LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Morningstar, Inc. and several other companies alleging that each defendant infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,349,291, which relates to methods for performing statistical analysis on investment data and displaying the analyzed data in graphical form.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	InvestPic seeks, among other things, unspecified damages because of defendants alleged infringing activities and costs.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	Morningstar is evaluating the lawsuit but cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Realpoint for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones s request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar s corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	Realpoint and Morningstar continue to vigorously contest liability on all of Egan-Jones claims for damages.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson s prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Business Logic is alleging that Ibbotson Associates and Morningstar violated Business Logic s rights by using its trade secrets to develop a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson Associates are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	In December 2004, Morningstar Associates, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc., received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General s office seeking information and documents related to an investigation the New York Attorney General s office is conducting.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	The subpoena asks for documents relating to the investment consulting services the company offers to retirement plan providers, including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	Morningstar Associates has provided the requested information and documents.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	In 2005, Morningstar Associates received subpoenas seeking information and documents related to investigations being conducted by the SEC and United States Department of Labor.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	The subpoenas were similar in scope to the New York Attorney General subpoena.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	In January 2007 and September 2009, respectively, the SEC and Department of Labor each notified Morningstar Associates that it had ended its investigation, with no enforcement action, fines, or penalties.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	In January 2007, Morningstar Associates received a Notice of Proposed Litigation from the New York Attorney General s office.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Notice centers on disclosure relating to an optional service offered to retirement plan sponsors (employers) that select 401(k) plan services from ING, one of Morningstar Associates clients.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P8_S2	The Notice gave Morningstar Associates the opportunity to explain why the New York Attorney General s office should not institute proceedings.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P8_S3	Morningstar Associates promptly submitted its explanation and has cooperated fully with the New York Attorney General s office.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of this matter, which may include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P9_S1	We also cannot predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P10_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_11_ITEM3_P10_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

1289419_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities may also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	See Note 11 in our Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made during the three months ended December 31, 2010:
1289419_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	* Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	(1) In September 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	The share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2012.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P9_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_11_ITEM5_P9_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P9_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 1, 2011:
1289419_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	During the fourth quarter, Steve Kaplan s and Richard Robbins previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plans expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P10_S1	Cheryl Francis, Liz Kirscher, and David Williams amended their Rule 10b5-1 sales plans.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P10_S2	Patrick Reinkemeyer and Tao Huang left the company in December 2010 and January 2011, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P10_S3	Therefore, their Rule 10b5-1 sales plans have been removed from the table.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	(1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares each identified director and executive officer will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans identified above.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P11_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2010, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2011 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P11_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM5_P11_S3	Each director and executive officer identified in the table may amend or terminate his or her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as restated, that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	In 2010, we determined that the cumulative effect of adjustments related to prior periods were material, in aggregate, if recorded in our 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	These amounts related primarily to our accounting for deferred taxes and, to a lesser extent, to expense adjustments associated with vacant office space and rent for one of our office leases.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	We evaluated the effects of these errors on our prior periods Consolidated Financial Statements, individually and in the aggregate, in accordance with the materiality guidance provided by the SEC staff, as included in SAB Topics 1M and 1N, and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S3	However, in accordance with the provisions of these SAB Topics, we restated our Consolidated Financial Statements for years prior to 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S4	See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the restated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P1_S5	The following table reconciles the amounts as presented in this table of Selected Financial Data with the previously reported amounts:
1289419_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations (organic revenue) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
1289419_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1289419_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)).
1289419_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P3_S2	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P3_S3	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock in conjunction with the acquisition of Realpoint, LLC.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	The restricted stock vests over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P4_S2	This grant resulted in an expense of $1.2 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	The total expense for stock-based compensation is distributed with other employee compensation costs in the appropriate operating expense categories of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P5_S1	Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based compensation.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	Cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions; purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments; and capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P6_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P6_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P7_S1	These cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program which we began in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P7_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P8_S0	Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P8_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P8_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P8_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P8_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P9_S0	We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_11_ITEM6_P9_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others, general industry conditions and competition, including current global financial uncertainty; the impact of market volatility on revenue from asset-based fees; damage to our reputation resulting from claims made about possible conflicts of interest; liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties; financial services industry consolidation; a prolonged outage of our database and network facilities; challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations; and the availability of free or low-cost investment information.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We offer an extensive line of data, software, and research products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	We also offer asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Morningstar has two operating segments: Investment Information and Investment Management.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	These products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Investment Management segment includes our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and marketing our existing products.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	However, we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions that support our five key growth strategies, which are:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Enhance our position in key market segments by focusing on our three major Internet-based platforms; Create a premier global investment database; Continue building thought leadership in independent investment research; Become a global leader in fund-of-funds investment management; and Expand our international brand presence, products, and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We sell many of our offerings, such as newsletters, Principia software, and Premium service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Several of our other products are sold through license agreements, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Equity Research, Morningstar Direct, Retirement Advice, and Licensed Data.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	For some of our other institutional services, mainly Investment Consulting, we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We also earn fees relating to Morningstar Managed Portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Overall, revenue tied to asset-based fees accounted for about 12% of our consolidated revenue in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	The businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models, and as a result, we acquired their deferred revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $146.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and $127.1 million as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	We strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments, through multiple media, and in many geographical markets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	In general, our businesses have high fixed costs, and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	We believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower, particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	At times, we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short-term operating results.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	During other periods, our profitability will improve because we re able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P10_S6	When revenue decreases, however, the significant operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold, development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage, printing, and CD-ROM replication, as well as shareholder servicing fees for Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	This category includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	We amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software, which is generally three years, and include this expense in depreciation and amortization.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing programs to promote our products.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team, as well as human resources, finance, and support employees for each segment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs, including corporate systems, finance and accounting, legal, and facilities expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our capital expenditures consist of computers, leasehold improvements, and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	We amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have majority-owned operations in 24 countries outside of the United States and include these in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	We account for our minority-owned investments in Japan and Sweden using the equity method.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows, discounted to their worth in today s dollars.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price, or to take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not be in the long-term interest of building shareholder value.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Organic revenue is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	To evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate a retention rate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We use two different methods for calculating retention.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	For subscription-based products (including our print newsletters, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and Principia software), we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P27_S6	The retention rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Following a strong market rebound in 2009, the U.S. market gained 16.8% in 2010, as measured by Morningstar s U.S. Market Index, a broad market index.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Most global markets also had positive returns for the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Morningstar s Global Ex-U.S. Index rose 12.6%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Total U.S. mutual fund assets rose to $11.8 trillion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $11.1 trillion as of December 31, 2009, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were strong for the year, investors continued to heavily favor fixed-income funds rather than equity funds.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	U.S. stock funds had negative net cash flows for the year, although less so than in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend, with total assets increasing but asset flows favoring fixed-income funds.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The number of mutual funds in the United States continued to contract slightly to about 7,600 in 2010 (excluding multiple share classes) from 7,700 in 2009, based on data from the ICI.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The number of global mutual funds increased to about 69,000 as of September 30, 2010, compared with 66,000 as of September 30, 2009, based on ICI data.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We estimate that hedge funds included in Morningstar s database had about $3 billion in net inflows through November 30, 2010, compared with $51 billion in net outflows for the same period in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2010 with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management based on Morningstar s data, up from about $780 billion at the end of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Based on data from Nielsen/Net Ratings, aggregate page views and the time spent per visit for financial and investment sites in 2010 both declined by about 20% compared with 2009, while the number of unique visitors was down about 10%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	We believe these trends reflect individual investors lower level of interest in financial- and investment-related content in the wake of the market downturn.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Metrics such as pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit also declined for Morningstar.com in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Despite these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies rose sharply in 2010 after reductions in 2008 and 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Magna, a division of Interpublic Group, estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about 7% across all industries in 2010, following a 3% decline in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the wake of the global financial crisis, regulators continued to implement new rules for financial services companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	One of the significant developments in Asia last year was the introduction of new regulations and requirements to enforce additional risk disclosures on investment products.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Regulators introduced new documents such as the Key Facts Statements in Hong Kong and Product Highlights Sheets in Singapore in 2010 to enhance product transparency and to set an overall disclosure standard for investment product documents.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	We ve continue to enhance our database and products to help our clients meet these new regulations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In Australia, there are numerous regulatory reviews underway related to industry-wide standards for the superannuation industry, as well as fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	While we expect these reviews to put pressure on pricing for product providers and result in further consolidation, we believe the superannuation guarantee rates will support continued asset growth.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	We believe these trends, along with an emphasis on independent research, continue to make Australia an attractive market for Morningstar and other third-party research providers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the European Union, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is a set of EU Directives designed to enable funds to operate across the EU based upon authorization from one state regulator.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	UCITS IV, approved by the European Parliament in January 2009 and coming into effect in July 2011, is largely designed to reduce inefficiencies that exist within the current UCITS III framework.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The directive includes several key sections, including requirements for a new Key Investor Information Document (KIID), an easy-to-read annual factsheet that replaces the Simplified Prospectus.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Every UCITS fund that is promoted to retail investors will have to produce a KID and issue an updated copy within the first 25 business days of each calendar year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	We ve developed prototype documents for the KID and expect to begin providing this service in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	We re also monitoring the EU Transparency Directive.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	One of the key features of this piece of legislation concerns the disclosure of significant holdings of and by companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	This Directive has contributed to our expansion of the global ownership database, with additional coverage in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	We are reviewing the newly published EU Commission report on the Directive and potential revisions to the major shareholder obligations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The United Kingdom s Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and an emphasis on whole of market investment solutions, is scheduled to come into effect at the end of 2012.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Because advisors will be obligated to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias, we believe it may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types, which we offer through products such as Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act into law in July 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Act creates a number of new regulatory, supervisory, and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of U.S. financial markets and activities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Act also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action, giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	As a result, the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Aside from corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to all public companies generally, we believe the portion of the Act that is the most relevant to Morningstar is subtitle C of Title IX, which contains changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	This section subjects Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including Realpoint, the subsidiary we acquired in May 2010, to greater oversight by the SEC.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	Among other things, it requires the SEC to remove the current exemption in Regulation FD for credit rating agencies, allows investors to bring private rights of action against credit rating agencies for failing to conduct a reasonable investigation of the facts or to obtain analysis from an independent source, and repeals Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act of 1933, which exempted credit rating agencies from being considered experts subject to liability for ratings included in registration statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	However, the SEC issued a no-action letter regarding the repeal of Rule 436(g) and extended the letter indefinitely.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Aside from subtitle C and the general corporate governance and disclosure requirements, we believe the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations will not have a direct effect on Morningstar.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	However, we continue to monitor the potential impact of these regulations on our clients.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	For example, the SEC recently recommended that regulators adopt rules requiring that broker-dealers be subject to a fiduciary standard, which would impose additional requirements on commission-based advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Overall, we believe the uncertainty in the financial services sector continued easing throughout 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	With the exception of continued weakness in consumer discretionary spending, business trends steadily improved during the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	As discussed in more detail in the Consolidated Operating Income section below, during 2010 we continued phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation-related expenses we previously reduced.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The list below summarizes the key accomplishments and challenges that our management team has highlighted related to our 2010 performance:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We made solid progress building a base for our credit research business and now offer credit ratings and reports on more than 720 corporate credit issuers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	We acquired Realpoint, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization that specializes in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	We expanded our analyst research and investment consulting work on exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, alternative investments, 529 plans, and target-date funds all areas that have seen strong investor interest.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	We continued to expand our equity research business, doubling our client base in just one year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	We continued building out our global operations, establishing a presence in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Luxembourg.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	We also expanded our international investment research and consulting businesses by acquiring Aegis, Seeds Group, and OBSR.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Morningstar Direct had a record year with more than 1,200 new licenses added globally.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Both renewal rates for contract-based products and services and retention rates for subscription products rose substantially compared with 2009, reflecting improved business conditions and healthier sales trends across most of our product lines.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Morningstar s board of directors approved a 5 cent per share initial quarterly dividend and a $100 million share repurchase program, allowing us to return a portion of our cash balance to shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Operating expense rose faster than revenue in 2010, leading to a 4.2 percentage point decline in our operating margin, in part because we restored some incentive compensation and benefits after reducing them in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	We have more work to do in fully integrating some of our acquisitions and rebranding many of these businesses under the Morningstar umbrella.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	While advertising sales on Morningstar.com rebounded strongly U.S. Premium Membership subscriptions were 8% lower year over year as individual investors have been slow to return to the stock market and remain cautious about discretionary spending.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	In 2010, we determined that the cumulative effect of adjustments related to prior periods were material, in aggregate, if recorded in our 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	These amounts related primarily to our accounting for deferred taxes and, to a lesser extent, to expense adjustments associated with vacant office space and rent for one of our office leases.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	We evaluated the effects of these errors on our prior periods Consolidated Financial Statements, individually and in the aggregate, in accordance with the materiality guidance provided by the SEC staff, as included in SAB Topics 1M and 1N, and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	However, in accordance with the provisions of these SAB Topics, we restated our Consolidated Financial Statements, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	Please see Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the restated financial information.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	As noted in How We Evaluate Our Business , we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Please refer to the discussion on page 49 for more detail.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years, comparing our financial results from year to year is complex.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	To make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods, we provide information on both revenue from acquisitions and organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding revenue from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	We include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for 12 months after we complete the acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	After that, we include it as part of our organic revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Consolidated organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The table below shows the periods in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	In 2010, our consolidated revenue increased 15.9% to $555.4 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	We had $47.9 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year, mainly reflecting additional revenue from Logical Information Machines, Inc. (LIM), Realpoint LLC (Realpoint), Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR), and Intech Pty Limited (Intech).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	Acquisitions contributed about 10 percentage points to our consolidated revenue growth.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations, consolidated revenue increased by about $24.1 million, or 5.0%, in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Higher revenue from Morningstar.com advertising sales, Morningstar Direct, and Licensed Data were the main drivers behind the revenue increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	These positive factors as well as smaller contributions from advisor software and our Investment Management products helped offset the loss of revenue associated with the Global Analyst Research Settlement (GARS), which ended in July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	We had equity research revenue of $12.5 million related to GARS in 2009 that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2009, our consolidated revenue decreased 4.7% to $479.0 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	We had about $29.6 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year, mainly reflecting additional revenue from Tenfore Systems Limited (Tenfore, now referred to as Real-Time Data) as well as 10-K Wizard Technology, LLC (10-K Wizard), the equity research and data business from C.P.M.S. (CPMS), Intech (now referred to as Ibbotson Australia), Fundamental Data Limited (Fundamental Data), and others.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	However, this was more than offset by lower organic revenue, largely reflecting a drop in revenue from Investment Consulting as well as lower Equity Research revenue related to GARS in the second half of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	Investment Consulting revenue declined because two clients did not renew their contracts, one in October 2008 and the other in May 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	While organic revenue and acquisitions had the most significant impact on revenue in 2010, we also enjoyed a benefit from foreign currency translations, primarily in the first half of the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar were the primary contributors to the currency benefit, partially offset by the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	In contrast, currency translations reduced revenue by nearly $9.0 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Organic revenue growth improved each quarter in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Revenue from international operations increased as a percentage of total revenue in 2010 and 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our non-U.S. revenue increased to 28.3% of consolidated revenue in 2010, compared with 27.0% in 2009 and 24.2% in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	Several of our recent acquisitions have operations outside the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P75_S3	The majority of our international revenue is from Europe, Australia, and Canada.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P75_S4	Acquisitions contributed $17.0 million to international revenue in 2010 and $23.4 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Foreign currency translations increased revenue by approximately $4.4 million in 2010, reversing the trend from 2009, when foreign currency translations had a negative impact of $9.0 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations, our non-U.S. revenue rose 5.2% in 2010 and declined 5.5% in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our five largest products based on revenue Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar.com, and Morningstar Direct made up about 59% of consolidated revenue in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	While the percentage of revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent over the past three years, the relative size of products within the top five has changed each year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Licensed Data became our largest product in 2008 and has remained in that position in 2010 and 2009, partly because of incremental revenue from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Beginning in 2010, we included revenue from Ibbotson s plan sponsor advice service as Retirement Advice revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	Previously, we included this revenue in Investment Consulting.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	In 2010 and 2009, as a part of the changes to our organizational structure with a focus on our global product lines, we no longer include Morningstar Site Builder as part of Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Site Builder consists of a set of integrated tools, content, and reports that investment firms can seamlessly add to their existing advisor websites.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	In addition, we re continuing to globalize the Premium subscriptions and advertising revenue generated by Morningstar.com websites, which operate in a variety of markets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	As a result, we now include advertising revenue for all non-U.S. sites as part of Morningstar.com and have reclassified prior-year product revenue for consistency with current-year presentation.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	These reclassifications did not have any impact on the order of our top five products in 2009 or 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business , we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between 90% and 95% and increased about 13 percentage points from 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The 2009 renewal rate was depressed partly because of the end of the Global Analyst Research Settlement period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	Excluding this factor, the 2010 renewal rate rose about 6 percentage points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	This improvement reflects higher renewal rates for many product lines, including Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, institutional software, and advisor software.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	In 2010, we estimate that our retention rate for subscription-based products, such as Principia, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and print and online newsletters, was on the higher end of the range between 65% and 70%, up from 55% to 60% in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	The change mainly reflects improved retention rates for individual software and Principia.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	In 2010, our consolidated operating expense increased $80.0 million, or 22.6%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	We completed seven acquisitions in 2010 and six in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	Because of the timing of these acquisitions, our results include operating expense that did not exist in the same periods last year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	Incremental operating expense from acquired businesses represented more than half of the operating expense increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P87_S4	In 2010, we restored some compensation and employee benefits after reducing them in 2009, contributing to the operating expense increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Higher salary expense represented slightly more than one-third of the total operating expense increase, reflecting higher headcount from acquisitions and filling open positions, as well as salary increases made in July 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	We had approximately 3,225 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2010, a 23.8% increase from 2,605 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	We added about 125 employees through acquisitions over the 12 months ending December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	The remainder of the increase in headcount mainly reflects continued hiring for our development centers in China and India.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately 40% of the overall operating expense increase in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	In early 2010, we began phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation-related expense we reduced in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	As a result, bonus expense increased $16.3 million, or 77.6%, in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	Sales commissions increased $7.8 million in 2010, reflecting improved sales activity compared with 2009 as well as a change to one of our commission plans.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	Matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States increased $3.5 million in 2010 because we partially reinstated this employee benefit in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S5	In addition, healthcare benefit costs rose $2.8 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P90_S6	Operating expense in 2010 also included $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Intangible amortization expense increased $5.9 million compared with 2009, reflecting additional amortization expense from recent acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	While operating expense generally increased in 2010, we recorded $9.5 million of operating expense in 2009 related to adjusting the treatment of some incentive stock options and penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	In addition, the recorded expense related to increasing liabilities for vacant office declined by $2.2 million compared with the amount recorded in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points in 2010, as the 22.6% increase in operating expense outpaced the 15.9% increase in revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our consolidated operating expense decreased $9.3 million, or 2.5%, in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	To better align operating expense with revenue in a challenging business environment, we took a number of steps to reduce costs beginning in 2008, with the largest cutbacks effective January 1, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	We changed our bonus plan in 2009 to reduce bonus expense, our single largest discretionary cost.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	As a result, bonus expense was down about $28.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	The significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	We also suspended matching contributions to our 401(k) program in the United States, which reduced operating expense by about $6.6 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	In addition, we reduced discretionary spending on travel, advertising, and marketing.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	Travel costs were about $4.5 million lower in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	Advertising and marketing costs declined by $4.3 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	In addition, we discontinued three publications previously published, which contributed to lower marketing expense in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The positive impact of these cost reductions was partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	We completed six acquisitions in 2009 and six in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Because of the timing of these acquisitions, our 2009 results include operating expense that did not exist in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	Headcount and salary expense increased year over year, partly because of incremental employees added through acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	We had approximately 2,605 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2009, a 9.7% increase from 2,375 employees as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	We added approximately 170 employees through acquisitions over the 12 months ending December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	The remainder of the increase in headcount reflects continued hiring for our development center in China.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The cost reductions we implemented in 2009 were offset by a total of $9.5 million of operating expense for two separate matters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	First, we recorded a $6.1 million operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options that were originally considered incentive stock options (ISOs).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	In 1998, 1999, and 2000, we granted ISOs to many employees.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Upon exercise, ISOs typically have a favorable tax treatment for the employee relative to the tax treatment for non-qualified stock options (NQSOs).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	In 2009, we determined that certain ISOs granted to one former and two current executives should have been treated as NQSOs for the executives and our income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	As a result, Morningstar paid these individuals a total of $4.9 million to compensate for the difference in tax treatment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	We also recorded $1.2 million, primarily for potential penalties related to this matter.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	This $6.1 million expense is included in our operating expense as a general and administrative expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Second, we recorded an operating expense of $3.4 million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The expense impacted each of our operating expense categories, with approximately half recorded as general and administrative expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	For some companies, including Morningstar, it is common practice for taxes withheld on stock-based compensation to be paid with the company s regularly scheduled payroll deposit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	This approach, however, does not technically comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines concerning deposits of taxes withheld in connection with stock-based compensation, which generally require that if a company s cumulative deposit liability for all compensation exceeds $100,000, the tax withholding must be deposited by the following business day.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Transactions related to stock-based compensation frequently cause companies to exceed this threshold outside of their regularly scheduled payroll cycles, thus triggering the accelerated deposit rules.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The subject of tax deposit penalties was part of an IRS audit that began in 2009 and concluded in early 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	We have concluded the matter with the IRS and have increased the frequency of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Operating expense in 2009 also included additional rent expense of $3.2 million to increase a liability related to vacant office space, primarily for the former Ibbotson headquarters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P103_S3	We increased the liability because we anticipated receiving lower sublease income and expected it would take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Despite significant reductions to bonus expense, operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased 1.6 percentage points in 2009, mainly driven by the $9.5 million of incremental operating expense described above and other expense increases.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense, accounting for more than one-third of our total operating expense over the past three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Cost of goods sold rose $28.5 million in 2010 after declining $1.5 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	Approximately 60% of the increase in 2010 was related to recent acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	Higher salaries, bonus expense, and other compensation-related expense also contributed to the increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	The majority of the decline in 2009 was driven by lower bonus expense and lower fulfillment expense, partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Gross margin declined by about 1.4 and 1.0 percentage points in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Development expense increased $10.8 million in 2010 after declining $1.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	The increase in 2010 is mainly because of higher salaries, bonus, and compensation-related expense for our development teams.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	Development expense from recent acquisitions also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	We had approximately 760 employees included in development expense as of December 31, 2010 compared with 540 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S4	In 2010, we capitalized approximately $0.8 million of operating expense for software development, partially offsetting the increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P108_S5	The majority of the decline in 2009 was driven by lower bonus expense, partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	As a percentage of revenue, development cost was up slightly from the same periods in 2009 and 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $23.7 million in 2010, after declining $9.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Higher sales commission expense, which rose $7.8 million in 2010, was the largest factor behind the increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Commission expense rose partly because of improved sales activity.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	In addition, we recognized more expense in 2010 because of a change in our U.S. sales commission structure.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S4	Under this new commission plan, we record the entire commission expense in the quarter in which it is incurred.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S5	Under the previous commission structure, we recognized the commission expense over the term of the customer contract.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P110_S6	Other costs in this category, including salaries and bonuses, and, to a lesser extent, advertising, marketing, and travel, also increased.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Approximately one-fourth of the increase in sales and marketing expense was related to recent acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Sales and marketing expense decreased $9.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	Lower bonus expense and advertising and marketing were the two largest factors driving this change, with each contributing about 40% of the decline.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We reduced advertising and marketing from higher levels in 2008 because of the challenging business environment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	In 2009, we also discontinued three of the publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year Morningstar Funds 500 , Morningstar Stocks 500 , and Morningstar ETFs 150 and therefore didn t incur costs to promote these publications.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	Reduced spending on travel, training, and conferences also contributed to the decrease, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense increased about 2.2 percentage points in 2010, following a slight decrease in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense increased $9.2 million in 2010 following a decline of $1.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	Bonus expense, salaries, and other compensation-related expense contributed to the increase in 2010, as did incremental expense related to acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	G A expense in 2010 also includes $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	While most G A expense rose in 2010, certain G A expense recorded in 2009 did not recur in 2010, including the $6.1 million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options as well as $1.8 million of operating expense recorded to G A expense for the deposit penalty.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Expenses related to liabilities for vacant office space were $2.2 million lower in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	In 2009, G A expense decreased $1.9 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Most of the decline reflects lower bonus expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	Decreases in travel, training, and conferences also contributed to lower expense in this area, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	These cost reductions were partially offset by the operating expense related to the two matters mentioned above, which contributed $7.9 million to general and administrative expense in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	As a percentage of revenue, G A expense decreased 0.8 percentage points in 2010 and increased 0.5 percentage points in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Depreciation expense rose $1.8 million in 2010 and $3.7 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	The increase in 2010 reflects incremental expense from acquisitions and accelerated depreciation expense related to our existing office space in China, in advance of moving into new office space.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	The increase in 2009 was primarily from higher depreciation expense associated with our new corporate headquarters in Chicago.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	Amortization expense increased $5.9 million in 2010 and $2.3 million in 2009, reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.4 percentage points in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	Based on acquisitions completed through December 31, 2010, we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be $25.7 million in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by changes to the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with our 2010 acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Stock-based compensation expense mainly relates to grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) and, beginning in 2010, includes expense related to restricted stock.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs has increased over the past three years, reflecting annual grants.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	We began granting RSUs in May 2006 and have made additional grants each year since then.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	We recognize the expense related to RSUs over the vesting period, which is generally four years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P123_S3	We estimate forfeitures for these awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the second quarter, which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P123_S4	We have not recorded any significant changes to stock-based compensation related to these adjustments.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Restricted Stock: Beginning in 2010, we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of Realpoint.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	This grant resulted in an expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P124_S3	We amortize this value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P124_S4	We have assumed that all of the restricted stock will ultimately vest, and therefore haven t incorporated a forfeiture rate in this portion of our stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Stock options: Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options has declined over the past three years, as stock options granted in previous years were fully vested as of January 1, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is included in each of our operating expense categories, as shown below:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Based on grants made through December 31, 2010, we anticipate that total stock-based compensation expense will be $13.5 million in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	This amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or changes in our estimated forfeiture rate related to these grants.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Bonus expense, which we include in each of our operating expense categories, increased $16.3 million in 2010 after declining $28.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	We reduced our bonus expense in 2009 as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue in the challenging business environment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	In 2010, we reinstated a portion of the bonus expense that was previously reduced.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	Bonus expense for newly acquired operations also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Overall, bonus expense as a percentage of revenue increased about 2.3 percentage points in 2010 and represents about 6.7% of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	In 2009, bonus expense declined to 4.4% of revenue, compared with 9.9% in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	The significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	Prior to 2009, bonus expense represented approximately 10% to 12% of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Instead, the size of the bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items, including changes in full-year operating income relative to the previous year and other factors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	We review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P130_S3	We record bonus expense throughout the year and pay out annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Consolidated operating income fell $3.6 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	While revenue increased $76.4 million, our cost base rose more, leading to lower operating income.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	The decline in operating income reflects higher incentive compensation, including higher bonus expense and sales commissions, modest compensation increases during the second half of 2010, and reinstating some of the employee benefits and other expenses we reduced in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P131_S3	In 2010, costs rose across all of our operating expense categories, with the exception of a $9.5 million operating expense recorded in 2009 that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	With operating expense increasing more than revenue, our operating margin was 4.2 percentage points lower in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	The margin decline mainly reflects higher compensation, bonuses, sales commissions, and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	The loss of revenue from GARS also had a negative effect on margins.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	Acquisitions represented approximately 2 percentage points of the margin decline for the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Consolidated operating income decreased $14.2 million in 2009, as the $23.5 million decline in revenue was partially offset by a $9.3 million reduction in operating expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	We took a number of steps to reduce our cost structure in 2009 mainly by reducing employee benefit costs and bonus expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	We reduced our single largest discretionary cost, bonus expense, by $28.9 million, with changes to the bonus plan in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	We also suspended matching contributions to our 401(k) program in the United States, which accounted for about $6.6 million of expense in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	While we reduced operating expense in several areas with these cost-savings initiatives, we also recorded a total of $9.5 million of unanticipated expense for two separate matters, including $6.1 million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of incentive stock options granted in previous years and $3.4 million of operating expense for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Because operating expense declined at a slower pace than revenue, the 2009 operating margin was down about 1.6 percentage points from 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The $9.5 million of operating expense described above represented about 2 percentage points of the margin decline.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	We generated positive free cash flow in 2010, 2009, and 2008 as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded our level of capital expenditures, as shown below:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Free cash flow increased $19.8 million in 2010 after declining $11.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	Cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures followed similar trends, increasing in 2010 after declining in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Cash provided by operating activities : Cash provided by operating activities increased $22.2 million in 2010, mainly because cash paid in 2010 for bonuses was lower than in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	We made bonus payments of $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $58.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	The positive cash flow impact of a lower bonus payment was partially offset by $4.9 million in payments we made to one former and two current executives related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options (ISOs).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	We recorded the operating expense related to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Cash provided by operating activities decreased $48.1 million in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The decline in cash provided by operating activities reflects a lower cash benefit from accrued compensation as well as an increase of $9.6 million for bonus payments.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	We made bonus payments of $58.9 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with $49.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S3	Bonuses paid in the first quarter of 2009 included $10.0 million in payments deferred from 2007.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S4	We revised our bonus program in January 2009 and no longer defer payment of a portion of bonuses recorded in the prior year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S5	In addition, cash provided by operating activities in 2008 included a $18.9 million benefit from deferred rent, primarily for tenant improvement allowances related to the construction of our new corporate headquarters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S6	This benefit did not recur in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P142_S7	Excess tax benefits declined $17.9 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the number of options exercised and lower average stock prices on the exercise dates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	To provide investors with additional insight into our financial results, we provide a comparison between the change in consolidated net income and the change in cash provided by operating activities:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	In 2010, cash provided by operating activities increased more than consolidated net income.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	The $37.5 million decrease in bonuses paid in 2010 compared with 2009 was the primary driver behind the difference between net income and cash provided by operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	In 2009, cash provided by operating activities declined more than consolidated net income.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	Deferred rent of $18.9 million, primarily for tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build-out of our new headquarters in Chicago, benefited cash flow in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	The tenant improvement allowance received in 2008 is being amortized as a reduction in office lease expense over the lease term and will be deducted from net income to arrive at cash provided by operating activities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P145_S3	The $18.2 million increase in tax payments, the $9.6 million increase in bonuses paid in 2009, and a lower cash flow benefit from accrued compensation, primarily reflecting the reduction in the 2009 bonus expense, also contributed to the difference between net income and cash from operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity, which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	In 2010, 2009, and 2008 we classified $7.5 million, $8.7 million, and $26.6 million of excess tax benefits, respectively, as financing activities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	We describe these excess tax benefits in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	Capital expenditures : We spent $14.8 million for capital expenditures in 2010, primarily for computer hardware and leasehold improvements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	A significant portion of the capital expenditures in 2010 are for new office space in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	This new office facility was substantially completed in early 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	In 2009, capital expenditures were $12.4 million, a decrease of $36.1 million from 2008 mainly because of the timing of payments related to our new corporate headquarters in Chicago.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services, which are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Morningstar Licensed Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar.com, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Site Builder and Licensed Tools, and Morningstar Principia.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Licensed Data is a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases and available through electronic data feeds.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Advisor Workstation is a web-based investment planning system for advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	Advisor Workstation is available in two editions: Morningstar Office for independent financial advisors and an enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	Morningstar.com includes both Premium Memberships and Internet advertising sales.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Morningstar Direct is a web-based institutional research platform.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	Site Builder and Licensed Tools are services that help institutional clients build customized websites or enhance their existing sites with Morningstar s online tools and components.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	Principia is our CD-ROM-based investment research and planning software for advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	The Investment Information segment also includes Morningstar Equity Research, which we distribute through several channels.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	From June 2004 through July 2009, our equity research was distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the Global Analyst Research Settlement (GARS).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	The period covered by GARS ended in July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	Although the banks covered by GARS are no longer required to provide independent research to their clients, we entered into equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under GARS.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	We also sell equity research to several other companies that purchase our research for their own use or provide our research to their affiliated financial advisors or to individual investors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	In addition, we re continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions through a variety of other channels.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P156_S3	In 2010, we replaced approximately one-third of the lost annual GARS revenue with other equity research business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	In December 2009, we began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	We entered into our first credit research agreement with a major financial services firm to provide credit ratings and research to its 18,000 financial advisors beginning in the third quarter of 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P157_S2	The firm s internal credit research team also has access to Morningstar Select, our institutional credit research platform.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P157_S3	Although the revenue impact in 2010 was not significant, we believe this credit research agreement gives us an important foothold in this new area.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	We also offer a variety of financial communications and newsletters, other investment software, and investment indexes.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	This segment represented approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	Revenue from our Investment Information segment increased $58.3 million, or 15.1%, to $445.0 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	Acquisitions contributed $40.4 million of revenue in 2010 primarily from LIM, Realpoint, OBSR, and CPMS.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	Revenue from acquisitions represents approximately 10 percentage points of the revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P160_S3	Excluding acquisitions, higher revenue in our software, data, and investment research products and services more than offset the loss of $12.5 million of revenue from GARS, which expired at the end of July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P160_S4	Organic revenue for our software product lines was up approximately $18.2 million, driven by Morningstar.com, Morningstar Direct, and to a lesser extent from Advisor Workstation and Site Builder and Licensed Tools.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	In 2009, revenue for our Investment Information segment declined $4.1 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	Acquisitions contributed $25.9 million to segment revenue in 2009, partially offsetting the $30.0 million revenue decline experienced across a number of our product lines, including the loss of $9.4 million of GARS revenue in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	Revenue from our investment research products was down $17.2 million, or 24.1%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S3	Approximately $9.4 million of the decrease resulted from the end of GARS and an additional $3.2 million of the decrease reflects lower revenue from investment newsletters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S4	Organic revenue for software product lines was down about $5.1 million, or 2.2%, driven by a $6.4 million decline in the U.S. version of Morningstar.com and a $0.3 million revenue decline in advisor software.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P161_S5	These declines were partly offset by a $2.4 million revenue increase for institutional software and data-related products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	Revenue for Morningstar.com, which includes Internet advertising sales and Premium Membership subscriptions, was the primary driver of the segment revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	In 2010, positive trends in Internet advertising sales were partially offset by continued decline in Premium Membership revenue in the United States.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	Internet advertising increased 76.2% in 2010, after declining 36.9% in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S2	Subscriptions for the U.S. version of the Morningstar.com Premium service declined to 138,732 as of December 31, 2010 compared with 150,473 as of December 31, 2009, and 177,518 as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S3	The shortfall in revenue was due to a weak trial pipeline but we believe our retention efforts stemmed the rate of decline in subscriptions in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S4	In addition, we moderately increased subscription prices for U.S. Premium Membership in both January 2010 and 2009, which partly offset the revenue decline associated with lower subscription levels.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S5	Morningstar Direct made positive contributions to segment revenue in both 2010 and 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S6	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 4,773 worldwide as of December 31, 2010, compared with 3,524 as of December 31, 2009 and 2,961 as of December 31, 2008, with strong growth in the U.S. and internationally.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P163_S7	The growth in licenses reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients, as well as client migrations to Morningstar Direct from Institutional Workstation.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	Advisor software revenue represented approximately 25.9% of the increase in segment revenue in 2010 as higher revenue from Advisor Workstation and Site Builder and Licensed Tools offset the decline in Principia revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	In comparison, advisor software revenue was down in 2009 because lower Principia revenue more than offset the increase in Advisor Workstation and other products.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P164_S2	Principia revenue declined 6.6% in 2010 and 14.3% in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P164_S3	The decline partly reflects clients migrating from Principia to Advisor Workstation.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	The number of U.S. licenses for Morningstar Advisor Workstation increased slightly to 153,170 as of December 31, 2010 from 148,392 as of December 31, 2009 and 151,874 as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	Principia subscriptions totaled 32,681 as of December 31, 2010, down from 35,844 as of December 31, 2009 and 43,019 as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	Licensed Data made positive contributions to segment revenue in both 2010 and 2009, reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	The Licensed Data service gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	The data packages we offer include proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, and ownership.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	Investment research revenue declined in 2010 as well as in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	As mentioned above, the period covered by GARS expired at the end of July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	Our post-settlement equity research revenue in 2010 replaced approximately one-third of the annual GARS revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P169_S2	GARS revenue was $12.5 million in 2009, compared with $21.9 million in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	We entered into new equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under GARS.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P170_S1	In addition, we re continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions through a variety of other channels.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	Revenue from our other investment research products was essentially flat in 2010 after declining in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	In 2010, higher revenue from conferences and corporate credit ratings research helped offset the continuing decline in revenue from newsletters and books.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, we discontinued three of the print publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year: Morningstar Funds 500 , Morningstar Stocks 500 , and Morningstar ETFs 150 .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P172_S1	Lower advertising revenue from publications sold in Australia and lower revenue from the annual Morningstar Investment Conference held in the second quarter also contributed to the decline in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	In 2010, operating income for the Investment Information segment decreased $10.7 million, or 7.7%, as operating expense increased more than revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	Operating expense was up $69.0 million in 2010, with additional costs from acquisitions contributing approximately 45% of the increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	Higher salaries (reflecting expanded headcount) and incentive compensation (including bonus and sales commission expense) also contributed to the increase.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P174_S2	Bonus expense increased $10.9 million in 2010, including incremental bonus expense from recent acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P174_S3	An increase in employee benefits expense, including employee healthcare benefits and the partial reinstatement of matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	Operating margin for the Investment Information segment declined 7.1 percentage points in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P175_S1	Approximately 6.4 percentage points of the margin decline reflects higher compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	Acquisitions had a slightly negative impact on the margin.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	In 2009, operating income for the Investment Information segment was $138.4 million, a slight decrease compared with 2008, as the $4.1 million decline in revenue was partially offset by lower operating expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	Operating expense decreased $3.8 million in 2009 as cost reductions for bonuses, other compensation expense, and advertising and marketing were partially offset by additional operating expense from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P178_S1	Bonus expense declined $11.0 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P178_S2	Most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for 2009 as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P178_S3	The reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P178_S4	Other compensation-related expense was down, primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, reducing operating expense by $4.3 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	Sales and marketing costs decreased $8.3 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P179_S1	Most of the decline reflects lower spending on advertising and marketing (primarily direct mail expense) and lower travel costs, which we pared back because of the challenging business environment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P179_S2	As mentioned above, we discontinued three of the publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year, and therefore didn t incur costs to promote these publications in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	The Investment Management segment includes all of our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	The key products and services in this segment based on revenue are Investment Consulting, which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds, including mutual funds and variable annuities; Retirement Advice, including the Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson platforms; and Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons, risk levels, and investment strategies that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax-deferred accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P182_S1	The method of calculation varies by client; some contracts include provisions for calculating average assets based on daily data, while others use weekly or monthly data.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P182_S2	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our Investment Consulting business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P183_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P183_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P183_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	In our Retirement Advice business, our contracts may include fixed fees for advice and guidance, one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Consulting and Retirement Advice businesses because our fee structures are customized by client.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P185_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range would be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P185_S2	We disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our periodic filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s average daily account balance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P186_S1	Fees for our mutual fund and ETF portfolios generally range from 30 to 40 basis points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P186_S2	We charge 55 basis points for our customized stock portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	This segment represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	Investment Management segment revenue increased $18.0 million, or 19.5%, in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P188_S1	Acquisitions contributed $7.5 million of revenue in 2010, primarily from the Intech and OBSR acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P188_S2	Excluding acquisitions, revenue increased across all product categories in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	Retirement Advice was the main driver of the revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P189_S1	We primarily earn license-based fees for the advice and guidance services we provide through our Retirement Advice platform.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P189_S2	Revenue for these services increased in 2010 primarily from Advice by Ibbotson, after declining in 2009 because of several smaller client non-renewals.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P189_S3	Investment Consulting and Managed Portfolios also contributed to the revenue increase in 2010, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P189_S4	Higher revenue from Investment Consulting in 2010 was partially offset by a client non-renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	The revenue increase in 2010 represented a positive change from trends in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	In 2009, Investment Management revenue was down 17.4%, driven by two Investment Consulting non-renewals.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S2	In 2009, Investment Consulting, which was a leading contributor to revenue growth in previous years, accounted for about three-fourths of the segment s revenue decline.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S3	One client did not renew its contract when it expired in the fourth quarter of 2008 and another client did not renew its contract in May 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S4	Combined, these contracts represented about $17 million of revenue in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P190_S5	Acquisitions contributed $3.7 million to segment revenue in 2009, partially mitigating the revenue decline.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	We had approximately $67.7 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2010, an increase of approximately 21% compared with $56.0 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	In 2008, revenue from asset-based fees was $66.6 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P191_S2	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12% of consolidated revenue in both 2010 and 2009, down slightly from 13% in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P191_S3	Within the Investment Management segment, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 60% of segment revenue over the past three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	Total assets under advisement and management were $132.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, an increase from $82.6 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $78.8 billion as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P192_S1	About $39.0 billion of the total assets as of December 31, 2010 reflects a new fund-of-funds program that began in May 2010 for an existing Morningstar Associates client.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P192_S2	Previously, Morningstar created model portfolios for the same client, so the increase in assets represents incremental growth for an existing revenue stream.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P192_S3	Excluding assets from the new fund-of-funds program, total assets under advisement and management increased, mainly reflecting positive market performance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P192_S4	Total assets under advisement also include approximately $3.4 billion from the Intech acquisition in July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	The asset totals as of the end of each year don t fully reflect the change in average asset levels during the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P193_S1	The asset-based fees we earn are primarily based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P193_S2	Average assets under advisement and management (calculated based on available quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $102.3 billion in 2010, up about 35% from $78.6 billion in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P193_S3	In 2009, average asset levels declined from substantially higher levels in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P193_S4	Average assets under advisement and management were $103.9 billion in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	We provided Investment Consulting advisory services on approximately $107.2 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010, compared with approximately $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 and approximately $66.2 billion as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P194_S1	The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P194_S2	We also provide Investment Consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P196_S0	As mentioned above, assets under advisement as of December 31, 2010 includes approximately $39 billion related to a new fund-of-funds program that began in May 2010 for an existing Morningstar Associates client.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P196_S1	Excluding assets from the new fund-of-funds program, assets under advisement for Investment Consulting increased slightly over 2009, mainly reflecting positive market performance partially offset by a client non-renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P196_S2	Total assets under advisement for Investment Consulting as of December 31, 2009 declined approximately 7.3% compared with December 31, 2008, as assets under advisement from Morningstar Associates declined 27.4%, which was partially offset by assets under advisement from Ibbotson Associates, which increased about 9.0%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P196_S3	The majority of the asset decline in 2009 reflects the loss of one of the contracts discussed above, partially offset by positive market performance, and, to a lesser extent, from net inflows and new client wins in assets under advisement.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P197_S0	We cannot separately quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios because we do not have custody of the assets in the majority of our investment management business.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P197_S1	The information we receive from our clients does not separately identify the impact of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P197_S2	We also cannot precisely quantify the impact of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	Assets under management for Retirement Advice increased to $19.6 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $15.7 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P199_S0	We cannot separately quantify the factors affecting assets under management for our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P199_S1	These factors primarily consist of employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P199_S2	We cannot quantify the impact of these other factors because the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances due to market movement.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P200_S0	The tables below show the breakdown of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson, as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P201_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios also contributed to the segment s revenue increase in 2010, although to a lesser extent than Retirement Advice.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P201_S1	The higher revenue mainly reflects higher average asset levels during 2010 compared with 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P201_S2	Assets under management for Morningstar Managed Portfolios were $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 compared with $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2008, reflecting positive equity market returns and net inflows.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P202_S0	In 2010, operating income for the Investment Management segment increased $3.9 million, or 7.4%, as revenue increased more than operating expense.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P202_S1	In contrast, 2009 operating income declined $7.5 million, or 12.4%, as reductions in operating expense were not sufficient enough to outweigh the revenue decline.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S0	In 2010, operating expense in this segment rose $14.1 million, or 35.8%, after declining $11.9 million, or 23.2%, in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S1	Approximately 40% of the segment s operating expense increase reflects recent acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S2	Higher salaries and incentive compensation, including bonuses and sales commissions, contributed approximately two-thirds of the overall operating expense increase in this segment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S3	Bonus expense rose $4.2 million in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S4	Sales commissions and employee benefits, including employee healthcare benefits and matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, also increased, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S5	Operating expense in 2010 also includes $2.0 million related to a separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P203_S6	A slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our Advice by Ibbotson service partially offset these increases.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S0	In 2009, the operating expense decrease was primarily because of lower bonus and other compensation-related expense, partially offset by additional operating expense related to the Intech acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S1	Bonus expense declined $10.4 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S2	Most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for 2009 as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S3	The reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in 2009 compared with 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S4	Other compensation-related expense was down, primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, reducing operating expense by $1.3 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P204_S5	A slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our Advice by Ibbotson service also contributed to the decrease.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P205_S0	The segment s operating margin in the segment decreased 5.8 percentage points to 51.5% in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P205_S1	The margin decline mainly reflects higher bonus expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P205_S2	The $2.0 million separation payment reduced the margin by approximately 2.0 percentage points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P205_S3	Salaries and employee benefits also contributed to the margin decline, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P205_S4	In addition, acquisitions had a negative impact on the margin of approximately 1.6 percentage points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P206_S0	Operating margin was 57.3% in 2009, an increase of 3.3 percentage points over 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P206_S1	Lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue was the main driver of the margin improvement.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P206_S2	The decrease in other compensation-related expense also contributed to the margin improvement, although to a much lesser extent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P206_S3	These factors were offset by incremental costs from the Intech acquisition and higher compensation expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P207_S0	We do not allocate corporate costs to our business segments.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P207_S1	The corporate items category also includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded when we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P207_S2	The table below shows the components of corporate items that impacted our consolidated operating income:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S0	Amortization of intangible assets increased $5.9 million in 2010 and $2.4 million in 2009, mainly reflecting incremental amortization expense related to acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S1	We paid $281.9 million for acquisitions during the past three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, we had $169.0 million and $135.5 million of net intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S3	We amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives, ranging from one to 25 years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S4	Based on acquisitions completed through December 31, 2010, we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be approximately $25.7 million in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P208_S5	Some of the purchase price allocations are preliminary, and the values assigned to intangible assets and the associated amortization expense may change in future periods.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P209_S0	After increasing $3.5 million in 2009, depreciation expense for corporate departments did not change significantly in 2010 from 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P209_S1	We relocated to our new corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in higher depreciation expense in the subsequent years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P210_S0	In 2010, corporate unallocated expense decreased $8.9 million, as some expenses recorded in 2009 did not recur in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P210_S1	Corporate unallocated expense in 2009 includes $9.5 million of expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options and deposit penalties.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P210_S2	In 2010, expense related to liabilities for vacant office space declined $2.2 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P210_S3	In addition, in 2010 we capitalized approximately $0.8 million of operating expense for software development.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P210_S4	These factors, which favorably impact the year-over-year comparison, were partially offset by incremental expense from acquisitions, higher compensation and bonus expense, and higher professional fees.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P211_S0	Corporate unallocated increased $0.7 million in 2009 as certain expenses recorded in 2009 more than offset the expense reductions implemented in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P211_S1	The increases included the $6.1 million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options, as well as an operating expense for the deposit penalty of $3.4 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P211_S2	This category also includes a $3.2 million expense to increase lease vacancy reserves, primarily for the former Ibbotson headquarters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P212_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) and Morningstar Sweden AB.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P212_S1	In the first six months of 2010, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P212_S2	In 2009 and 2008, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Denmark and Morningstar Korea.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P212_S3	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities is primarily from our position in MJKK.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P213_S0	In 2010, we acquired an additional 75% ownership interest in Morningstar Denmark, increasing our ownership percentage to 100%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P213_S1	As a result, we no longer account for our investment in Morningstar Denmark using the equity method.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P214_S0	In July 2010, we began consolidating the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Morningstar Denmark in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P215_S0	In 2009, we acquired an additional 40% ownership interest in Morningstar Korea, increasing our ownership percentage to 80%.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P215_S1	As a result, we no longer account for our investment in Morningstar Korea using the equity method.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P216_S0	In September 2009, we began consolidating the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Morningstar Korea in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P217_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P218_S0	The following table presents the components of net non-operating income:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P219_S0	Interest income, net mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P219_S1	Net interest income decreased $0.6 million in 2010 and $2.7 million during 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P219_S2	The decrease in both years reflects lower returns on our invested balances during the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P220_S0	Other income, net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P220_S1	It also includes royalty income from MJKK and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P220_S2	In 2010, we recorded a holding gain of approximately $4.6 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P220_S3	This gain represents the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark at the date of acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P220_S4	In 2009, we recorded a holding gain of approximately $0.4 million when we increased our ownership in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P221_S0	The following table summarizes our effective tax rate:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P222_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P223_S0	In 2010, our effective tax rate was 33.1%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P223_S1	The lower tax rate in 2010 reflects the positive impact of certain income tax benefits, including the difference between U.S. federal and foreign tax rates, tax credits related to Morningstar s research and development activities, and the use of foreign net operating losses that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P223_S2	These items favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately 3.7 percentage points in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P224_S0	Income tax expense in 2010 includes approximately $1.7 million of non-cash expense related to the $4.6 million holding gain we recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P224_S1	This income tax expense did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P225_S0	In 2009, our effective tax rate decreased by 1.5 percentage points compared with 2008 despite several items that increased our effective tax rate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P225_S1	State income taxes represented 2.7 percentage points of our effective tax rate compared with 1.5 percentage points in 2008, due to a favorable impact from reducing accruals for state income taxes in 2008 that did not recur in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P226_S0	Second, in 2009, we recorded an operating expense of $3.4 million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P226_S1	This penalty is not deductible for income tax purposes and increased our effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P227_S0	The $6.1 million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of stock options originally considered incentive stock options increased the effective tax rate by 0.8 percentage points, as these operating expenses are subject to deduction limitations for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P228_S0	The above items, which increased our effective tax rate, were partially offset by three main factors.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P229_S0	First, research and development and foreign tax credits, some from previous years, reduced the 2009 effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P229_S1	A reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, primarily as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations, also reduced our effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P230_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $49.0 million related to our non-U.S. operations and have recorded a valuation allowance against all but $5.6 million of these NOLs.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P230_S1	Because of the historical operating losses for certain non-U.S. operations, a valuation allowance is required because we do not believe that we will be able to use all of our non-U.S. NOLs.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P231_S0	Certain positions we have taken or intend to take on our U.S. and non-U.S. tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P231_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $9.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $8.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $6.9 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P232_S0	It is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P233_S0	We anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the creation or reversal of valuation allowances for our non-U.S. operations as well as to changes in unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P234_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P235_S0	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P235_S1	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments, emphasizing principal preservation, and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high-quality stand-alone credit ratings.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P235_S2	Investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years; the weighted average maturity is approximately one year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P236_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P236_S1	To date we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P236_S2	Over the past three years, we invested $281.9 million for acquisitions, less cash acquired, with internally generated funds.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S0	We expect to make a recurring quarterly dividend payment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S1	We paid our first dividend in January 2011 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S2	This dividend was 5 cents per share for a total cash payment of $2.5 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S3	In September 2010, our board of directors also approved a share repurchase program that authorizes a repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S4	Through December 31, 2010, we paid $3.8 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P237_S5	From time to time we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P238_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $365.4 million, an increase of $22.9 million compared with December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P238_S1	This increase mainly reflects cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from employee stock-option exercises, partially offset by payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P239_S0	We used a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2011 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $38 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P239_S1	In 2011, we expect to pay approximately $4.2 million to two former executives as part of previously announced separation agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P240_S0	Our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P240_S1	We typically pay bonuses in the first quarter of the year.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P240_S2	As a result, cash flow from operations in the first quarter tends to be lower compared with subsequent quarters.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P241_S0	In 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $123.4 million, an increase of $22.2 million over 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P241_S1	The increase primarily reflects lower bonus payments in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P241_S2	We paid $21.4 million in annual bonus payments in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $58.9 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P241_S3	The bonuses paid in 2009 included approximately $48.9 million of bonus expense recorded in 2008 and approximately $10.0 million of bonus payments deferred from 2007.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P241_S4	In accordance with bonus program revisions adopted in January 2009, we no longer defer payment of a portion of the bonus from prior years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P242_S0	In addition, in 2010, we paid $4.9 million to one former and two current executives to adjust the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P243_S0	In 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $101.3 million, driven by $115.0 million of net income (adjusted for non-cash items) partially offset by $13.7 million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities, mainly driven by bonus payments.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P243_S1	We paid $58.9 million for bonuses in 2009, including $10.0 million in deferred payments from 2007.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P243_S2	The cash flow impact of these payments was partially offset by the cash flow benefit from accrued compensation for the 2009 bonuses.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P244_S0	In 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $149.3 million, driven by $112.2 million of net income (adjusted for non-cash items) and $37.1 million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P244_S1	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities benefited from a $18.9 million increase in deferred rent related to tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build-out of our new headquarters, a $46.9 million increase in accrued compensation, and a $41.9 million increase in income taxes payable.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P244_S2	Bonus payments of approximately $49.3 million and tax payments of $19.8 million offset these cash flow benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P245_S0	Cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments less proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments, and cash used for capital expenditures.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P245_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P246_S0	Cash used for investing activities was $87.9 million in 2010, $174.7 million in 2009, and $179.1 million in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P247_S0	Cash used for acquisitions in 2010, net of cash acquired, was $102.3 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P247_S1	We completed seven acquisitions in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P247_S2	The majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of Realpoint, OBSR, Morningstar Denmark, and the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corp.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P247_S3	In comparison, cash used for acquisitions, net of acquired cash, was $74.2 million in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P248_S0	We completed six acquisitions in 2009 and increased our investment in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P248_S1	The majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of LIM and our acquisition of the equity research and data business CPMS.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P248_S2	In 2008, cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $105.4 million, with the majority of this used for our acquisition of the Hemscott data, media, and investor relations website businesses and Tenfore Systems Limited.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P249_S0	In 2010, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by $28.6 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P249_S1	In contrast, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments, were $83.9 million and $24.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P249_S2	In 2010, we transferred funds from our investment portfolio to cash and cash equivalents to pay for acquisitions made in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P249_S3	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities, of $185.2 million and $212.1 million, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P249_S4	As of December 31, 2010, our investments represented approximately 51% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments, down 11 percentage points compared with December 31, 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S0	Capital expenditures were $14.8 million, $12.4 million, and $48.5 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S1	The 2010 capital expenditures include spending for our new office space in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S2	Capital expenditures peaked in 2008 when we paid for the build-out of our new headquarters in Chicago.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S3	Some of the cash outlay for this investment continued into 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S4	Capital expenditures in 2009 also include investment for a couple of our office locations in Europe.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S5	Tenant improvement allowances of $16.3 million, which are included in cash provided by operating activities, reduced the total amount of cash we paid for the headquarters build-out in 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S6	We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $14 million to $17 million in 2011, primarily for leasehold improvements at new and existing office locations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P250_S7	A portion of this includes remaining payments for our new development center in China.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P251_S0	Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P251_S1	These cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P252_S0	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P252_S1	Similarly, the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P252_S2	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P253_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock-option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P253_S1	As a result, we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P253_S2	Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P254_S0	In 2010, cash provided by financing activities was $12.5 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P254_S1	Proceeds from stock-option exercises totaled $9.2 million, while excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled $7.5 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P254_S2	Partially offsetting these inflows was $3.8 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P254_S3	In 2010, cash provided by financing activities decreased by $12.8 million, driven by a decrease in proceeds from stock-option exercises, a decline in excess tax benefits, and (to a lesser extent) cash used to repurchase common shares.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P255_S0	In 2009, cash provided by financing activities was $25.3 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P255_S1	Proceeds from stock-option exercises totaled $16.4 million and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled $8.7 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P255_S2	In 2009, cash provided by financing activities decreased by $25.4 million, or 50.1%, compared with 2008, driven mostly by a $17.9 million decline in excess tax benefits, and to a lesser extent by a $7.0 million decline in proceeds from stock-option exercises.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P255_S3	The decrease mainly reflects a lower average stock price at the time the stock options were exercised and a decrease in the number of options exercised.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P256_S0	Employees exercised approximately 0.8 million, 1.4 million, and 2.4 million stock options in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P256_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $31.4 million, $37.4 million, and $113.6 million, respectively.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P257_S0	We invested a total of $281.9 million, less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P257_S1	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P258_S0	See Note 18 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on events subsequent to December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P259_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P259_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 3 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P260_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P261_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P261_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P261_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P261_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P261_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P262_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P263_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P263_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P263_S2	We also provide analysis, consulting, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P263_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P264_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P265_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P266_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P266_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P267_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P267_S1	Probability of collection is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P267_S2	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S1	As of December 31, 2010, our deferred revenue was $146.3 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S3	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S4	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P268_S5	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P269_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired several companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P269_S1	Over the past three years, the total cash paid for acquisitions, less cash acquired, was $281.9 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P269_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we have recorded $317.7 million of goodwill arising from acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P270_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we allocated $251.7 million of gross value to intangible assets, primarily for customer-related assets, technology-based assets, and intellectual property.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P270_S1	The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to 25 years.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P271_S0	Management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P271_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P271_S2	Once it has been determined that recognition of an asset or liability in a business combination is appropriate, the asset or liability generally is measured at fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P272_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P273_S0	The determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P274_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P274_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames, technology-related intangibles including internally developed software and databases, and non-compete agreements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P275_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P275_S1	These valuation approaches include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P276_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P276_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P276_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P276_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P277_S0	Assess the appropriate method for recording amortization expense over the intangible asset s useful life: We use judgment to determine the rate at which the amortization expense should be recognized.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P277_S1	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P277_S2	If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method should be used.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P277_S3	Based on this guidance, we amortize intangible assets over their expected useful life using a straight-line amortization method.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P278_S0	We believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P279_S0	Goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 was $317.7 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P280_S0	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P280_S1	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P281_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P282_S0	Our reporting units are components of our reportable segments and constitute businesses for which discrete financial information, which is regularly reviewed by management, is available.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P282_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008 and did not record any impairment losses in these years, reflecting our assessment that our estimates of fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P283_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P284_S0	In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P284_S1	These estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P285_S0	Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long-term horizon.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P285_S1	We update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P286_S0	We believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P286_S1	If actual results differ from our estimates, future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P286_S2	This would result in a non-cash charge, adversely affecting our results of operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P287_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 includes $62.1 million of property, equipment, and capitalized software, net of accumulated depreciation, and $169.0 million of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P288_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35 , Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we review our property, equipment, capitalized software, and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P288_S1	Such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P289_S0	If the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P290_S0	Estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P290_S1	They are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P290_S2	Changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment, which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P291_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P291_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P292_S0	Under FASB ASC 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation , stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P293_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P293_S1	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P293_S2	We ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P293_S3	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P293_S4	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P294_S0	Because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year, we adjust the stock-based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P294_S1	In addition, we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P294_S2	In 2010 and 2009, we recorded approximately $0.2 million of additional stock-based compensation expense related to these changes in estimates.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P295_S0	We believe that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P296_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P296_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P297_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P297_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_11_ITEM7_P297_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P297_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P297_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P298_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P298_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P298_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had gross deferred tax assets of $37.6 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $43.3 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P298_S3	The deferred tax assets include $13.0 million of deferred tax assets related to $49.0 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P298_S4	Because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non-U.S. operations that generated these NOLs, we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.6 million of the NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P299_S0	assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P300_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P300_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P300_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P300_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S0	We assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 , Income Taxes.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S1	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S2	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S3	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P301_S5	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P302_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P302_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P303_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P303_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P303_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P304_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P304_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P305_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations, which we describe in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P305_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P305_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P305_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be impacted.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P306_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P306_S1	ASU 2009-13 supersedes EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P306_S2	ASU 2009-13 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue-generating activities, addresses how to separate deliverables, and specifies how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P307_S0	Vendors often provide multiple products or services to customers.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P307_S1	Because products and services are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same contractual arrangement, this guidance enables vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P308_S0	For Morningstar, ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on January 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P308_S1	Also in October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14 , Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P308_S2	This update affects vendors that sell or lease tangible products in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole.

1289419_11_ITEM7_P311_S1	ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P311_S2	For these reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P311_S3	In making this determination, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P311_S4	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P312_S0	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2010-28 is effective on January 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P313_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P313_S1	ASU No. 2010-29 specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P313_S2	ASU No. 2010-29 also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P313_S3	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P314_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_11_ITEM7_P315_S0	The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P316_S0	Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits) recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_11_ITEM7_P316_S1	The amount included in the table represents amounts for which the statues of limitations are expected to lapse during 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM7_P316_S2	The table excludes $8.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our investment portfolio is mainly invested in high-quality fixed-income securities.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not have any direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $365.4 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $0.8 million.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P9_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	In 2010, we determined that the cumulative effect of adjustments related to prior periods were material, in aggregate, if recorded in our 2010 financial statements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	These amounts related primarily to our accounting for deferred taxes and, to a lesser extent, to expense adjustments associated with vacant office space and rent for one of our office leases.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	We evaluated the effects of these errors on our prior periods Consolidated Financial Statements, individually and in the aggregate, in accordance with the materiality guidance provided by the SEC staff, as included in SAB Topics 1M and 1N, and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P17_S3	However, in accordance with the provisions of these SAB Topics, we are restating our Consolidated Financial Statements, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The acronyms that appear in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements refer to the following:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	We conduct our business operations through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest have been consolidated.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributed to Morningstar, Inc. s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
1289419_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of fixed-income securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs as described below:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	We provide additional information about our investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 6 in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments , permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	FASB ASC 825 allows the fair value option to be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis when the asset or liability is initially recognized or when there s an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P37_S3	We do not apply this fair value option to any of our eligible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, no single customer represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	For acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009, we follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their full fair values as of the date control is obtained, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations on the acquisition date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P44_S3	Prior to January 1, 2009, we generally included acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs as part of the cost of the acquired business.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and values applicable for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Our reporting units are components of our reportable segments.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2010, 2009, and 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	We did not record any impairment losses in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	We did not record any impairment losses in 2010, 2009, or 2008.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	We earn revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	We sell many of our offerings, such as our newsletters, Principia software, and Premium service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S4	Several of our other products are sold through license agreements, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Equity Research, Morningstar Direct, Retirement Advice, and Licensed Data.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P49_S5	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	For some of our other institutional services, mainly Investment Consulting, we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and earn fees as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	We also earn fees relating to Morningstar Managed Portfolios as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	A portion of the fees for managed retirement accounts offered through Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson are earned as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided, which we expect to recognize to revenue in future periods.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which services have not yet been provided.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	We follow the standards established in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , including subtopic 25, Multiple-Element Arrangements , and FASB ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	We recognize revenue from subscription sales in equal installments over the term of the subscription.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	We recognize revenue from Investment Consulting, Retirement Advice, Internet advertising, and other non-subscription products and services when the product or service is delivered or, when applicable, over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the contract.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	Revenue from Internet advertising is generated primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time their ads are displayed on our site.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P54_S4	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we assign the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite for recognition of revenue.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we generally begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, such taxes are excluded from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense is mainly related to grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units and restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar s common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, in general, Morningstar s full-time employees are eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P60_S3	We record a liability for employees sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements, and also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding primarily reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	Beginning in 2010, we compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	In May 2010, we issued restricted stock in conjunction with the acquisition of Realpoint, LLC.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	Because the restricted stock contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends, it meets the criteria of a participating security.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
1289419_11_ITEM8_P69_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	These products are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Morningstar Direct is a web-based institutional research platform.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Site Builder and Licensed Tools are services that help institutional clients build customized websites or enhance their existing sites with Morningstar s online tools and components.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Principia is our CD-ROM-based investment research and planning software for advisors.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Investment Information segment also includes Morningstar Equity Research, which we distribute through several channels.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	From June 2004 through July 2009, our equity research was distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the Global Analyst Research Settlement.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	The period covered by the Global Analyst Research Settlement expired at the end of July 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	The banks covered by it are no longer required to provide independent research to their clients.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P78_S3	We also sell Equity Research to other companies that purchase our research for their own use or provide our research to their affiliated advisors or individual investor clients.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Investment Management segment includes all of our asset management operations, which earn the majority of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The key products and services in this segment based on revenue are Investment Consulting, which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds, including mutual funds and variable annuities; Retirement Advice, including the Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson platforms; and Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons, risk levels, and investment strategies that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax-deferred accounts.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	Our segment accounting policies are the same as those described in Note 3, except for the capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	We exclude these items from our operating segment results to provide our chief operating decision maker with a better indication of each segment s ability to generate cash flow.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	This information is one of the criteria used by our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources to each segment.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	We include capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions in the Corporate Items category Our segment disclosures are consistent with the business segment information provided to our chief operating decision maker on a recurring basis; for that reason, we don t present balance sheet information by segment.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P81_S4	We disclose goodwill by segment in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 350-20-50, Intangibles - Goodwill - Disclosure.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following tables present information about our operating segments:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	We classify our investments in three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	We monitor the concentration, diversification, maturity, and liquidity of our investment portfolio, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities, and classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Held-to-maturity investments include a $1,600,000 certificate of deposit held as collateral against two bank guarantees for our office lease in Australia.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	The fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements and the necessary disclosures are as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	We did not transfer any investments between levels of the fair value hierarchy in 2010 or 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting these investment categories each in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	We completed several acquisitions over the past three years, which we describe below:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Aegis Equities Research, a leading provider of independent equity research in Australia, for $10,717,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 1, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	The preliminary allocation includes $5,801,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Goodwill of $5,534,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefits of creating a larger analyst team that will enable us to expand our coverage of Australian-listed companies, provide Australian clients with more robust independent research, and give us the potential to expand our services in multiple delivery channels.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	We are in the process of determining what portion of the value assigned to intangible assets, if any, is deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR) for $16,754,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	OBSR is a premier provider of fund research, ratings, and investment consulting services in the United Kingdom and offers an array of customized consulting services including model portfolios, advice on fund construction, and corporate governance services that are used by many of the leading financial advisers and fund platforms.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 12, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	The allocation includes $9,266,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	Goodwill of $12,422,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefit of adding to our existing fund research team in London and continuing to build our thought leadership in investment research.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P102_S2	OBSR will also help us expand our investment consulting presence in the United Kingdom, where we already provide asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction services to institutions and intermediaries.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	The deferred tax liability of $2,317,000 is primarily because the amortization expense related to intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	In May 2010, we acquired Realpoint, LLC (Realpoint), a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	Realpoint offers securities ratings, research, surveillance services, and data to help institutional investors identify credit risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	Institutional investment firms subscribe to Realpoint s ratings and analytics, including money managers who invest in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P104_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 3, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	In conjunction with this acquisition, we paid $38,327,000 in cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements and in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations , we account for these grants as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	See Note 11 for additional information concerning the accounting for this restricted stock.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	The allocation includes $20,920,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	Goodwill of $23,103,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity for Morningstar to enter the structured finance ratings and analysis business.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	The value assigned to goodwill, intangible assets, and restricted stock at the date of grant are deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	In July 2010, we acquired an additional 75% interest in Morningstar Danmark A/S (Morningstar Denmark), increasing our ownership to 100% from 25%.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	Morningstar Denmark s main offering is the investment information website for individual investors, Morningstar.dk, which provides fund and ETF data, portfolio tools, and market analysis.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P111_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on July 1, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	Morningstar Denmark s total estimated fair value of $20,192,000 includes $15,467,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 75% interest in Morningstar Denmark and $4,725,000 related to the 25% of Morningstar Denmark we previously held.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 25% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest and recorded a non-cash holding gain of $4,564,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P112_S2	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	The purchase price allocation includes $9,854,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $2,504,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Goodwill of $12,342,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer Morningstar s full suite of products and services to investors in Denmark and further leveraging Morningstar s global reach, investment databases, and technology expertise.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	In November 2010, we acquired the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation (ASMC) for $14,113,000 in cash.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	The acquisition includes the Annuity Intelligence Report (AI Report), a web-based service that helps broker-dealers, insurers, and the financial professionals they support better understand and more effectively present variable annuity products to their clients.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	The AI Report service leverages a proprietary database of more than 1,000 variable annuities that includes plain-English translations of complex but important information found in prospectuses and other public filings.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P116_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on November 1, 2010.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	The preliminary allocation includes $6,407,000 of acquired intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	These assets primarily include customer-related assets and technology-based assets, including software and a database that are amortized over a weighted average estimated life of 10 years.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	The preliminary goodwill value of $8,921,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P119_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to combine Morningstar s strength in variable annuity subaccount data and modeling tools with AI Report s product-level data and proprietary methodologies.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	The value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets are deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	We also completed two other acquisitions in 2010:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	Footnoted business of Financial Fineprint Inc.:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	In February 2010, we acquired the Footnoted business of Financial Fineprint Inc. (Footnoted), a blog for professional money managers, analysts, and individual investors.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	In July 2010, we acquired Seeds Group (Seeds), a leading provider of investment consulting services and fund research in France.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	Through its subsidiary Seeds Finance, Seeds provides investment consulting services and specializes in asset liability management, manager selection, plan construction, risk, and portfolio management in alternative investments and active strategies.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P124_S2	Its subsidiary, Multiratings.com, provides a fund research and investment education website for advisor groups and institutions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P124_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on July 1, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	The combined purchase price for these two acquisitions was $6,162,000, less acquired cash.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	For these two acquisitions, the following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of acquisition:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	The purchase price allocation includes $2,580,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	Approximately $260,000 of the intangible assets is deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	The recorded goodwill amount of $3,972,000 for Footnoted and Seeds represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	For Footnoted, we paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefits of offering Footnoted s unique research with Morningstar s investor-centric content on Morningstar.com.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following table shows our property, equipment, and capitalized software summarized by major category:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	The following table summarizes our depreciation expense:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	The following table shows our minimum future rental commitments due in each of the next five years and thereafter for all non-cancelable operating leases, consisting primarily of leases for office space:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	The following table summarizes our rent expense including taxes, insurance, and other operating costs:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Deferred rent includes build-out and rent abatement allowances received, which are amortized over the remaining portion of the original term of the lease as a reduction in office lease expense.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	We include deferred rent, as appropriate, in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	In 2010 and 2009, we recorded changes to our liability for vacant office space, primarily for the former Ibbotson headquarters.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	We increased the liability related to this vacant office space because we anticipated receiving lower sublease income and expected it would take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P211_S2	In addition, we increased our liability for vacant office space related to the equity research and data business acquired from CPMS.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	We include our liability for vacant office space, as appropriate, in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	The following table shows the change in our liability for vacant office space from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2010:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	In November 2004, we adopted the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance shares.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P213_S2	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P213_S3	Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, does not participate in the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or prior plans.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	Since the adoption of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, we have granted stock options and, beginning in 2006, restricted stock units.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	Prior to November 2004, we granted stock options under various plans, including the 1993 Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Morningstar Stock Option Plan, and the 2001 Morningstar Stock Option Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans).
1289419_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan amends and restates the Prior Plans.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	Under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, we will not grant any additional options under any of the Prior Plans, and any shares subject to an award under any of the Prior Plans that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options or in payment of any required income tax withholding, will not be available for awards under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	The following table summarizes the number of shares available for future grants under our 2004 Stock Incentive Plan:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit we recorded in the past three years:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P218_S1	Because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter, we adjust the stock-based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	Restricted stock units granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan generally vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P220_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P220_S2	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during past three years:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units was approximately $27,425,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	We expect to recognize this expense over an average period of approximately 33 months.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	In conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition in May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee shareholders.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P222_S1	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P222_S2	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements, in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , we account for these grants as stock-based compensation expense, and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P222_S3	See Note 7 for additional information concerning the Realpoint acquisition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	We measured the fair value of the restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P223_S1	We amortize this value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P223_S2	We have assumed that all of the restricted stock will ultimately vest, and therefore we have not incorporated a forfeiture rate for purposes of determining the stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock was approximately $8,115,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P224_S1	We expect to recognize this expense over 52 months, from January 2011 through April 2015.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	We have not made any stock option grants since January 2006.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	All options granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plans were vested as of January 1, 2010 and there was no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P225_S2	Because the options expire 10 years after the date of grant, some options granted under these plans remain outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	Almost all of the options granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan have a premium feature in which the exercise price increases over the term of the option at a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield as of the date of grant.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity for our various stock option grants.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P227_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	All outstanding options were vested and exercisable as of January 1, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as December 31, 2010:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the tables above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $53.08 on that date.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P231_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return which exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P231_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P232_S0	In 2009, we determined that certain incentive stock options (ISOs) granted to one former and two current executives, including Tao Huang, our chief operating officer, should have been treated as non-qualified stock options for the executives and our income tax purposes.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P232_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an operating expense of $4,887,000 related to adjusting the tax treatment of these stock options that were originally considered ISOs.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P232_S2	In the first quarter of 2010, we paid these individuals $4,887,000 to compensate for the difference in tax treatment.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P233_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P233_S1	In 2010, we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of an employee s contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee s compensation in the pay period.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P233_S2	The match paid in 2010 represents approximately half of the benefit in 2008, after having suspended the matching contributions in 2009.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P234_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P235_S0	The following table presents the components of our net non-operating income:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P236_S0	Interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P237_S0	Other income (expense), net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to non-U.S. operations.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P237_S1	It also includes realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P237_S2	In 2010, this category also includes the holding gain of $4,564,000 resulting from the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark; in 2009, it includes the holding gain of $352,000 resulting from the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P237_S3	See Notes 7 and 8 for additional information concerning Morningstar Denmark and Morningstar Korea.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P238_S0	The larger expense in 2008 was influenced primarily by foreign currency exchange losses in the fourth quarter driven by a significantly stronger U.S. dollar.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P239_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P240_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P241_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P242_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P243_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P243_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P244_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P245_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. NOL carryforwards:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P246_S0	Our U.S. NOL carryforward at December 31, 2010 of $2,811,000 is subject to limitations on the use of the NOL imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and therefore is limited to approximately $225,000 per year.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P248_S0	The decrease in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 compared with the prior year primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards in our non-U.S. operations as well as the impact of currency translations.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P249_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $39,400,000 as of December 31, 2010, because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P249_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P250_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P250_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P250_S2	In 2010, the statute of limitations lapsed on our 2006 U.S. federal tax returns.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P251_S0	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2007 to the present.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P251_S1	In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally extends to years prior to 2004.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P252_S0	We are currently under audit by various state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P252_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P253_S0	It is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P254_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $654,000 and a non-current liability of $8,173,000 for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P254_S1	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P255_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P256_S0	In 2010, we recorded a net increase of $3,020,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $3,701,000 increased our income tax expense by $2,548,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P256_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $681,000 for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $469,000 decreased our income tax expense by $374,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P257_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had $9,089,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $8,482,000, if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $6,895,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P258_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P258_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_11_ITEM8_P259_S0	We recorded the increase in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P260_S0	In November 2010, InvestPic, LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Morningstar, Inc. and several other companies alleging that each defendant infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,349,291, which relates to methods for performing statistical analysis on investment data and displaying the analyzed data in graphical form.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P260_S1	InvestPic seeks, among other things, unspecified damages because of defendants alleged infringing activities and costs.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P260_S2	Morningstar is evaluating the lawsuit but cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P261_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Realpoint for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P261_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P261_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones s request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar s corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P261_S3	Realpoint and Morningstar continue to vigorously contest liability on all of Egan-Jones claims for damages.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P262_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P263_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson s prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P263_S1	Business Logic is alleging that Ibbotson Associates and Morningstar violated Business Logic s rights by using its trade secrets to develop a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P263_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P263_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P264_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson Associates are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P265_S0	In December 2004, Morningstar Associates, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc., received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General s office seeking information and documents related to an investigation the New York Attorney General s office is conducting.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P265_S1	The subpoena asks for documents relating to the investment consulting services the company offers to retirement plan providers, including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P265_S2	Morningstar Associates has provided the requested information and documents.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P266_S0	In 2005, Morningstar Associates received subpoenas seeking information and documents related to investigations being conducted by the SEC and United States Department of Labor.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P266_S1	The subpoenas were similar in scope to the New York Attorney General subpoena.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P267_S0	In January 2007 and September 2009, respectively, the SEC and Department of Labor each notified Morningstar Associates that it had ended its investigation, with no enforcement action, fines, or penalties.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P268_S0	In January 2007, Morningstar Associates received a Notice of Proposed Litigation from the New York Attorney General s office.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P268_S1	The Notice centers on disclosure relating to an optional service offered to retirement plan sponsors (employers) that select 401(k) plan services from ING, one of Morningstar Associates clients.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P268_S2	The Notice gave Morningstar Associates the opportunity to explain why the New York Attorney General s office should not institute proceedings.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P268_S3	Morningstar Associates promptly submitted its explanation and has cooperated fully with the New York Attorney General s office.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P269_S0	We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of this matter, which may include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P269_S1	We also cannot predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P270_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P270_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P271_S0	In September 2010, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P271_S1	The first quarterly dividend was payable on January 14, 2011 to shareholders of record and to holders of restricted stock units on December 31, 2010.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P271_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we recorded a liability for dividends payable of $2,494,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P272_S0	In addition, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $100 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P272_S1	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P272_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had repurchased 76,218 shares for $3,785,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P273_S0	In January 2011, we announced that Tao Huang, chief operating officer, was leaving Morningstar.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P273_S1	At that time, we entered into a separation agreement that provides for payments of $3,764,000.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P273_S2	The majority of these separation payments will be expensed in the first quarter of 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P274_S0	In February 2011, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P274_S1	The dividend is payable April 29, 2011 to shareholders of record as of April 15, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P275_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P275_S1	ASU 2009-13 supersedes EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P275_S2	ASU 2009-13 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue-generating activities, addresses how to separate deliverables, and specifies how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P276_S0	Vendors often provide multiple products or services to customers.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P276_S1	Because products and services are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same contractual arrangement, this guidance enables vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P277_S0	For Morningstar, ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on January 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P277_S1	Also in October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14 , Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P277_S2	This update affects vendors that sell or lease tangible products in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P277_S3	ASU No. 2009-14 does not affect software revenue arrangements that do not include tangible products and also does not affect software revenue arrangements that include services if the software is essential to the functionality of those services.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P277_S4	We adopted ASU No. 2009-14 effective January 1, 2011 and do not anticipate any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P278_S0	Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_11_ITEM8_P279_S0	ASU No. 2010-06 requires entities to disclose information in the Level 3 rollforward about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis.

1289419_11_ITEM8_P280_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P280_S1	ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P280_S2	For these reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P280_S3	In making this determination, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P280_S4	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P281_S0	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2010-28 is effective on January 1, 2011.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P282_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P282_S1	ASU No. 2010-29 specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P282_S2	ASU No. 2010-29 also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1289419_11_ITEM8_P282_S3	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2011.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We maintain a series of comprehensive databases on many types of investments, focusing on investment vehicles that are widely used by investors globally.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	After building these databases, we add value and insight to the data by applying our core skills of research, technology, and design.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we provided extensive data on approximately 375,000 investments, including:
1289419_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Real-time price quotes for global foreign currencies.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business model is based on leveraging our investments in these databases by selling a wide variety of products and services to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions around the world.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our data and proprietary analytical tools such as the Morningstar Rating for mutual funds, which rates past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, and the Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund's underlying investment style, have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We've created other tools, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Market Barometer, which allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	We developed a popular Portfolio X-Ray tool that helps investors reduce risk and understand the key characteristics of their portfolios based on nine different factors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We offer a variety of qualitative measures such as Stewardship Grades, which help investors identify companies and funds that have demonstrated a high level of commitment to shareholders and stewardship of investors' capital.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2011, we introduced our forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Rating for funds, a global, qualitative measure based on our analyst research.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Since 1998, we've expanded our research efforts on individual stocks and have worked to popularize the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett; and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	We've also developed in-depth advice on security selection and portfolio building to meet the needs of investors looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe many investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	In keeping with our mission, we are pursuing five key growth strategies, which we describe below.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We review our growth strategies on a regular basis and refine them to reflect changes in our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	1. Enhance our position in each of our key market segments by focusing on our three major web-based platforms.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients increasingly want integrated solutions as opposed to using different research tools for different parts of their portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	To help meet this need, our strategy is to focus our product offerings on our three major platforms:
1289419_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	These products all include integrated research and portfolio tools, allowing investors to use our proprietary information and analysis across multiple security types.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	With each platform, we believe we can continue expanding our reach with our current audience, as well as extending to reach new market segments.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	With Morningstar.com, we're continuing to expand the range of content and market updates on the site, including third-party content.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We've also been focusing on mobile development, as well as expanding data and functionality to increase the site's value to both registered users and Premium members.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	With Advisor Workstation, we plan to build on our large installed base by expanding our mid- and back-office capabilities, improving the product's interface and design, and integrating real-time data and other functionality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	With Morningstar Direct, we're pursuing an aggressive development program to provide data and analysis on securities and investments around the world.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	We're adding third-party data and content and enhancing our technology to allow the product to function as a purely web-based solution.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P14_S5	We also plan to expand into new global markets, enhance our capabilities in portfolio management and accounting, and significantly increase the amount of equity research content and functionality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	2. Create a premier global investment database.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our goal is to continue building or acquiring new databases for additional types of investments, including various types of funds outside the United States and other widely used investment products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	As detailed on page 4, we currently provide extensive data on approximately 375,000 investments globally, including managed investment products, individual securities, capital markets data, real-time stock quotes from nearly all of the world's major stock exchanges, and a live data feed that covers exchange-traded equities, derivatives, commodities, futures, foreign exchanges, precious metals, news, company fundamentals, and analytics.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our data is the foundation for all of the products and services we offer.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We focus on proprietary, value-added data, such as our comprehensive data on current and historical portfolio holdings for mutual funds and variable annuities.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	Within each database, we continuously update our data to maintain timeliness and expand the depth and breadth of coverage.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our strategy is to continuously expand our databases, focusing on investment products that are widely used by large numbers of investors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	In particular, we're focusing on expanding our fundamental equity data.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P18_S5	We also strive to establish our databases as the pre-eminent choice for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients around the world, as well as continuing to invest in world-class data quality, processing, and delivery.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Over the past 10 years, we've developed a series of proprietary indexes based on our investment data.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Morningstar Indexes are rooted in our proprietary research and can be used for precise asset allocation and benchmarking and as tools for portfolio construction and market analysis.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We've expanded the range of indexes we offer and are working to expand our index business globally.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Continue building thought leadership in independent investment research.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our goal is to continue producing investment insights that empower investors and focus our research efforts in three major areas:
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Extend leadership position in global fund research.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Over the past several years, we have expanded our analyst coverage in fund markets outside of the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	We've built an integrated team of locally based fund experts to expand our research coverage in additional markets around the world.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , we had approximately 95 fund analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S4	We currently produce qualitative analyst research on more than 3,500 funds around the world.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S5	As part of these research efforts, we currently provide Morningstar Analyst Ratings for approximately 500 funds globally.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P22_S6	We plan to continue expanding the number of funds that have Morningstar Analyst Ratings and in-depth qualitative research reports.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Continue leveraging our capabilities in stocks.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our equity research complements our approach to mutual fund analysis, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund's portfolio.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we provided analyst research on approximately 2,100 companies globally.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	We're committed to maintaining the broad, high-quality coverage we've become known for as one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	We're working to expand distribution of our equity research through a variety of channels, including financial advisors, institutional investment firms, and companies outside of the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	We believe that investors' increasing awareness of the value of independent research will strengthen our business over the long term.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	We've also expanded our proprietary stock database, which we view as an important complement to our analyst research.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Build business in credit research and ratings.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	We began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers in December 2009 and currently produce research and ratings on more than 600 corporate credit issuers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	We view credit ratings as a natural extension of the equity research we've been producing for the past decade.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	We believe we have a unique viewpoint to offer on company default risk that leverages our cash-flow modeling expertise, proprietary measures like economic moat, and in-depth knowledge of the companies and industries we cover.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	We're including this research on our three major software platforms to provide investors with an additional perspective on fixed-income investments.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We also plan to monetize the ratings through enterprise licenses and subscriptions to our institutional equity research clients, who have access to the forecasts, models, and scores underlying the ratings.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also expanded our fixed-income capabilities with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings that specializes in research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe investors are looking for better research on these securities and that we're well-positioned to meet this need.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	4. Become a global leader in fund-of-funds investment management.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The large number of managed investment products available has made assembling them into well-constructed portfolios a difficult task for many investors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Consequently, fund-of-funds offerings have seen strong growth within the mutual fund, variable annuity, and hedge fund industries.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Cerulli Associates estimates that global multimanager assets--including publicly offered funds that invest in other funds as well as investment vehicles managed by multiple subadvisors--totaled approximately $1.7 trillion as of July 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe assembling and evaluating funds of funds is a natural extension of our expertise in understanding managed investment products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our fund-of-funds programs combine managed investment vehicles--typically mutual funds--in portfolios designed to help investors meet their financial goals.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	When we create portfolios made up of other funds, our goal is to simplify the investment process and help investors access portfolios that match their level of risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term investment objectives.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	We draw on our extensive experience analyzing funds and combine quantitative research with a qualitative assessment of manager skill and investment style.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We had a total of $140.4 billion in assets under advisement in our Investment Consulting business as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our advisory business focuses on relationships and agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager or asset allocation program designer for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis-point fee.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	We plan to continue building this business by expanding to reach new markets outside of the United States, expanding our capabilities in areas such as alternative investment strategies, developing more ways to incorporate risk protection and insurance, expanding to reach additional client segments, and focusing on performance and client support.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We also offer managed retirement account services through our Retirement Solutions platform, and had $19.9 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We offer these services for retirement plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to our managed account programs, which are quantitative systems that select investment options and make retirement planning choices for the participants.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We believe retirement plan participants will continue to adopt managed accounts because of the complexity involved in retirement planning.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios is a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , we had $3.0 billion in assets under management invested with Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Expand our international brand presence, products, and services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $184.9 million in revenue in 2011 compared with $157.1 million in 2010 and represent an increasing percentage of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our strategy is to expand our non-U.S. operations (either organically or through acquisitions) to meet the increasing demand for wide-ranging, independent investment insight by investors around the globe.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	Because more than half of the world's investable assets are located outside of the United States, we believe there are significant opportunities for us.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	We're focusing our non-U.S. sales efforts on our major products, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation and Morningstar Direct, as well as opportunities such as real-time data, qualitative investment research and ratings, investment indexes, and investment management services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	We also plan to explore new regions, such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East; continue expanding our databases to be locally and globally comprehensive; introduce new products in markets where we already have operations; and expand our sales and product support infrastructure around the world.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Throughout our 28-year history, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	From 2006 through 2010, we also completed 24 acquisitions to support our five key growth strategies (as detailed above).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	While we may make additional acquisitions to support these strategies, our primary focus now is on integrating previous acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	We did not make any acquisitions in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	For information about the acquisitions we made in 2009 and 2010, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	We operate our business in two segments:

1289419_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Investment Management, which includes all of our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	For information on segment operating income (loss) refer to Note 4 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Licensed Data, a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases, including real-time pricing data, and available through electronic data feeds; Morningstar Advisor Workstation, a web-based investment planning system for independent financial advisors as well as advisors affiliated with larger firms; Morningstar.com, which includes both Premium Memberships and Internet advertising sales; Morningstar Direct, a web-based institutional research platform; and Integrated Web Tools (formerly Site Builder and Licensed Tools), services that help institutional clients build customized websites or enhance their existing sites with Morningstar's online tools and components.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Most of our products for individual investors are designed for investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing and investors who seek out third-party sources to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial planners.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	We sell our advisor-related products both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing enterprise to use our products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our institutional clients include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan sponsors and providers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	We also have data reselling agreements with third-party providers of investment tools and applications, allowing us to increase the distribution of our data with minimal additional cost.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	We believe the Investment Information segment has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	We've historically had higher revenue in the second quarter because we hold our largest annual investment conference during the quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Other products in this segment generally have not shown marked seasonality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our largest customer in the Investment Information segment made up approximately 2% of segment revenue in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Licensed Data gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P152_S0	To enable these companies to do business in their designated territories, we provide them with the rights to the Morningstar name and logo and with access to certain of our products and technology.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P152_S1	Each company is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its country and working with Morningstar's data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases, develop new products, and enhance existing products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P153_S0	See Item 1A-Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our business operations outside of the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P154_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P154_S1	We try to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P154_S2	For example, in the normal course of business, we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P154_S3	We use these agreements to define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P155_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we maintain operating companies.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P155_S1	As we move into new countries, we consider adding to these registrations.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P155_S2	In some jurisdictions, we also register certain product identifiers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P155_S3	We have registered our name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in several other countries.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P156_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are registered marks of Morningstar in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P157_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States and Canada.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P157_S1	We believe these patents represent our commitment to developing innovative products and tools for investors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P158_S0	In the majority of our licensing agreements, we license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P158_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P159_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with all of our operating companies.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P159_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to develop and market similar products under our name in their operating territories.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P160_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and obtaining it directly from public filings.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P161_S0	We believe our business has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P161_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as the Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook and our largest annual investment conference, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P161_S2	Most of our products are sold with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P161_S3	This tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P162_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P162_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P163_S0	In 2011 , our largest customer accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P163_S1	On February 17, 2012, we received notification from this client that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P163_S2	We received about $12.4 million in Investment Consulting revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 2.0% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P164_S0	The economic and financial information industry has been marked by increased consolidation over the past several years, with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P164_S1	Some of our major competitors include Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; Thomson Reuters; and Yahoo!.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P164_S2	These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P164_S3	We also have a number of smaller competitors in our two business segments, which we discuss in Business Segments, Products, and Services above.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P165_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment analysis and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P166_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P166_S1	We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P166_S2	We have a flexible technology platform that allows our products to work together across a full range of investment databases, delivery formats, and market segments.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P166_S3	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P166_S4	This allows us to control our development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P167_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , our technology team consisted of approximately 900 programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P168_S0	In 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 our development expense represented 8.4% , 8.9% , and 8.0% , respectively, of our revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P168_S1	We expect that development expense will continue to represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue in the future.

1289419_12_ITEM1_P202_S2	He joined us in 1993 and has been instrumental in establishing design as one of our recognized core capabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P202_S3	He holds a bachelor's degree in industrial design from The Ohio State University and a master's degree in fine arts from the Yale University School of Art.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P203_S0	We were incorporated in Illinois on May 16, 1984.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P203_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P204_S0	We maintain a website at http://corporate.morningstar.com .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P204_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P204_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P204_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P204_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P205_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P205_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P205_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P206_S0	Our investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P207_S0	Three of our subsidiaries, Ibbotson Associates, Inc., Morningstar Associates, LLC, and Morningstar Investment Services, Inc. are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P207_S1	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P207_S2	Such requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P208_S0	As registered investment advisors, all three subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P209_S0	In addition, because these three subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P209_S1	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P209_S2	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P210_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P211_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P211_S1	We may not be able to prevent clients from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P211_S2	Because we provided investment advisory and management services on more than $ 180.8 billion in assets as of December 31, 2011 , we could face substantial liabilities if we breach our fiduciary duties.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P212_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P213_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may adversely impact our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S0	We believe ongoing economic weakness continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on consumer discretionary spending.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S1	The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as well as more recent financial and economic uncertainty, has led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies, which make up a large percentage of our client base.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S2	Some institutional clients also implemented additional review processes for new contracts or began to provide certain services, particularly investment advisory services, in-house rather than hiring external service providers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S4	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market during 2011, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P214_S5	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P215_S0	In 2010 and 2011, rising government debt levels around the world as well as downgrades in sovereign debt issues for some European countries led to market fears about a potential crisis in global sovereign debt.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P215_S1	Some European countries have been unable to successfully refinance their debts, leading European finance officials to take measures during 2010 and 2011 to stabilize financial conditions across Europe.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P216_S0	Although sovereign debt problems have been most severe in countries such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, concerns have also grown about the stability of Europe as a whole and the future of the euro currency.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P217_S0	In 2011, approximately 16.3% of our consolidated revenue was from Europe, including 7.8% in Continental Europe and 8.5% in the United Kingdom.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P217_S1	Our European operations are also subject to currency risk related to the euro, which accounted for approximately 6.1% of our consolidated revenue in 2011 and approximately 9.2% of our cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P217_S2	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P217_S3	Our reported revenue could suffer if the euro declines relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P218_S0	In addition, If financial markets around the world experience negative performance and volatility, demand for our products and services may decline, and our revenue, operating income, and other financial results could suffer.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P218_S1	Our business results may also be impacted by negative trends in Internet advertising sales.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P218_S2	The financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, that are beyond our control.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P219_S0	Changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations, compliance failures, or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P220_S0	Our investment advisory operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P220_S1	Our acquisitions of Ibbotson Associates in 2006 and Intech Pty Ltd (now known as Ibbotson Associates Australia) in 2009 substantially increased our business in this area.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P220_S2	We also expanded our investment advisory operations with our 2010 acquisitions of Old Broad Street Research Ltd. in the United Kingdom and Seeds Group in France.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P221_S0	The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P221_S1	The activities of our investment advisory operations are primarily subject to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P221_S2	In addition, our investment management business is conducted through a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P221_S3	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations may be subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P222_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P222_S1	We began publishing credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P223_S0	Although our corporate credit rating business is not currently regulated as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P223_S1	We cannot predict the future impact of potential future regulatory changes on our corporate credit rating business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P224_S0	We also expanded our credit rating business operations with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC), an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P224_S1	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to the requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P224_S2	Such requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P225_S0	As of result of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examinations by the SEC.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P226_S0	It is difficult to predict the future effect of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P226_S1	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P226_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P227_S0	Our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines as well as the effect of cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P228_S0	In 2011 , revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 13% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P228_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P228_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P228_S3	The size of these portfolios can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P228_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P229_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about our users.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P230_S0	Customers routinely input personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P230_S1	We also handle an increasing volume of personally sensitive information through our Portfolio Management Service, Enterprise Data Management, managed retirement accounts, and other areas of our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P230_S2	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, portfolio holdings, or credit card information.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P231_S0	An outage of our database and network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other office equipment, much of which is geographically concentrated in our Chicago headquarters or elsewhere in the Chicago area.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S4	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures or disruptions, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P232_S5	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P233_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P233_S1	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P233_S2	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P234_S0	Our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P234_S1	Any failures or disruptions could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P235_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P235_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or increased government regulation.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P235_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P236_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 28 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S1	We believe these proprietary tools continue to provide us with a competitive advantage, but if tools similar to them become more broadly available through other channels, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S2	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S3	Because of lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms, we believe the barriers to entry for new competitors have declined, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S4	Smaller companies may also be able to introduce new research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P237_S5	We cannot guarantee that we will continue to successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P238_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally impacting the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S2	Examples include the shift from local network to computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S3	While some of these changes may offer business opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet the rapidly changing technology landscape.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S4	We believe our history of rapid technological innovation and expertise in technology have historically given us a competitive advantage.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S5	As mentioned above, though, we believe that lower technology costs and growth in open software platforms have lowered barriers to entry for new competitors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P239_S6	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P240_S0	Increases in our cost structure related to hiring, benefit costs, salary levels, bonus expense, and other factors may reduce growth in operating income and prevent our operating margin from reaching higher levels.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S0	We have made significant investments in our employee base in recent years.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S1	Our total number of employees has increased to 3,465 as of December 31, 2011 more than double the total as of five years ago.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S2	We have also made adjustments to some employee salaries to remain competitive, and benefit costs have also increased.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S3	As a result, total compensation-related expense increased to 44.2% of revenue in 2011, up from 42.6% of revenue in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S4	In addition to higher compensation-related expense, we have also had additional operating expense from acquired operations, including amortization of intangible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S5	At the same time, some of the higher-margin projects we previously benefited from have not recurred.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S6	For example, the period covered by the Global Analyst Research Settlement ended in July 2009, and two of our larger consulting clients elected not to renew when their contract periods expired in 2008 and 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S7	As a result, our operating margin declined to 21.9% for the year ending December 31, 2011, down from a peak of 27.6% in 2008.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P241_S8	We cannot predict whether our operating margin will be able to reach similar levels in the future.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P242_S0	Competition could reduce our share of the investment research market and hurt our financial performance.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P243_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment research providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P243_S1	We compete with many different types of companies that vary in size, product scope, and media focus, including large and well-established distributors of financial information, such as Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; Thomson Reuters; and Yahoo!.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P243_S2	We compete with a variety of other companies in different areas of our business, which we discuss in greater detail in the Business Segments, Products, and Services section in Item 1-Business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P244_S0	Many of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P244_S1	This may allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for products and services, devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services, and make more attractive offers to potential clients, subscribers, and strategic partners.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P244_S2	Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P244_S3	Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P245_S0	The investment information industry is dominated by a few large players, and industry consolidation has increased in the past several years.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P245_S1	If providers of data and investment analysis continue to consolidate, our competitive position may suffer.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P246_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P247_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is generated from products and services related to mutual funds.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P248_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P248_S1	Global mutual fund assets declined to about $23.1 trillion as of September 30, 2011, down from a peak of $26.1 trillion in 2007.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P249_S0	The worldwide fund industry continued to suffer from general uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P249_S1	Preliminary figures for December indicate that long-term mutual funds suffered approximately $160 billion in outflows in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P250_S0	Despite positive returns for stocks overall during 2011, equity-focused funds have continued to experience net cash outflows, suggesting that investors remain cautious about equity-related assets.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P250_S1	While fixed-income funds had approximately $70 billion in net inflows during 2011, equity funds had net outflows of about $225 billion.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P251_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P251_S1	In addition, Morningstar is best known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P252_S0	Over the past several years, passively managed index funds have seen strong investor interest.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P252_S1	This trend continued in 2011, as passively managed vehicles had nearly $200 billion in net inflows, compared with $7 billion of net outflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P252_S2	This increased the market share of passively managed products by 2% to 25%, suggesting less demand for research on active managers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P253_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could reduce investor interest and investment activity in this area.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P253_S1	A slower growth rate or downturn in mutual fund assets or a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P254_S0	Our operations outside of the United States are expanding and involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P255_S0	Our operations outside of the United States have expanded to $184.9 million in revenue in 2011 from $157.1 million million in 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P255_S1	Several of our recent acquisitions have added to our business operations in Europe, Australia, and other areas outside the United States, and we recently established a business presence in Latin America.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P256_S0	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P256_S1	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P257_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P257_S1	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P257_S2	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P257_S3	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, our financial results are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P258_S0	The increasing concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative impact on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P259_S0	We now have approximately 900 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fourth of our total workforce.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P259_S1	Over the past several years, we have moved a significant percentage of our data collection and development operations to this location.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P260_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, we cannot predict the level of political and regulatory risk that may affect our operations.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P260_S1	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P260_S2	Any difficulties that we face in successfully maintaining our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide, particularly because of our increasing reliance on this facility.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P261_S0	We have approximately 315 employees who work at our data collection facilities in Mumbai and New Delhi, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_12_ITEM1_P261_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P262_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P263_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on corporate credit issuers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P263_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P263_S2	We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P264_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P264_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P264_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P265_S0	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P266_S0	We may be unable to generate adequate returns on our cash and investment balance if we cannot identify attractive investment opportunities.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P267_S0	We held a total of $470.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM1_P268_S0	Because of generally low prevailing interest rates on high-quality fixed-income securities, the rate of return we can generate with our cash and investment balance is relatively low.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P268_S1	We have used portions of our cash and investment balance to finance acquisitions over the past several years.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P268_S2	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities in the future.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P268_S3	We may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from an acquisition to earn a return on the associated purchase price.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P269_S0	The availability of free or low-cost investment information could lead to lower demand for our products and adversely affect our financial results.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P270_S0	Investment research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds is widely available for little or no cost from various sources, including the Internet and public libraries.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P270_S1	Investors can also access information directly from publicly traded companies and mutual funds.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P271_S0	The SEC website provides real-time access to SEC filings, including annual, semi-annual, and quarterly reports.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P271_S1	Financial information and data is also widely available in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), and many brokerage firms provide financial and investment research to their clients.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P272_S0	The widespread availability of free or low-cost investment information may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase the prices we charge for our publications and services and could lead to a lower demand for our products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P272_S1	A loss of a significant number of customers would hurt our financial results.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P273_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P274_S0	We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P274_S1	These organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P274_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P275_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P275_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P275_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P275_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P275_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P276_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P277_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P277_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P277_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers, or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P277_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P278_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P278_S1	It is possible that our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P278_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P278_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P279_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P279_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S0	We believe that independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S1	We offer products and services to our institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S2	Our institutional clients have generated a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue in recent years.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S3	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S4	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P280_S5	The fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services, as well as the fact that in some cases we make investment recommendations within the framework of client constraints, may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P281_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P281_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P282_S0	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us (either intentionally or inadvertently) could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P283_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P284_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P285_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 50% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P285_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P285_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P285_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P286_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S2	A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs, office leases, and other infrastructure spending, which generally cannot be adjusted quickly.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S3	Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S4	If actual revenue falls below our expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S5	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S6	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P287_S7	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P288_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P289_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P289_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P289_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P289_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P289_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P290_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P291_S0	In the past, we've granted options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P291_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P291_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 1,217,411 shares of common stock, 1,125,210 of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $18.84 per share.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P291_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , there were 761,119 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 32 months.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P292_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P292_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and shares are issued when restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P292_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P293_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P293_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P294_S0	Stock option exercises, share repurchases, and other factors may create volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P295_S0	Part of our cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P295_S1	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised if the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise) exceeds the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P295_S2	Similarly, excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock at vesting is greater than the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P295_S3	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P296_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be realized.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P296_S1	Because of this uncertainty, there may be additional volatility in our cash flows from financing activities.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P297_S0	In addition, our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P297_S1	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that management deems appropriate.
1289419_12_ITEM1_P297_S2	Changes in the amount of repurchase activity from period to period may also cause volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , we leased approximately 302,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our office located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 321,000 square feet of office space in 24 other countries around the world, including 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The claims against Morningstar relate to a 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	Morningstar is aware of 13 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	As part of that investigation, Morningstar has been responding to discovery requests and has had discussions with the Receiver.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	The Receiver has not filed a case against Morningstar, and Morningstar does not know whether a case will be filed.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	The separate Klass Matter was filed in September 2011 against LG, Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, in which plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P3_S4	Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the action.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	Morningstar believes the allegations against it have no legal or factual basis and plans to re-file its motion to dismiss the case once the stay is lifted.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	While Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	In November 2010, InvestPic, LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Morningstar, Inc. and several other companies alleging that each defendant infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,349,291, which relates to methods for performing statistical analysis on investment data and displaying the analyzed data in graphical form.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	InvestPic seeks, among other things, unspecified damages because of defendants' alleged infringing activities and costs.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	While Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC) and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Morningstar Credit Ratings for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones's request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar's corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P7_S3	Morningstar Credit Ratings and Morningstar continue to vigorously contest liability on all of Egan-Jones' claims for damages.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P7_S4	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P8_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P8_S1	Business Logic is alleging that Ibbotson Associates and Morningstar violated Business Logic's rights by using its trade secrets to develop a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P8_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P8_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P9_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson Associates are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P10_S0	In December 2004, Morningstar Associates, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc., received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General's office seeking information and documents related to an investigation the New York Attorney General's office is conducting.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P10_S1	The subpoena asked for documents relating to the investment consulting services the company offers to retirement plan providers, including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P10_S2	Morningstar Associates has provided the requested information and documents.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P11_S0	In 2005, Morningstar Associates received subpoenas seeking information and documents related to investigations being conducted by the SEC and United States Department of Labor.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P11_S1	The subpoenas were similar in scope to the New York Attorney General subpoena.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P12_S0	In January 2007 and September 2009, respectively, the SEC and Department of Labor each notified Morningstar Associates that it had ended its investigation, with no enforcement action, fines, or penalties.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P13_S0	In January 2007, Morningstar Associates received a Notice of Proposed Litigation from the New York Attorney General's office.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P13_S1	The Notice centers on disclosure relating to an optional service offered to retirement plan sponsors (employers) that select 401(k) plan services from ING, one of Morningstar Associates' clients.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P13_S2	The Notice gave Morningstar Associates the opportunity to explain why the New York Attorney General's office should not institute proceedings.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P13_S3	Morningstar Associates promptly submitted its explanation and has cooperated fully with the New York Attorney General's office.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P14_S0	We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of this matter, which may include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P14_S1	We also cannot predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P15_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with the matters described above because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P16_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_12_ITEM3_P16_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN .
1289419_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 17, 2012, the last reported price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $61.61 per share, and there were approximately 1,527 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	In September 2010, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	The first quarterly dividend was paid on January 14, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	We paid a dividend during each quarter of 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P3_S3	On December 9, 2011 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on January 31, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 13, 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM5_P3_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , we recorded a liability for dividends payable of $5,009,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table shows the dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	See Note 10 in our Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2011 and during the three months ended December 31, 2011:
1289419_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	_________________________________________________ * Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) In September 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $100 million of the outstanding common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	In December 2011, the board approved an increase to this program.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P9_S2	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_12_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 6, 2012:
1289419_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter, Steve Kaplan's and David Williams' previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plans expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P11_S1	During the first quarter of 2012, Cheryl Francis' and Don Phillips' previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 plans expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares each identified director and executive officer will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans identified above.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2011, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2012 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P12_S3	Each director and executive officer identified in the table may amend or terminate his or her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P13_S0	(2) Consists of two Rule 10b5-1 sales plans, one for Bevin and one for her spouse.
1289419_12_ITEM5_P13_S1	Projected beneficial ownership also includes shares owned by her spouse.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as restated, that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations (organic revenue) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
1289419_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	We present this measure because we believe it makes it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1289419_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	We began granting restricted stock units in May 2006 and have made additional grants each year since then.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P4_S2	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	Beginning in 2010, we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of Realpoint.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P5_S1	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P5_S2	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P5_S3	The expense in 2011 includes $0.4 million for accelerated vesting of a portion of these restricted stock grants.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	We estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P6_S1	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P7_S0	The total expense for stock-based compensation is distributed with other employee compensation costs in the appropriate operating expense categories of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P7_S1	Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based compensation.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P8_S0	(3) Cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions; purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments; and capital expenditures.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P8_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P8_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P9_S0	(4) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P9_S1	These cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program which we began in the fourth quarter of 2010 and dividend payments.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P9_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P10_S0	(5) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P10_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P10_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P10_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P10_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P11_S0	(6) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_12_ITEM6_P11_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others, general industry conditions and competition, including current global financial uncertainty; the impact of market volatility on revenue from asset-based fees; damage to our reputation resulting from claims made about possible conflicts of interest; liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties; financial services industry consolidation; a prolonged outage of our database and network facilities; challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations; and the availability of free or low-cost investment information.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We offer an extensive line of data, software, and research products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also offer asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Morningstar has two operating segments: Investment Information and Investment Management.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	These products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Investment Management segment includes our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Over our 28-year history, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing products.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	From 2006 through 2010, we also completed 24 acquisitions to support our five key growth strategies, which are:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Expand our international brand presence, products, and services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We sell many of our offerings, such as newsletters, Principia software, and Premium service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	Several of our other products are sold through license agreements, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Equity Research, Morningstar Direct, Retirement Solutions, Licensed Data and some of our structured credit research and ratings offerings.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P8_S5	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	For some of our other institutional services, mainly Investment Consulting, we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We also earn fees relating to Morningstar Managed Portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Overall, revenue tied to asset-based fees accounted for about 13% of our consolidated revenue in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	We frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	As a result, we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models, and as a result, we acquired their deferred revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $155.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and $146.3 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments, through multiple media, and in many geographical markets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	In general, our businesses have high fixed costs, and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	We believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower, particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	At times, we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short-term operating results.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	When revenue decreases, however, the operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold, development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage, printing, and CD-ROM replication, as well as shareholder servicing fees for Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	This category includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software, which is generally three years, and include this expense in depreciation and amortization.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing programs to promote our products.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	This category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment's management team, as well as human resources, finance, and support employees for each segment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs, including corporate systems, finance and accounting, legal, and facilities expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our capital expenditures consist of computers, leasehold improvements, and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	We amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	We have majority-owned operations in 25 countries outside of the United States and include these in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We account for our minority-owned investments in Japan and Sweden using the equity method.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value-the value of the company's future cash flows, discounted to their worth in today's dollars.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price, or to take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not be in the long-term interest of building shareholder value.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Organic revenue is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate a retention rate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	We use two different methods for calculating retention.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	For subscription-based products (including our print newsletters, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and Principia software), we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	The retention rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Global markets posted disappointing returns in 2011 as investors wrestled with uncertainty stemming from the European debt crisis, lackluster economic recovery, and monetary tightening in key emerging markets like China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Markets were characterized by sharp volatility, and investors gravitated towards safer asset classes, such as long-term Treasuries, high-quality dividend stocks, and gold.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Following strong market gains in 2010, the U.S. market finished 2011 with only a slight positive return.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year up only 1.6%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	However, the Developed Ex-U.S. Index and the Emerging Markets Index fared much worse--losing 11.4% and 17.9% in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Total U.S. mutual fund assets declined to $11.6 trillion as of December 31, 2011, compared with $11.8 trillion as of December 31, 2010, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were slightly positive for the year, investors continued to heavily favor fixed-income funds rather than equity funds.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	U.S. stock funds suffered about $85 billion in net outflows during 2011, based on Morningstar's analysis of fund flow trends, while fixed-income funds had more than $100 billion in net inflows.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend, with total assets increasing but asset flows favoring fixed-income funds.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	This trend continued in 2011, as passively managed vehicles had nearly $200 billion in net inflows, compared with $5 billion of net inflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The number of mutual funds in the United States was essentially unchanged (excluding multiple share classes), with about 7,600 funds in both 2011 and 2010 based on data from the ICI.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The number of global mutual funds increased to about 72,000 as of September 30, 2011, compared with 69,000 as of September 30, 2010, based on ICI data.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	We estimate that single-strategy hedge funds included in Morningstar's database had about $16 billion in net inflows for the year to date through November 30, 2011, up from $3 billion in net inflows through November 30, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2011 with more than $1 trillion in assets under management based on data from the ICI, up from about $990 billion at the end of 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Based on data from ComScore, aggregate page views to financial and investment sites in 2011 declined by about 9% in 2011 compared with 2010, while the number of pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit were each down roughly 15%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The number of unique visitors, meanwhile, was down about 1%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	We believe these trends reflect individual investors' continuing lower level of interest in financial- and investment-related content in the wake of the market downturn.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	Metrics such as pages viewed per visit and unique visitors showed similar trends for Morningstar.com, and pages per visit and time spent per visit showed larger declines.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Despite these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies was generally healthy for most of 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Magna Global, a division of Interpublic Group, estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about 17% across all industries in 2011, following a 7% increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new rules for financial services companies globally.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Many of these relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and an emphasis on "whole of market" investment solutions, is scheduled to come into effect in January 2013.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Advisors will be required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	We believe this requirement may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types, which we offer through products such as Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the European Union, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is a set of EU Directives designed to enable funds to operate across the EU based upon authorization from one state regulator.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	UCITS IV, which came into effect in July 2011, included requirements for a new Key Investor Information Document (KIID), an easy-to-read annual factsheet that replaces the Simplified Prospectus.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Every UCITS fund that is promoted to retail investors is now required to produce a KIID and issue an updated copy each year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	We believe our data and production capabilities will allow us to help fund companies produce and distribute these documents.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In Australia, the government is implementing a series of Future of Financial Advice reforms scheduled to go into effect starting in July 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Many of these related to fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) into law in July 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Dodd-Frank creates a number of new regulatory, supervisory, and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of U.S. financial markets and activities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Dodd-Frank also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action, giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	As a result, the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Dodd-Frank included a number of corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to publicly traded companies generally.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	It also included changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies granting the SEC more oversight over Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including our Morningstar Credit Ratings (formerly Realpoint) subsidiary.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	While we believe Dodd-Frank and related regulations will not have a significant effect on Morningstar (other than Morningstar Credit Ratings), we continue to monitor the potential impact on our clients.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	As noted in How We Evaluate Our Business, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Please refer to the discussion on page 48 for more detail.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years, comparing our financial results from year to year is complex.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	To make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods, we provide information on both organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations, and revenue from acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	We include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for 12 months after we complete the acquisition.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	After that, we include it in organic revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Consolidated organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The table below shows the period in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	In 2011, our consolidated revenue increased 13.7% to $631.4 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	We had $15.3 million in incremental revenue during 2011 from acquisitions completed in 2010, mainly reflecting incremental revenue from Morningstar Credit Ratings (formerly Realpoint LLC) and, to a lesser extent, from the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation (ASMC) and Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	Acquisitions contributed about 2.8 percentage points to our consolidated revenue growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	Currency movements also had a positive effect, contributing approximately 1.8 percentage points to revenue growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, the euro, and the Canadian dollar, were the primary contributors to the currency benefit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations, our consolidated revenue increased by $50.6 million , or 9.1% , in 2011 , with increases across all major product lines.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Leading the growth were Morningstar Direct, our institutional research platform, and Investment Consulting, followed by Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, Licensed Data, and Advisor Workstation.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Internet advertising from Morningstar.com, Retirement Solutions, and Structured Credit Ratings also contributed to the organic revenue increase, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	On February 17, 2012, a large Investment Consulting client notified us that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	We received about $12.4 million in revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 2% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2010, our consolidated revenue increased 15.9% to $555.4 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	We had $47.9 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year, mainly reflecting additional revenue from Logical Information Machines (LIM), Structured Credit Ratings, OBSR, and Intech Pty Limited (Intech).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Acquisitions contributed about 10 percentage points to our consolidated revenue growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	While organic revenue and acquisitions had the most significant impact on revenue in 2010, we also enjoyed a benefit of about $4.4 million from foreign currency translations, primarily in the first half of the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar were the primary contributors to the currency benefit, partially offset by the euro and, to a lesser extent, the British pound.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	In contrast, currency translations reduced revenue by nearly $9.0 million in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations, consolidated revenue increased by about $24.1 million, or 5.0% in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Higher revenue from Morningstar.com advertising sales, Morningstar Direct, and Licensed Data were the main drivers behind the revenue increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	These positive factors as well as smaller contributions from advisor software and our Investment Management products helped offset the loss of revenue associated with the Global Analyst Research Settlement (GARS), which ended in July 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	We had equity research revenue of $12.5 million related to GARS in 2009 that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Revenue from international operations increased as a percentage of total revenue in 2011 and 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our non-U.S. revenue increased to 29.3% of consolidated revenue in 2011, compared with 28.3% in 2010 and 27.0% in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Several of our 2010 and 2009 acquisitions have operations outside the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The majority of our international revenue is from Europe, Australia, and Canada.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	Acquisitions contributed $5.6 million to international revenue in 2011 and $17.0 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Foreign currency translations also had a positive effect on international revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	Foreign currency translations increased revenue by $10.1 million in 2011 and $4.4 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Excluding acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translations, non-U.S. revenue rose 7.7% in 2011 and 5.2% in 2010, reflecting stronger product sales in Europe.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	In Japan, we have a majority-owned subsidiary, Ibbotson Associates Japan K.K., and hold a minority ownership position in Morningstar Japan K.K.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Neither of these operations experienced significant disruption as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our five largest products based on revenue--Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar.com, and Morningstar Direct--made up about 59% of consolidated revenue in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	While the percentage of revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent over the past three years, the relative size of products within the top five has changed each year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Licensed Data has been our largest product for the last three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Beginning in 2011, as a part of the new Investment Management organization structure, we reviewed the revenue classification between our Investment Consulting and Retirement Solutions products.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	We reclassified the prior-year information for consistency with the current-year presentation.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	This reclassification changed the order of Advisor Workstation and Investment Consulting in our top five products in 2010, but did not have any effect on the order of our top five products in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	The following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Licensed Data, Investment Consulting, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between 90% and 95%, within the same range as 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	While aggregate renewal rates were broadly similar for both years, renewal rates for some larger products, including Licensed Data and Morningstar Advisor Workstation, were slightly lower compared with the previous year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	These declines were offset by slightly higher renewal rates for institutional software, Investment Consulting, and Retirement Solutions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2011, we estimate that our retention rate for subscription-based products, such as Principia, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and print and online newsletters, was on the higher end of the range between 65% and 70%, consistent with 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2011 , our consolidated operating expense increased $58.7 million or 13.5% .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	We completed seven acquisitions in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Because of the timing of these acquisitions, our results include operating expense that did not exist in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Incremental operating expense from acquired businesses represented approximately $13.4 million, or 23%, of the increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Higher salary expense represented approximately 55%, or $32.0 million, of the total operating expense increase in 2011, reflecting additional headcount from hiring in 2011 and the full-year salary impact of 2010 new hires, and, to a lesser extent, additional headcount from acquisitions completed in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Salary adjustments that were effective in July 2011 also contributed to the increase in salary expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	We review employee salaries annually and generally implement salary adjustments in the third quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	We had approximately 3,465 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2011 , compared with 3,225 as of December 31, 2010 and 2,605 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	About half of the increase in headcount in 2011 reflects continued hiring for our development centers in China and India, with most of the remainder in the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	The headcount growth includes about 30 employees hired in July 2011 in Chicago as part of the Morningstar Development Program, a two-year rotational training program for entry-level college graduates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately 24%, or $14.1 million, of the overall operating expense increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase in incentive compensation included higher bonus expense and an increase in sales commissions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	The increase in bonus expense was partially offset because bonuses paid in the first quarter were $0.4 million lower than the amount accrued in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	Although the net difference was $0.4 million, there were some greater differences by cost category, which we describe below.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P77_S4	Sales commission expense was up $2.8 million, primarily in the United States and Europe.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	In 2011, we reinstated some of the benefits we temporarily suspended in previous years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	This included increasing the matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, representing $2.3 million of additional expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Higher production expense, travel, and rent expense also contributed to the increase in operating expense, although to a lesser extent than the compensation-related items discussed above.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Higher data purchases for our operations in the U.S. and Europe contributed to the $4.2 million growth in production expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	The $1.5 million increase in rent expense primarily reflects higher rent for our new office space in Shenzhen, China, and, to a lesser extent, for our office space in Chicago.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	Our 2010 results included an expense of $1.0 million to increase liabilities for vacant office space.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P79_S4	This expense did not recur in 2011, partially offsetting the higher rent expense in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Intangible amortization expense increased $2.4 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase primarily reflects amortization expense from 2010 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our 2011 results includes $3.2 million of expense for a previously announced separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	Operating expense in 2010 included $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	This expense did not recur in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	We capitalized $5.3 million of operating expense in 2011, primarily for software development within the Structured Credit Ratings business, Morningstar Commodity Data, and for Morningstar Direct.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	In 2010, we capitalized $0.8 million of operating expense for software development.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.1 percentage points in 2011, as the 13.7% increase in revenue slightly outpaced the 13.5% increase in operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2010, our consolidated operating expense increased $80.0 million, or 22.6%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	We completed seven acquisitions in 2010 and six in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Because of the timing of these acquisitions, our 2010 results include operating expense that did not exist in the same periods in the previous year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	Incremental operating expense from acquired businesses represented more than half of the operating expense increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	In 2010, we restored some compensation and employee benefits after reducing them in 2009, contributing to the operating expense increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Higher salary expense represented slightly more than one-third of the total operating expense increase, reflecting higher headcount from acquisitions and filling open positions, as well as salary increases made in July 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	We had approximately 3,225 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2010, a 23.8% increase from 2,605 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	We added about 125 employees through acquisitions over the 12 months ending December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	The remainder of the increase in headcount mainly reflects continued hiring for our development centers in China and India.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately 40% of the overall operating expense increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	In early 2010, we began phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation-related expense we reduced in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	As a result, bonus expense increased $16.3 million, or 77.6%, in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Sales commissions increased $7.8 million in 2010, reflecting improved sales activity compared with 2009 as well as a change to one of our commission plans.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	Matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States increased $3.5 million in 2010 because we partially reinstated this employee benefit in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S5	In addition, healthcare benefit costs rose $2.8 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P87_S6	Operating expense in 2010 also included $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Intangible amortization expense increased $5.9 million compared with 2009, reflecting additional amortization expense from recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	While operating expense generally increased in 2010, we recorded $9.5 million of operating expense in 2009 related to adjusting the treatment of some incentive stock options and penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock-option exercises that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	In addition, the recorded expense related to increasing liabilities for vacant office declined by $2.2 million compared with the amount recorded in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased 4.2 percentage points in 2010, as the 22.6% increase in operating expense outpaced the 15.9% increase in revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense, representing more than one-third of our total operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	Approximately one-half of our employees are included in this cost category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Cost of goods sold rose $25.1 million in 2011 and $28.5 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Approximately 20% of the increase in 2011 was related to 2010 acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	Higher salaries contributed approximately 50% of the total increase in 2011, primarily from additional headcount.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	Higher production expense of $4.2 million also contributed to the increase, primarily from higher data purchases for our operations in the U.S. and Europe.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	Higher bonus expense of $3.8 million for the 2011 annual bonus was offset by a $1.6 million reduction in bonus expense related to the prior year bonus because we paid a smaller portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in this category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P92_S5	Please refer to the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Approximately 60% of the increase in 2010 was related to recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Higher salaries, bonus expense, and other compensation-related expense also contributed to the increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our gross margin declined by about 0.5 percentage points and 1.4 percentage points in 2011 and 2010, respectively, as expenses in this category increased at a faster rate compared with revenue growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Development expense increased $3.9 million in 2011 and $10.8 million in 2010 mainly because of higher salaries and compensation-related expense and bonus expense for our development teams.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	We capitalized $5.3 million of operating expense in 2011 and $0.8 million in 2010 for software development, reducing the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Development expense from recent acquisitions also contributed to the increase in 2011 and 2010, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	We had approximately 830 employees included in development expense as of December 31, 2011 compared with 760 as of December 31, 2010 and 540 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	As a percentage of revenue, development expense was down slightly in 2011 , primarily reflecting the effect of capitalizing operating expense for software development.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $11.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Approximately 17% of the growth in sales and marketing expense in the year was related to recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	Higher salary-related expense represents about 53% of the overall expense increase in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	Higher sales commission expense, other compensation-related expenses, and travel expense also contributed to the increase in the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	Lower bonus expense partially offset the increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $23.7 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	Higher sales commission expense, which rose $7.8 million in 2010, was the largest factor behind the increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	Commission expense rose partly because of improved sales activity.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	In addition, we recognized more expense in 2010 because of a change in our U.S. sales commission structure.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S4	Under this new commission plan, we record the entire commission expense in the quarter in which it is incurred.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S5	Under the previous commission structure, we recognized the commission expense over the term of the customer contract.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S6	Other costs in this category, including salaries and bonuses, and, to a lesser extent, advertising, marketing, and travel, also increased.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P99_S7	Approximately one-fourth of the increase in sales and marketing expense was related to recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down in 2011 primarily reflecting lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	General and administrative expense (G A) rose $15.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	Higher compensation-related expense including higher salaries, bonus expense, and other compensation-related expense contributed about 70% of the total increase in G A. Bonus expense included in G A increased $3.6 million in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	In the first quarter of 2011, we paid a greater portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $2.6 million of the year-to-date increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	Please refer to and the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	Higher rent expense, mainly for our office space in China and for our office space in Chicago, also contributed to the growth in G A, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	G A in 2011 includes a $0.8 million reduction in sales tax accruals and a $2.0 million business tax rebate for our operations in China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Partially offsetting these two items was $1.4 million of business tax expense related to prior years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	G A in 2011 also includes $3.2 million of expense for a previously announced separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P103_S3	Our 2010 results include $1.0 million to increase liabilities for vacant office space and $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P103_S4	These two expenses did not recur in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	G A expense increased $9.2 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Bonus expense, salaries, and other compensation-related expense contributed to the increase in 2010, as did incremental expense related to acquisition.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	G A expense in 2010 also includes $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	While most G A expense rose in 2010, certain G A expense recorded in 2009 did not recur in 2010, including the $6.1 million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options as well as $1.8 million of operating expense recorded to G A expense for the deposit penalty.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	Expenses related to liabilities for vacant office space were $2.2 million lower in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	G A as a percentage of revenue increased 0.4 percentage point in 2011 after declining 0.8 percentage points in 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Depreciation expense rose $0.8 million in 2011, primarily related to our new office space in China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	Depreciation expense increased $1.8 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	The increase in depreciation expense in 2010 reflects incremental expense from acquisitions and accelerated depreciation expense related to our existing office space in China, in advance of moving into new office space.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Amortization expense increased $2.4 million in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	The increase in 2011 primarily reflects amortization expense from 2010 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	Amortization expense increased $5.9 million in 2010, reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	We estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be $23.8 million in 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by changes to the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with additional acquisitions and currency translations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was down slightly in 2011 and up slightly in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Stock-based compensation expense relates to grants of restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs has increased over the past three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	We began granting RSUs in May 2006 and have made additional grants each year since then.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	We recognize the expense related to RSUs over the vesting period, which is four years for employees and three years for non-employee directors.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P112_S3	We estimate forfeitures for these awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the second quarter, which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P112_S4	The expense recorded in 2011 was favorably affected by $0.5 million for restricted stock units that were forfeited in the first quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Restricted Stock: Beginning in 2010, we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of Realpoint.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P113_S3	The expense in 2011 includes $0.4 million for accelerated vesting of a portion of these restricted stock grants.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Stock options: In 2011, we granted 92,201 stock options to our executive officers and non-employee directors.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	These stock options vest ratably over a four-year period for executive officers and a three-year period for non-employee directors and expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	Using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, we estimated the fair value of these grants to be approximately $2.2 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	We will amortize this value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the options' vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	We estimate forfeitures of these awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the second quarter, which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	We describe our stock-based compensation in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	Stock-based compensation is included in each of our operating expense categories, as shown below:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Based on grants of RSUs, stock options, and restricted stock made through December 31, 2011 , we anticipate that stock-based compensation expense will be $13.9 million in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	This amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or changes in our estimated forfeiture rate related to these grants.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	The size of our bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items, including changes in full-year operating income relative to the previous year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	We review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	We record bonus expense throughout the year and pay annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Bonus expense, which we include in each of our operating expense categories, increased $5.3 million in 2011 and $ 16.3 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	We reduced our bonus expense in 2009 as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue in the challenging business environment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	In 2010, we reinstated a portion of the bonus expense that was previously reduced.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	Bonus expense for newly acquired operations also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	Overall, bonus expense represented about 6.8% and 6.7% of revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively, after declining to 4.4% in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	Prior to 2009, bonus expense represented about 10% to 12% of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	The amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	Instead, the size of the bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items, including changes in full-year operating income relative to the previous year and other factors.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	We review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	We record bonus expense throughout the year and pay out annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	In 2011, the increase in the bonus expense consisted of 1) an increase of $5.7 million in bonus expense and 2) a difference of $0.4 million between the bonus amounts paid in 2011 (related to 2010 performance) compared with the annual bonus expense recorded in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	The table below presents the effect of these two factors by cost category and in total:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Although in total the 2010 bonuses paid were $0.4 million lower compared with the amount expensed in 2010, there were some larger differences by cost category.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	We paid a greater portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in the G A category compared with our initial estimate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $17.4 million in 2011 , and our margin was up slightly in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Our revenue growth of $76.0 million outpaced the increase in our costs of $58.7 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Capitalized operating expense for software development contributed 0.7 percentage points to our margin growth in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	Higher salaries and other compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset the benefit of the capitalized operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	In addition, acquisitions had a slight negative effect on the margin.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Consolidated operating income fell $3.6 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	While revenue increased $76.4 million, our cost base rose more, leading to lower operating income.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	The decline in operating income reflects higher incentive compensation, including higher bonus expense and sales commissions, modest compensation increases during the second half of 2010, and reinstating some of the employee benefits and other expenses we reduced in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P126_S3	In 2010, costs rose across all of our operating expense categories, with the exception of a $9.5 million operating expense recorded in 2009 that did not recur in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	With operating expense increasing more than revenue, our operating margin was 4.2 percentage points lower in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	The margin decline mainly reflects higher compensation, bonuses, sales commissions, and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	The loss of revenue from the Global Analyst Research Settlement (GARS) also had a negative effect on margins.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P127_S3	Acquisitions represented approximately 2 percentage points of the margin decline for the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	As we mentioned on page 52, on February 17, 2012, a large Investment Consulting client notified us that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	We received about $12.4 million in revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 2.0% of our consolidated revenue and a larger percentage of our operating income, as our consulting work generally doesn't involve significant variable costs.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P129_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	We generated positive free cash flow in in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded our level of capital expenditures, as shown below:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Free cash flow increased $33.0 million in 2011 and $19.8 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Cash provided by operating activities: Cash provided by operating activities increased $41.6 million in 2011 , reflecting the positive cash flow effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net income (adjusted for non-cash items), partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in bonuses paid in the first quarter of 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P133_S1	We made bonus payments of $37.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Cash provided by operating activities increased $22.2 million in 2010, mainly because cash paid in 2010 for bonuses was lower than in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	We made bonus payments of $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $58.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P134_S2	The positive cash flow impact of a lower bonus payment was partially offset by $4.9 million in payments we made to one former and two current executives related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options (ISOs).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P134_S3	We recorded the operating expense related to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	To provide investors with additional insight into our financial results, we provide a comparison between the change in consolidated net income and the change in operating cash flow:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	In 2011 , the increase in cash from operations exceeded the change in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily because of the positive cash flow effect of accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and income taxes current.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	In addition, the cash flow from operations in 2010 includes a $4.9 million payment related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options (ISOs).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P136_S2	This payment did not recur in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P136_S3	These items, which favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison, were partially offset by the increase in bonus payments in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P136_S4	Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also reflects $4.1 million of payments for previously announced separation agreements with two former executives.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	In 2010, cash provided by operating activities increased more than consolidated net income.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The $37.5 million decrease in bonuses paid in 2010 compared with 2009 was the primary driver behind the difference between net income and cash provided by operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity, which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	In 2011 and 2010, we classified $9.5 million and $7.5 million , respectively, of excess tax benefits as financing activities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P138_S2	We describe these excess tax benefits in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	Capital expenditures: We spent $23.3 million for capital expenditures in 2011 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed capitalized software, and leasehold improvements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	We spent $14.8 million for capital expenditures in 2010, primarily for computer hardware and leasehold improvements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	A significant portion of the capital expenditures in 2010 are for new office space in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P140_S2	This new office facility was substantially completed in early 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	In 2011 , capital expenditures increased $8.6 million , primarily for capitalized software and computer hardware and software for our U.S. operations and for our development center in China.

1289419_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	From June 2004 through July 2009, our equity research was distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the Global Analyst Research Settlement (GARS).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P150_S1	The period covered by GARS ended in July 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	Although the banks covered by GARS are no longer required to provide independent research to their clients, we entered into equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under GARS.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	In 2010, we replaced approximately one-third of the lost annual GARS revenue with other equity research business.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	The segment also includes Morningstar Credit Research and Morningstar Structured Credit Ratings.

1289419_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	Acquisitions contributed $13.5 million of revenue in 2011 , primarily from Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC and to a lesser extent from ASMC, Denmark, and OBSR.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P155_S2	Revenue from acquisitions represented approximately 3 percentage points of the revenue increase in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P155_S3	Excluding acquisitions, our software, data, and investment research product lines all contributed to the revenue growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P155_S4	Organic revenue for our software product lines was up $26.2 million, driven by Morningstar Direct, and to a lesser extent by Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar.com.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P155_S5	Licensed Data and Morningstar Credit Ratings drove the growth in revenue in our data and investment research product lines, respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Revenue for our Investment Information segment increased $58.3 million , or 15.1% , to $445.0 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	Acquisitions contributed $40.4 million of revenue in 2010, primarily from LIM, Realpoint, OBSR, and CPMS.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	Revenue from acquisitions represented approximately 10 percentage points of the revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	Excluding acquisitions, higher revenue in our software, data, and investment research products and services more than offset the loss of $12.5 million of revenue from GARS, which expired at the end of July 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P157_S2	Organic revenue for our software product lines was up approximately $18.2 million, driven by Morningstar.com, Morningstar Direct, and to a lesser extent from Advisor Workstation and Morningstar Integrated Web Tools.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	Excluding acquisitions, Morningstar Direct was the largest contributor to the increase in segment revenue in 2011 and a primary contributor to segment revenue growth in 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	Morningstar Direct contributed approximately 39% of the organic revenue growth for the segment in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 6,144 worldwide, compared with 4,773 as of December 31, 2010 and 3,524 as of December 31, 2009 , with strong growth in both the U.S. and internationally.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P158_S3	The growth reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients, and, to a lesser extent, from client migrations from both Institutional Workstation and Morningstar EnCorr to Morningstar Direct.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	Advisor software revenue increased as higher revenue from Morningstar Integrated Web Tools and Advisor Workstation (mainly Morningstar Office) more than offset slightly lower Principia revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	The number of U.S. licenses for Morningstar Advisor Workstation increased to 160,287 as of December 31, 2011 compared with 157,395 as of December 31, 2010 , and 150,473 as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P159_S2	The increase in the number of U.S. licenses compared with December 31, 2009 is partially due to incremental licenses added through our acquisition of ASMC.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	Principia subscriptions totaled 31,270 as of December 31, 2011 , down from 32,681 as of December 31, 2010 and 35,844 as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	Revenue for Morningstar.com, which includes Internet advertising and Premium Membership subscriptions, also contributed to the growth in the segment's revenue in 2011 and was the primary driver of the segment revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S1	In both years, higher Internet advertising sales for Morningstar.com were partially offset by a continued decline in Premium Membership subscriptions revenue in the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S2	Internet advertising revenue increased 21.8% in 2011 compared with 76.2% in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S3	Premium subscriptions for the U.S. version of Morningstar.com declined to 130,354 as of December 31, 2011 , compared with 138,149 as of December 31, 2010 and 150,473 as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S4	Premium subscriptions have continued declining because of a weak trial pipeline.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P161_S5	However, consistent with the trend over the past few years, we moderately increased subscription prices for U.S. Premium Membership in both January 2011 and 2010 , which partly offset the revenue decline associated with the lower subscription levels.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	Licensed Data made positive contributions to segment revenue growth in both 2011 and 2010, reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts for managed products data.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	Licensed Data gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	The data packages we offer include proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, and ownership.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	Revenue for our investment research products was up in 2011 mainly because of Structured Credit Ratings and Research.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	Within the structured credit ratings business, we had strong revenue growth earlier in the year driven by new issue rating assignments in the CMBS market.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P164_S2	In 2011, we rated 13 new issue CMBS deals, more than double the number in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P164_S3	However, mid-year market volatility and lower levels of investor risk tolerance had a negative effect on the pipeline of potential issues in the CMBS market during the second half of the year based on published industry reports.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P164_S4	Higher revenue for equity research and conferences also contributed to the growth in revenue for our investment research products, but were partially offset by a decline in newsletters revenue, primarily because of lower advertising sales for our trade magazines in Australia.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	Investment research revenue declined in 2010 reflecting the loss of $12.5 million of revenue from GARS, which expired at the end of July 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	Our post-settlement equity research revenue in 2010 replaced approximately one-third of the annual GARS revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P165_S2	We entered into new equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under GARS.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P165_S3	In addition, we're continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions through a variety of other channels.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	Revenue from other investment research products was essentially flat in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	Higher revenue from conferences and corporate credit ratings research helped offset the continuing decline in revenue from newsletters and books.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	In 2011 , operating income for the Investment Information segment increased $3.8 million , or 3.0% , as revenue grew more than operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Operating expense was up $52.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	Additional costs from acquisitions contributed approximately 18% of the increase in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S2	Higher salary-related expense and incentive compensation, including sales commission and bonus expense, contributed about 71% of the overall expense increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S3	Higher salary-related expense is from additional hiring in 2011 and the full-year salary impact of 2010 new hires, and, to a lesser extent, additional headcount from acquisitions completed in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S4	Salary adjustments that were effective in July 2011 also contributed to the increase in salary expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P168_S5	Higher employee benefits expense, including employee health benefits and matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, contributed about 9% of the increase in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	The Investment Information segment's operating margin decreased 2.4 percentage points in 2011 , primarily from higher salary expense as a percentage of revenue, and, to a lesser extent, employee benefit expense and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	Higher salary expense contributed 2.0 percentage points to the decline in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	Acquisitions had only a minor effect on the segment margin.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	In 2010, operating income for the Investment Information segment decreased $10.7 million, or 7.7%, as operating expense increased more than revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Operating expense was up $69.0 million in 2010, with additional costs from acquisitions contributing approximately 45% of the increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P172_S1	Higher salaries (reflecting expanded headcount) and incentive compensation (including bonus and sales commission expense) also contributed to the increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P172_S2	Bonus expense increased $10.9 million in 2010, including incremental bonus expense from recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P172_S3	An increase in employee benefits expense, including employee healthcare benefits and the partial reinstatement of matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	Operating margin for the Investment Information segment declined 7.1 percentage points in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	Approximately 6.4 percentage points of the margin decline reflects higher compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	Acquisitions had a slightly negative impact on the margin.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Investment Management segment includes all of our asset management operations, which earn the majority of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	The key products and services in this segment based on revenue are Investment Consulting, which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds, including mutual funds and variable annuities; Retirement Solutions, including the Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson platforms; and Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons, risk levels, and investment strategies that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax-deferred accounts.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	Our Investment Consulting business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S5	The method of calculation varies by client; some contracts include provisions for calculating average assets based on daily data, while others use weekly or monthly data.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P177_S6	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	In our Retirement Solutions business, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	Our Retirement Solutions business also includes plan sponsor and custom target date consulting arrangements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P178_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement in these arrangements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Consulting and Retirement Solutions businesses because our fee structures vary by client.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range would be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P179_S2	We disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our periodic filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P180_S1	Fees for our mutual fund and ETF portfolios generally range from 30 to 40 basis points.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P180_S2	We charge fees of 55 basis points for our customized stock portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	This segment represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	Investment Management segment revenue increased $20.1 million , or 18.2% , in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	Revenue from acquisitions was $1.9 million , primarily from the OBSR and Seeds acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S2	Excluding acquisitions, revenue was up across all three of our key product and service lines in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S3	Investment Consulting was the primary driver of the revenue increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S4	Higher revenue in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe was partially offset by a decline in Investment Consulting revenue in Australia.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S5	Retirement Solutions and Managed Portfolios also contributed to the revenue increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S6	On February 17, 2012, a large Investment Consulting client notified us that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P182_S7	We received about $12.4 million in revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 9.5% of Investment Management segment revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	Investment Management segment revenue increased $18.0 million, or 19.5%, in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P183_S1	Acquisitions contributed $7.5 million of revenue in 2010, primarily from the Intech and OBSR acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P183_S2	Excluding acquisitions, revenue increased across all product categories in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	Retirement Solutions was the main driver of the revenue increase in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	We primarily earn license-based fees for the advice and guidance services we provide through our Retirement Solutions platform.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P185_S1	Revenue for these services increased in 2010 primarily because of Advice by Ibbotson, after declining in 2009 because of several smaller client non-renewals.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P185_S2	Managed Portfolios and Investment Consulting also contributed to the revenue increase in 2010, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P185_S3	Higher revenue from Investment Consulting in 2010 was partially offset by a client non-renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	We had $81.7 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2011, an increase of $14.0 million compared with $67.7 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	In 2009, revenue from asset-based fees was $56.0 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 13% of consolidated revenue in 2011, up slightly from 12% in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P186_S3	Within the Investment Management segment, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 60% of segment revenue over the past three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	Total assets under advisement and management were $180.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 , an increase from $149.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $100.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S1	About $22 billion of the total assets as of December 31, 2011 reflects additional assets for existing clients' fund-of-funds programs for which we now receive asset-based fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S2	The increase in assets represents incremental growth for an existing revenue stream.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S3	Similarly, about $39 billion of the total assets as of December 31, 2010 reflected a new fund-of-funds program that began in May 2010 for an existing Morningstar Associates client.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S4	Previously, Morningstar created model portfolios for the same client, so the increase in assets represented incremental growth for an existing revenue stream.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P187_S5	Excluding assets from these fund-of-fund programs, total assets under advisement and management increased in 2011 and 2010, reflecting net client inflows and market performance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	The asset totals as of the end of each year don't fully reflect the change in average asset levels during the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	The asset-based fees we earn are primarily based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P188_S2	Average assets under advisement and management (calculated based on available quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $165.3 million in 2011, up 39.3% from $118.7 billion in 2010 and up 75.9% from $94.0 billion in 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	We provided Investment Consulting advisory services on $140.4 billion in assets as of December 31, 2011 compared with $111.4 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010 and $64.8 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P190_S1	We also provide Investment Consulting services for some assets for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	As mentioned above, we manage several fund of funds portfolios for a large Investment Consulting client who recently notified us that it will be moving management of these portfolios in-house in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P191_S1	These portfolios represented $12.3 billion, or 8.4%, of our Investment Consulting assets under advisement and management as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	Assets under advisement and management rose $29.0 billion , or 26.0% , compared with December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P193_S1	Approximately 75% of the increase reflects additional assets for existing clients' fund-of-funds programs for which we now receive asset-based fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P193_S2	The remainder of the increase reflects net client inflows and market performance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	Total assets under advisement and management for Investment Consulting as of December 31, 2010 increased 71.9% compared with December 31, 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P194_S1	As mentioned above, assets under advisement as of December 31, 2010 includes approximately $39 billion related to a new fund-of-funds program that began in May 2010 for an existing Morningstar Associates client.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P194_S2	Excluding assets from the new fund-of-funds program, assets under advisement for Investment Consulting increased slightly over 2009, mainly reflecting positive market performance partially offset by a client non-renewal that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	We cannot separately quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios because we do not have custody of the assets in the majority of our investment management businesses.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P195_S1	The information we receive from many of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P195_S2	We also cannot precisely quantify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	Assets under management for managed retirement accounts increased to $19.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared with $ 19.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $ 15.7 billion as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	Assets under advisement for plan sponsor and custom target-date arrangements increased to $17.5 billion as of December 31, 2011 , compared with $ 15.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $ 17.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	We cannot separately quantify the factors affecting assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P197_S1	These factors primarily consist of employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P197_S2	We cannot quantify the impact of these other factors because the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	The table below shows the number of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through our Retirement Solutions programs, as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios contributed $2.4 million to the segment s revenue increase in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P199_S1	The higher revenue mainly reflects higher average asset levels during the 2011 compared with 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P199_S2	Assets under management for Morningstar Managed Portfolios were $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2011 , compared with $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 , reflecting net inflows.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P200_S0	Operating income for the Investment Management segment increased $12.8 million , or 22.6% , in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P200_S1	In 2010, operating income increased $3.9 million, or 7.4%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P200_S2	In both years, revenue increased more than operating expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S0	Operating expense in the segment rose $7.3 million , or 13.6% , in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S1	Additional costs from acquisitions contributed approximately 25% of the total operating expense increase in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S2	Excluding acquisitions, higher operating expenses for operations outside of the United States contributed the majority of the operating expense increase.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S3	Higher salaries and higher professional fees also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S4	Bonus expense was essentially unchanged from the prior year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S5	Operating expense in 2010 included $2.0 million related to a separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P201_S6	This expense did not recur in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S0	In 2010, operating expense in this segment rose $14.1 million, or 35.8%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S1	Approximately 40% of the segment's operating expense increase reflects recent acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S2	Higher salaries and incentive compensation, including bonuses and sales commissions, contributed approximately two-thirds of the overall operating expense increase in this segment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S3	Bonus expense rose $4.2 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S4	Sales commissions and employee benefits, including employee healthcare benefits and matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, also increased, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S5	Operating expense in 2010 also included $2.0 million related to a separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P202_S6	A slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our Advice by Ibbotson service partially offset these increases.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P203_S0	Operating margin increased 1.9 percentage points to 53.4% in 2011 , as revenue growth exceeded the growth in operating expenses.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P203_S1	Lower salary expense and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue contributed to the increase, partially offset by higher expenses outside of the United Stated and higher professional fees as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P203_S2	In addition, acquisitions had a small negative effect on the margin in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P203_S3	The 2010 margin was negatively impacted by the $2.0 million separation agreement.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P203_S4	This separation agreement reduced the 2010 margin by approximately 2.0 percentage points.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P204_S0	The segment's operating margin decreased 5.8 percentage points to 51.5% in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P204_S1	The margin decline mainly reflects higher bonus expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P204_S2	The $2.0 million separation payment reduced the margin by approximately 2.0 percentage points.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P204_S3	Salaries and employee benefits also contributed to the margin decline, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P204_S4	In addition, acquisitions had a negative impact on the margin of approximately 1.6 percentage points.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P205_S0	As previously discussed, a large Investment Consulting client recently notified us that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P205_S1	We received about $12.4 million in revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 9.5% of Investment Management segment revenue and a larger percentage of segment operating income, as our consulting work generally doesn't involve significant variable costs.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P206_S0	This category includes general corporate costs, which we do not allocate to our business segments.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P206_S1	The corporate items category also includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded for acquisitions and capitalization of internal product development costs.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P206_S2	The table below shows the components of corporate items that affected our consolidated operating income:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P207_S0	Amortization of intangible assets increased $2.4 million in 2011 and $5.9 million in 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P207_S1	The increase in 2011 primarily reflects amortization expense from 2010 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P207_S2	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P207_S3	Amortization expense increased $5.9 million in 2010, reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P208_S0	We paid $176.2 million for acquisitions during the past three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P208_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , respectively, we had $139.8 million and $169.0 million of net intangible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P208_S2	We amortize these assets over their estimated lives, ranging from one to 20 years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P208_S3	We estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be approximately $23.8 million in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P209_S0	Depreciation expense for corporate items did not change significantly in 2011 or 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S0	Corporate unallocated expense decreased $3.3 million in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S1	In 2011, we capitalized $5.3 million of expense for software development, compared with $0.8 million in 2010, favorably impacting the year-over-year comparison.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S2	Lower professional fees also contributed to the decrease, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S3	In addition, a $1.0 million expense related to vacant office space recorded in 2010 did not recur in 2011 , favorably affecting the comparison with the prior year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S4	Higher salaries partially offset the these favorable items.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P210_S5	In addition, our corporate unallocated expense for 2011 includes $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P211_S0	Corporate unallocated expense decreased $8.9 million in 2010 , as some expenses recorded in 2009 did not recur in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P211_S1	Corporate unallocated expense in 2009 includes $9.5 million of expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options and deposit penalties.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P211_S2	In 2010, expense related to liabilities for vacant office space declined $2.2 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P211_S3	In addition, in 2010, we capitalized approximately $0.8 million of operating expense for software development.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P211_S4	These factors, which favorably impact the year-over-year comparison, were partially offset by incremental expense from acquisitions, higher compensation and bonus expense, and higher professional fees.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P212_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK), Morningstar Sweden AB, and, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, YCharts, Inc. (YCharts).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P212_S1	In the first six months of 2010, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P212_S2	In 2009, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Denmark and Morningstar Korea.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P212_S3	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities is primarily from our position in MJKK.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P213_S0	In November 2011, we acquired a 20% minority equity stake in YCharts for $2.45 million, paid in cash.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P214_S0	In July 2010, we acquired an additional 75% ownership interest in Morningstar Danmark A/S (Morningstar Denmark), increasing our ownership percentage to 100%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P214_S1	As a result, we no longer account for our investment in Morningstar Denmark using the equity method.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P214_S2	Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Morningstar Denmark in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P215_S0	In 2009, we acquired an additional 40% ownership interest in Morningstar Korea, increasing our ownership percentage to 80%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P215_S1	As a result, we no longer account for our investment in Morningstar Korea using the equity method.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P216_S0	In September 2009, we began consolidating the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Morningstar Korea in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P217_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P218_S0	The following table presents the components of net non-operating income (expense):
1289419_12_ITEM7_P219_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P219_S1	Interest income in 2011 increased compared with 2010, primarily due to higher balances of cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P219_S2	The decrease in interest income in 2010 reflects lower returns on our invested balances during the year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P220_S0	In 2011, interest expense includes $0.9 million related to the $1.4 million of business tax expense for prior years recorded in 2011, as discussed above in the section Consolidated Results .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S0	Other income (expense), net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S1	It also includes royalty income from MJKK and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S2	The net other expense in 2011 primarily represents unrealized exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S3	In 2010, we recorded a holding gain of approximately $4.6 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S4	This gain represented the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark at the date of acquisition.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P221_S5	In 2009, we recorded a holding gain of approximately $0.4 million when we increased our ownership in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P222_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P223_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P224_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2011 was 30.7% , a decrease of 2.4 percentage points compared with 33.1% in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P224_S1	The lower tax rate in 2011 reflects the positive effect of increased tax credits and incentives related to Morningstar's research and development activities and our domestic production activities (Section 199) deduction, some of which relate to prior years, effects of tax audit settlements, and the recognition of certain deferred income tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P224_S2	Additionally, in 2010, the use of foreign net operating losses that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance reduced our effective tax rate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P224_S3	This benefit did not recur in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P225_S0	In 2010, our effective tax rate was 33.1%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P225_S1	The lower tax rate in 2010 reflects the positive impact of certain income tax benefits, including the difference between U.S. federal and foreign tax rates, tax credits related to Morningstar's research and development activities, and the use of foreign net operating losses that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P225_S2	These items favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately 3.7 percentage points in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P226_S0	Income tax expense in 2010 includes approximately $1.7 million of non-cash expense related to the $4.6 million holding gain we recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P226_S1	This income tax expense did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P227_S0	In 2011, we recorded a net increase of $3.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which increased our income tax expense.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P227_S1	The majority of this increase relates to the estimated tax benefits and incentives (discussed above).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P227_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we had $12.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $11.9 million , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $9.8 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P227_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we had $9.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $8.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $6.9 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P228_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of approximately $5.3 million and a non-current liability of $6.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P228_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $0.7 million and a non-current liability of $8.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P228_S2	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P229_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P229_S1	Approximately 20% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2011 are held by our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P229_S2	As such, we believe that our cash balances and investments in the United States, along with cash generated from our U.S. operations, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future, without requiring us to repatriate earnings from these foreign subsidiaries.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P230_S0	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P231_S0	We are currently under audit by federal and various state and local tax authorities in the United States, as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P231_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these audits will conclude in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P232_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P233_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S0	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S1	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high-quality stand-alone credit ratings.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S2	We also invest a small portion of our investments balance (less than 5% as of December 31, 2011) in proprietary Morningstar portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S3	These portfolios may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S4	Investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years; the weighted average maturity is approximately one year.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P234_S5	Approximately 80% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2011 are held by our operations in the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P235_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P235_S1	To date, we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S0	In 2011 , we paid dividends of $10.0 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S1	On December 9, 2011 , our board of directors approved a payment of a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share payable on January 31, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 13, 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we recorded a liability for dividends payable of $5.0 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S3	We expect to make a recurring quarterly dividend payment of 10 cents per share in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S4	In February 2012 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P236_S5	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2012 to shareholders of record as of April 13, 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P237_S0	In December 2011, the board approved an increase to the $100 million share repurchase program it announced in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P237_S1	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P237_S2	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P237_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , we had repurchased a total of 798,337 shares for $44.5 million under this authorization.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P238_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $470.2 million, an increase of $104.8 million compared with $365.4 million as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P238_S1	The increase reflects $165.0 million of cash provided by operating activities and $18.2 million of cash from stock-option proceeds and excess tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P238_S2	These items, which increased our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance, were partially offset by $40.7 million used to repurchase common stock through our share repurchase program, $23.3 million of capital expenditures, and $10.0 million of dividends paid.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P239_S0	We expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2012 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $43 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P240_S0	Our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P241_S0	In 2011 , cash provided by operating activities was $165.0 million, driven by $142.6 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of $22.4 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P241_S1	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities mainly benefited from an increase in accrued compensation and an increase in income taxes.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P241_S2	The growth in accrued compensation primarily reflects the bonus liability as of year-end, partially offset by the bonus payments made in the first quarter of 2011 of approximately $37.5 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P241_S3	The cash flow benefit of income taxes was partially offset by tax payments of $38.1 million made during 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P241_S4	Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also reflects $4.1 million of payments for previously announced separation agreements with two former executives.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P242_S0	In 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $123.4 million, driven by $127.0 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by $3.5 million in changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P242_S1	We paid $21.4 million in annual bonus payments in the first quarter of 2010 and made tax payments of approximately $37.6 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P242_S2	In addition, in 2010, we paid $4.9 million to one former and two current executives to adjust the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P242_S3	The cash flow impact of these items was partially offset by the cash flow benefits of accrued compensation and income taxes payable.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P243_S0	In 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $101.3 million, driven by $115.0 million of net income (adjusted for non-cash items) partially offset by $13.7 million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities, mainly driven by bonus payments.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P243_S1	We paid $58.9 million for bonuses in 2009, including $10.0 million in deferred payments from 2007.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P243_S2	The cash flow impact of these payments was partially offset by the cash flow benefit from accrued compensation for the 2009 bonuses.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P244_S0	Cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments less proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments, and cash used for capital expenditures.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P244_S1	The level of investing activities varies from period to period depending on activity in these three categories.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P245_S0	Cash used for investing activities was $110.8 million in 2011 , $87.9 million in 2010 , and $174.7 million in 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S0	In 2011 , purchases of investments exceeded the proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments by $85.3 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S1	In contrast, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by $28.6 million in 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S2	In 2010, we transferred funds from our investment portfolio to cash and cash equivalents to pay for acquisitions made in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S3	Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments, were $83.9 million in 2009 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S4	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , we had investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities, of $269.8 million and $185.2 million, respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P246_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , our investments represented 57% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance compared with 51% as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P247_S0	Capital expenditures were $23.3 million , $14.8 million , and $12.4 million in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P247_S1	The 2011 capital expenditures reflect spending on computer hardware and software and internally developed capitalized software for our U.S. office as well as remaining payments for our development center in China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P247_S2	The 2010 capital expenditures include spending for our office space in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P247_S3	Capital expenditures in 2009 include final payments for the build-out of our new headquarters in Chicago and investment for a couple of our office locations in Europe.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P247_S4	We expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately $25 million in 2012, primarily for computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations, and capitalized software.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2011 , but received cash of approximately $0.6 million as an adjustment to the purchase price of one of our 2010 acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S1	In 2010 , we completed seven acquisitions for $102.3 million , net of cash acquired.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S2	The majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of Realpoint, OBSR, Morningstar Denmark, and the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corp.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S3	In 2009, cash used for acquisitions, net of acquired cash, was $74.2 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S4	We completed six acquisitions in 2009 and increased our investment in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P248_S5	The majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of LIM and our acquisition of the equity research and data business of CPMS.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P249_S0	In 2011, we used cash of approximately $2.5 million to acquire a minority equity stake in YCharts, Inc., a technology company that provides stock research and analysis.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P249_S1	In 2009, we used cash of approximately $4.2 million to acquire minority equity stakes in Pitchbook Data and Bundle Corporation.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P250_S0	Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P250_S1	These cash inflows may be offset by dividend payments and cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P251_S0	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P251_S1	Similarly, the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P251_S2	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P252_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock-option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P252_S1	As a result, we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P252_S2	Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P253_S0	In 2011 , cash used for financing activities was $32.6 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P253_S1	We paid cash of approximately $40.7 million under our share repurchase program in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P253_S2	In addition, we made dividend payments of $10.0 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P253_S3	Partially offsetting these cash outflows were proceeds from stock-option exercises of $8.7 million and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units of $9.5 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P254_S0	In 2011 , we used cash of $32.6 million for financing activities compared with cash provided by financing activities of $12.5 million in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P254_S1	The net change of $45.1 million , was driven by an increase in cash used to repurchase common shares of $36.9 million and the dividends paid of $10.0 million in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P254_S2	An increase in excess tax benefits of $2.0 million , partially offset the cash outflow.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P255_S0	In 2010 , cash provided by financing activities was $12.5 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P255_S1	Proceeds from stock-option exercises totaled $9.2 million , while excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled $7.5 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P255_S2	Partially offsetting these inflows was $3.8 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P255_S3	In 2010 , cash provided by financing activities decreased by $12.8 million , driven by a decrease in proceeds from stock-option exercises, cash used to repurchase common shares, and (to a lesser extent) from a decline in excess tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P256_S0	In 2009, cash provided by financing activities was $25.3 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P256_S1	Proceeds from stock-option exercises totaled $16.4 million and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled $8.7 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P257_S0	Employees exercised approximately 0.7 million , 0.8 million , and 1.4 million stock options in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P257_S1	The total intrinsic value (the difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised during 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , was $29.9 million , $31.4 million , and $37.4 million , respectively.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P258_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P258_S1	We invested a total of $176.2 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P258_S2	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 6 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P259_S0	See N ote 17 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on events subsequent to December 31, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P260_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P260_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P261_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P262_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P262_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P262_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P262_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P262_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P263_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P264_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P264_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P264_S2	We also provide analysis, consulting, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P264_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P265_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P266_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P267_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P267_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P268_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P268_S1	Probability of collection is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P268_S2	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S1	As of December 31, 2011, our deferred revenue was $155.5 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S3	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S4	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P269_S5	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P270_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired several companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P270_S1	Over the past three years, the total cash paid for acquisitions, less cash acquired, was $176.2 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P270_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we have recorded $318.5 million of goodwill arising from acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P271_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we allocated $249.4 million of gross value to intangible assets, primarily for customer-related assets, technology-based assets, and intellectual property.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P271_S1	The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to 25 years.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P272_S0	Management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P272_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P272_S2	Once it has been determined that recognition of an asset or liability in a business combination is appropriate, the asset or liability generally is measured at fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P273_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P274_S0	The determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P275_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P275_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames, technology-related intangibles including internally developed software and databases, and non-compete agreements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P276_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P276_S1	These valuation approaches include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P277_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P277_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P277_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P277_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P278_S0	Assess the appropriate method for recording amortization expense over the intangible asset's useful life: We use judgment to determine the rate at which the amortization expense should be recognized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P278_S1	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P278_S2	If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method should be used.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P278_S3	Based on this guidance, we amortize intangible assets over their expected useful life using a straight-line amortization method.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P279_S0	We believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P280_S0	Goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 was $318.5 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P281_S0	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P281_S1	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P282_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P282_S1	In 2011, we altered the definition of our reporting units to align with the definition of our operating segments.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P282_S2	This realignment occurred because of our successful efforts to integrate acquired businesses and leverage proprietary content across multiple products.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P282_S3	As a result, the businesses that previously represented components of our operating segments no longer met the criteria for recognition as reporting units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P283_S0	Our reporting units constitute businesses for which discrete financial information, which is regularly reviewed by management, is available.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P283_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010, and 2009 and did not record any impairment losses in these years, reflecting our assessment that our estimates of fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P284_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P285_S0	In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P285_S1	These estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P286_S0	Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long-term horizon.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P286_S1	We update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P287_S0	We believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P287_S1	If actual results differ from our estimates, future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P287_S2	This would result in a non-cash charge, adversely affecting our results of operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P288_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 includes $68.2 million of property, equipment, and capitalized software, net of accumulated depreciation, and $139.8 million of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P289_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35 , Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we review our property, equipment, capitalized software, and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P289_S1	Such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P290_S0	If the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P291_S0	Estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P291_S1	They are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P291_S2	Changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment, which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P292_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P292_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P293_S0	Under FASB ASC 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation , stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P294_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P294_S1	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P294_S2	We ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P294_S3	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P295_S0	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P296_S0	Because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year, we adjust the stock-based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P296_S1	In addition, we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P297_S0	We believe that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P298_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P298_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P299_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P299_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_12_ITEM7_P299_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P299_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P299_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P300_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P300_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P301_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had gross deferred tax assets of $38.6 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $37.4 million .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P301_S1	The deferred tax assets include $13.3 million of deferred tax assets related to $50.1 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P302_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P302_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.3 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P303_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P303_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P303_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P303_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S0	We assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 , Income Taxes.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S1	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S2	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S3	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P304_S5	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P305_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P305_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P306_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P306_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P306_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P307_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P307_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P308_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations, which we describe in Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P308_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P308_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P308_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be impacted.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P309_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P309_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P309_S2	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2011-04 will be applied prospectively beginning on January 1, 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P309_S3	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2011-04 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P310_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P310_S1	The objective of this Update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P311_S0	An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P312_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P312_S1	For Morningstar, t he amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P313_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2011-08 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P314_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P314_S1	ASU No. 2011-12 defers the effective date of the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P314_S2	The deferral is temporary until the Board reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P314_S3	The Board has not yet established a timetable for its reconsideration.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P315_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_12_ITEM7_P316_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P317_S0	(2) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits) recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_12_ITEM7_P317_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statues of limitations are expected to lapse during 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM7_P317_S2	The table excludes $6.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We invest our investment portfolio mainly in high-quality fixed-income securities.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $470.2 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $0.8 million.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our European operations are subject to currency risk related to the euro.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_12_ITEM7A_P1_S4	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) as of December 31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest have been consolidated.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interests in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributed to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	In accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, we present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in two separate but consecutive statements, our Consolidated Statements of Income and separately, our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	We no longer present total comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statement of Equity.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	We state at fair value the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds, which are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of fixed-income securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P26_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs as described below:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 5 in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments , permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	FASB ASC 825 allows the fair value option to be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis when the asset or liability is initially recognized or when there's an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P34_S3	We do not apply this fair value option to any of our eligible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	Capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service yet are included in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their full fair values as of the date control is obtained, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S4	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P40_S5	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations on the acquisition date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and values applicable for income tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	In 2011, we altered the definition of our reporting units to align with the definition of our operating segments.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	This realignment occurred because of our successful efforts to integrate acquired businesses and leverage proprietary content across multiple products.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	As a result, the businesses that previously represented components of our operating segments no longer met the criteria for recognition as reporting units.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Our reporting units constitute businesses for which discrete financial information, which is regularly reviewed by management, is available.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010, and 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	We did not record any impairment losses in 2011, 2010, or 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement-Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	We recorded an impairment loss of approximately $800,000 in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S4	We did not record any impairment losses in 2010 or 2009.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P46_S5	The impairment charge is included in our amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Revenue Recognition : We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Effective January 1, 2011, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	ASU 2009-13 superseded EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue-generating activities, addresses how to separate deliverables, and specifies how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	We applied this guidance for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified from January 1, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not significantly affect either the timing or amount of our revenue recognition.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite for recognition of revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Licensed Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Equity Research, Premium Membership fees for Morningstar.com, our structured credit research and ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	For new-issue ratings and analysis for CMBS, we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance of the transaction.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Investment Consulting includes a broad range of services.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Pricing for the consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service required, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Our Retirement Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	For our Retirement Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P56_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	The revenue arrangements for Retirement Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements with our customers combine multiple products and services.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided, which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P64_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units and restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P65_S3	For stock options granted in 2011, we estimated the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P65_S4	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, in general, Morningstar's full-time employees are eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P67_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements, and also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding primarily reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Beginning in 2010, we further compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	In May 2010, we issued restricted stock in conjunction with the acquisition of Realpoint, LLC (now Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC).
1289419_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Because the restricted stock contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends, it meets the criteria of a participating security.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	Our segment accounting policies are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	We exclude these items from our operating segment results to provide our chief operating decision maker with a better indication of each segment s ability to generate cash flow.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S2	This information is one of the criteria used by our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources to each segment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S3	We include capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions in the Corporate Items category.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S4	Our segment disclosures are consistent with the business segment information provided to our chief operating decision maker on a recurring basis; for that reason, we don t present balance sheet information by segment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P90_S5	We disclose goodwill by segment in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 350-20-50, Intangibles - Goodwill - Disclosure.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following tables present information about our operating segments:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	Information by geographical region is as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	We classify our investments in three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	We monitor the concentration, diversification, maturity, and liquidity of our investment portfolio, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities, and classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , held-to-maturity investments include a $1,600,000 certificate of deposit held as collateral against two bank guarantees for our office lease in Australia.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	The realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized loss on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	The fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements and the necessary disclosures are as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P103_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P103_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting these investment categories each in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Aegis Equities Research, a provider of independent equity research in Australia, for $10,269,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 1, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P106_S2	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	The allocation includes $5,801,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	Goodwill of $5,117,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefits of creating a larger analyst team that will enable us to expand our coverage of Australian-listed companies, provide Australian clients with more robust independent research, and give us the potential to expand our services in multiple delivery channels.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P108_S2	Approximately $1,787,000 of the intangible assets is deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately three years from the acquisition date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR) for $17,937,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	OBSR is a provider of fund research, ratings, and investment consulting services in the United Kingdom and offers an array of customized consulting services including model portfolios, advice on fund construction, and corporate governance services that are used by many of the leading financial advisers and fund platforms.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 12, 2010.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	The allocation includes $9,266,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	Goodwill of $12,422,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefit of adding to our existing fund research team in London and continuing to build our thought leadership in investment research.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	OBSR will also help us expand our investment consulting presence in the United Kingdom, where we already provide asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction services to institutions and intermediaries.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	The deferred tax liability of $2,317,000 is primarily because the amortization expense related to intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	In May 2010, we acquired Realpoint, LLC (Realpoint), a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Realpoint offers securities ratings, research, surveillance services, and data to help institutional investors identify credit risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	Institutional investment firms subscribe to Realpoint's ratings and analytics, including money managers who invest in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P114_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 3, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P114_S4	In 2011, we renamed Realpoint as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	In conjunction with this acquisition, we paid $38,327,000 in cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements and in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations , we account for these grants as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	See Note 10 for additional information concerning the accounting for this restricted stock.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	The allocation includes $19,120,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	Goodwill of $24,903,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity for Morningstar to enter the structured finance ratings and analysis business.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The value assigned to goodwill, intangible assets, and restricted stock at the date of grant are deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	In July 2010, we acquired an additional 75% interest in Morningstar Danmark A/S (Morningstar Denmark), increasing our ownership to 100% from 25% .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	Morningstar Denmark's main offering is the investment information website for individual investors, Morningstar.dk, which provides fund and ETF data, portfolio tools, and market analysis.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P121_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on July 1, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	Morningstar Denmark's total estimated fair value of $20,192,000 includes $15,467,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 75% interest in Morningstar Denmark and $4,725,000 related to the 25% of Morningstar Denmark we previously held.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P122_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 25% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest and recorded a non-cash holding gain of $4,564,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P122_S2	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	The allocation includes $9,854,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $2,504,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	Goodwill of $12,342,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	We increased the liability related to this vacant office space because we anticipated receiving lower sublease income and expected it would take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P190_S1	As of that date we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).

1289419_12_ITEM8_P192_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P192_S3	Any shares subject to awards under the 2011 Plan, but not under the 2004 Plan, that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.

1289419_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2011 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	Because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter, we adjust the stock-based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P196_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P196_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P196_S3	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	In conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition in May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements prepared in conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition, we account for the grant of restricted shares as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	See Note 6, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information concerning the Realpoint acquisition.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	We measured the fair value of the restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P201_S1	We amortize the fair value of $9,363,000 to stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P201_S2	The stock-based compensation expense recorded in the 2011 includes approximately $396,000 of expense recognized upon the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P201_S3	We have assumed that all of the remaining restricted stock will ultimately vest, and therefore we have not incorporated a forfeiture rate for purposes of determining the stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P202_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	Almost all of the options granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan have a premium feature in which the exercise price increases over the term of the option at a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield as of the date of grant.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P203_S1	Options granted under the 2011 Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P204_S3	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2011 :
1289419_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P208_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $59.45 on that date.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return that exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Statement of Income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P209_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	In 2009, we determined that certain incentive stock options (ISOs) granted to three executives, including Tao Huang, our former chief operating officer, should have been treated as non-qualified stock options for the executives' and our income tax purposes.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P210_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an operating expense of $4,887,000 related to adjusting the tax treatment of these stock options that were originally considered ISOs.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P210_S2	In the first quarter of 2010, we paid these individuals $4,887,000 to compensate for the difference in tax treatment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P211_S1	In 2011 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P211_S2	In 2010, we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P211_S3	In 2009, we suspended matching contributions to our 401(k) program in the United States.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	The following table presents the components of our net non-operating income:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	Interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P214_S1	Interest expense in 2011 of $1,318,000 includes approximately $900,000 related to the $1,400,000 of business tax expense for prior years recorded in the second quarter of 2011, as discussed above in the section, Consolidated Results .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	Other income (expense), net primarily represents foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to non-U.S. operations.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P215_S1	It also includes realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P215_S2	In 2010, this category also includes the holding gain of $4,564,000 resulting from the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark; in 2009, it includes the holding gain of $352,000 resulting from the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Korea.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P215_S3	See Note 6 for additional information concerning Morningstar Denmark and Morningstar Korea.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P220_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	Our U.S. federal NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2011 of $2,587,000 is subject to limitations on the use of the NOL imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and therefore is limited to approximately $225,000 per year.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	The increase in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflects additional NOL carryforwards in our non-U.S. operations as well as the impact of currency translations.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P226_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $66,000,000 as of December 31, 2011 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P226_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P227_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P227_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.3 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P228_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P228_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P228_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2007 to the present.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P228_S3	In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally extends to years prior to 2005.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P229_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P229_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P230_S0	It is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P231_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $5,329,000 and a non-current liability of $6,200,000 for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P231_S1	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P232_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P233_S0	In 2011 , we recorded a net increase of $3,100,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $4,426,000 increased our income tax expense by $3,956,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P233_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $1,325,000 for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $1,001,000 decreased our income tax expense by $1,001,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P234_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , we had $12,189,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $11,907,000 , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $9,827,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P235_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P235_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_12_ITEM8_P236_S0	We recorded the increase in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2011 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P237_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_12_ITEM8_P237_S1	The claims against Morningstar relate to a 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P238_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P239_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P239_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P239_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P239_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P240_S0	Morningstar is aware of 13 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P240_S1	As part of that investigation, Morningstar has been responding to discovery requests and has had discussions with the Receiver.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P240_S2	The Receiver has not filed a case against Morningstar, and Morningstar does not know whether a case will be filed.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P240_S3	The separate Klass Matter was filed in September 2011 against LG, Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, in which plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P240_S4	Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P241_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P241_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the action.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P241_S2	Morningstar believes the allegations against it have no legal or factual basis and plans to re-file its motion to dismiss the case once the stay is lifted.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P242_S0	While Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P243_S0	In November 2010, InvestPic, LLC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Morningstar, Inc. and several other companies alleging that each defendant infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,349,291, which relates to methods for performing statistical analysis on investment data and displaying the analyzed data in graphical form.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P243_S1	InvestPic seeks, among other things, unspecified damages because of defendants' alleged infringing activities and costs.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P243_S2	While Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claims asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P244_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC) and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Morningstar Credit Ratings for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P244_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P244_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones's request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar's corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P244_S3	Morningstar Credit Ratings and Morningstar continue to vigorously contest liability on all of Egan-Jones' claims for damages.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P244_S4	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P245_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P245_S1	Business Logic is alleging that Ibbotson Associates and Morningstar violated Business Logic's rights by using its trade secrets to develop a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P245_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P245_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P246_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson Associates are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P247_S0	In December 2004, Morningstar Associates, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc., received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General's office seeking information and documents related to an investigation the New York Attorney General's office is conducting.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P247_S1	The subpoena asked for documents relating to the investment consulting services the company offers to retirement plan providers, including fund lineup recommendations for retirement plan sponsors.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P247_S2	Morningstar Associates has provided the requested information and documents.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P248_S0	In 2005, Morningstar Associates received subpoenas seeking information and documents related to investigations being conducted by the SEC and United States Department of Labor.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P248_S1	The subpoenas were similar in scope to the New York Attorney General subpoena.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P249_S0	In January 2007 and September 2009, respectively, the SEC and Department of Labor each notified Morningstar Associates that it had ended its investigation, with no enforcement action, fines, or penalties.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P250_S0	In January 2007, Morningstar Associates received a Notice of Proposed Litigation from the New York Attorney General's office.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P250_S1	The Notice centers on disclosure relating to an optional service offered to retirement plan sponsors (employers) that select 401(k) plan services from ING, one of Morningstar Associates' clients.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P250_S2	The Notice gave Morningstar Associates the opportunity to explain why the New York Attorney General's office should not institute proceedings.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P250_S3	Morningstar Associates promptly submitted its explanation and has cooperated fully with the New York Attorney General's office.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P251_S0	We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of this matter, which may include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our stock price, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P251_S1	We also cannot predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P252_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with the matters described above because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P253_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P253_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P254_S0	On December 9, 2011 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on January 31, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 13, 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P254_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , we recorded a liability for dividends payable of $5,009,000 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P255_S0	In September 2010, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $100 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P255_S1	In December 2011, the board approved an increase to the $100 million share repurchase program it announced in 2010.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P255_S2	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P255_S3	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P255_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , we had repurchased a total of 798,337 shares for $44,456,000 under this authorization.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P256_S0	In January 2012 , we acquired a minority equity stake in HelloWallet LLC (HelloWallet) for approximately $6.7 million .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P256_S1	HelloWallet is a provider of personalized financial guidance to employees of Fortune 1000 companies.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P256_S2	Our ownership interest in HelloWallet is approximately 15% .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P256_S3	We plan to account for this investment using the cost method.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P257_S0	In February 2012 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P257_S1	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2012 to shareholders of record as of April 13, 2012 .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P258_S0	On February 17, 2012, a large Investment Consulting client notified us that it will be moving to in-house management of several fund of funds portfolios in April 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P258_S1	We received about $12.4 million in revenue from our work on these portfolios in 2011, which represented 2% of our consolidated revenue and a larger percentage of our consolidated operating income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P259_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P259_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P259_S2	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2011-04 will be applied prospectively beginning on January 1, 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P259_S3	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2011-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P260_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P260_S1	The objective of this Update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P261_S0	An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P262_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50% .
1289419_12_ITEM8_P262_S1	For Morningstar, t he amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in 2012.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P263_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2011-08 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P264_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P264_S1	ASU No. 2011-12 defers the effective date of the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P264_S2	The deferral is temporary until the Board reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users.
1289419_12_ITEM8_P264_S3	The Board has not yet established a timetable for its reconsideration.
1289419_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
1289419_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	We also provide asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants through our Investment Management segment.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	In addition to our U.S.-based products and services, we offer local versions of our products designed for investors in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Morningstar serves approximately 8.9 million individual investors, 260,000 financial advisors, and 5,100 institutional clients.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We maintain a series of comprehensive databases on many types of investments, focusing on investment vehicles that are widely used by investors globally.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	After building these databases, we add value and insight to the data by applying our core skills of research, technology, and design.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we provided extensive data on approximately 416,000 investments, including:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	real-time price quotes for global foreign currencies.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business model is based on leveraging our investments in these databases by selling a wide variety of products and services to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions around the world.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our data and proprietary analytical tools such as the Morningstar Rating for mutual funds, which rates past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, and the Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund's underlying investment style, have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	We've created other tools, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Market Barometer, which allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our popular Portfolio X-Ray tool helps investors reduce risk and understand the key characteristics of their portfolios based on nine different factors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Since 1998, we've expanded our research efforts on individual stocks and have worked to popularize the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett; and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We offer a variety of qualitative measures such as Stewardship Grades, which help investors identify companies and fund firms that have demonstrated a high level of commitment to shareholders and stewardship of investors' capital.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	We introduced a new global Stewardship Rating for stocks in 2012 that places more emphasis on management decisions that directly improve returns on invested capital and shareholder investment.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2011, we introduced our forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Rating for funds, a global, qualitative measure based on our analyst research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	We also offer qualitative research and ratings on alternative funds, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, 529 plans, target-date funds, and stocks.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 2009, we began publishing credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We currently provide ratings on about 700 issuers and also provide research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	We began publishing analyst research on municipal bonds in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our fundamental municipal research is designed to assess relative credit quality and fiscal distress using a proprietary, analyst-driven methodology.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We've also developed in-depth advice on security selection and portfolio construction to meet the needs of investors and professionals looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe many investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our strategy is to leverage our unique core capabilities and focus on the customer segments where we have the greatest opportunities to deliver value.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	For investors and professionals who make their own decisions, Morningstar has the transparent, credible analytical frameworks, powered by Morningstar research, high-quality data, and data visualization that lead to better decisions and better outcomes for investors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	For investors and professionals who prefer to outsource the decision-making, Morningstar offers a seasoned team of investment professionals with expertise in asset allocation, manager research, due diligence, and portfolio construction, underpinned by award-winning, independent methodologies and analytical constructs that help clients expand their customer base and mitigate risk.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In 2012, we streamlined and clarified our growth strategies.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Instead of five strategic objectives, we're now focusing on three.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	We no longer separately break out two objectives we formerly identified--create a premier global investment database and expand internationally--because they underpin everything we do, and we now consider them part of our other three objectives.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Develop the next-generation software for our investment research platforms, which will offer the most elegant and intuitive user experience for our customers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe that individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients increasingly want integrated solutions as opposed to using different research tools for different parts of their portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	To help meet this need, our strategy has been to focus our product offerings on our three major platforms:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	These products all include integrated research and portfolio tools, allowing investors to use our proprietary information and analysis across multiple security types.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	With each platform, we believe we can continue to expand our reach with our current audiences, as well as extending our reach to new market segments.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	We're now building the next-generation software architecture that will eventually underlie all of our investment research platforms.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The new software architecture uses an "app-based" design and takes our software to a much higher design standard that's more intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	It also has several technological advantages, including a more streamlined design and development process for commonly used Morningstar capabilities such as portfolio management tools, faster speed to market with new capabilities, and a more consistent user experience across Morningstar's platforms.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our next-generation software works with the touch interfaces commonly used in mobile devices and will eventually eliminate the need for desktop installations, making it easier for our customers to access our software from any device with an Internet connection.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We're also significantly improving our charting and graphing capabilities, as well as more deeply integrating charts and graphics with editorial content to provide a new level of context and understanding.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We plan to introduce this new architecture as part of Morningstar Direct in 2013, beginning with new modules for mutual funds, stocks, and real-time market data.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Over time, we'd like all of our software solutions to use this single technology architecture.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	By moving all of our core research products to a common software architecture, we'll be able to leverage our development resources, give our customers a more unified and consistent Morningstar experience, and better showcase our innovative research and analytical tools.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Deliver the most effective investment data, research, and ratings to help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our goal is to continue producing investment insights that empower investors and focus our research efforts in three major areas:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Extend leadership position in global fund research .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Over the past several years, we have expanded our analyst coverage in fund markets outside of the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	We've built an integrated team of locally based fund experts to expand our research coverage in additional markets around the world.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 110 fund analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	We currently produce qualitative analyst research and Morningstar Analyst Ratings on more than 3,400 funds around the world.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	We plan to continue expanding the number of funds that have Morningstar Analyst Ratings and in-depth qualitative research reports.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Continue leveraging our capabilities in stocks.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our equity research complements our approach to mutual fund analysis, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund's portfolio.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we provided analyst research on approximately 1,700 companies globally.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We're committed to maintaining the broad, high-quality coverage we've become known for as one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We're working to expand distribution of our equity research through a variety of channels, including financial advisors, institutional investment firms, and companies outside of the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	We believe that investors' increasing awareness of the value of independent research will strengthen our business over the long term.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	We've also expanded our proprietary stock database, which we view as an important complement to our analyst research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Build business in credit research and ratings.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	We began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers in December 2009 and currently produce research and ratings on about 700 corporate credit issuers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	In 2012, we began publishing research on more than 100 municipal bond issuers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	We view credit ratings as a natural extension of the equity research we've been producing for the past decade.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P25_S4	We believe we have a unique viewpoint to offer on company default risk that leverages our cash-flow modeling expertise, proprietary measures like economic moat, and in-depth knowledge of the companies and industries we cover.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We're including this research on our software platforms to provide investors with an additional perspective on fixed-income investments.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We also plan to monetize the ratings through enterprise licenses and subscriptions to our institutional equity research clients, who have access to the forecasts, models, and scores underlying the ratings.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also expanded our fixed-income capabilities with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint, LLC, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC that specializes in research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe investors are looking for better research on these securities and that we're well-positioned to meet this need.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	B e a world-class investment management organization based on our proprietary research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe assembling and evaluating multimanager portfolios is a natural extension of our expertise in understanding managed investment products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our investment advisory programs combine managed investment vehicles typically mutual funds in portfolios designed to help investors meet their financial goals.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	When we create portfolios made up of other funds, our goal is to simplify the investment process and help investors access portfolios that match their level of risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term investment objectives.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	We draw on our extensive experience analyzing funds and combine quantitative research with a qualitative assessment of manager skill and investment style.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	We had a total of $94.3 billion in assets under advisement in our Investment Advisory business as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our advisory business focuses on relationships and agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager or asset allocation program designer for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis-point fee.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We plan to continue building this business by expanding to reach new markets outside of the United States, expanding our capabilities in areas such as alternative investment strategies, developing more ways to incorporate risk protection and insurance, expanding to reach additional client segments, and focusing on performance and client support.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We also offer managed retirement account services through our Retirement Solutions platform and had $25.1 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We offer these services for retirement plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to our managed account programs, which are quantitative systems that select investment options and make retirement planning choices for the participants.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe retirement plan participants will continue to adopt managed accounts because of the complexity involved in retirement planning.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios is a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had $4.7 billion in assets under management invested with Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Given the core capabilities discussed above, we're focusing on four primary client segments:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Advisor (including independent financial advisors as well as those affiliated with broker-dealers, other intermediaries, and wealth managers); Asset management (including fund companies, insurance companies, and other companies that build and manage portfolios of securities for their clients); Retirement (including retirement plan providers and plan sponsors); and Individual investors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Since our founding in 1984, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	From 2006 through 2010, we also completed 24 acquisitions to support our growth objectives (as detailed above).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	While we may make additional acquisitions to support these objectives, our primary focus now is on integrating previous acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	We did not make any acquisitions in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	As part of our efforts to simplify and streamline our operations to focus on our core offerings, we divested several small business lines in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	For information about the acquisitions we made in 2010, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	For information about the divestitures we made in 2012, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	We operate our business in two segments:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Investment Information, which includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Investment Management, which includes all of our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The table below shows our revenue by business segment for each of the past three years:
1289419_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	For information on segment operating income (loss) refer to Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Morningstar Data (formerly Licensed Data), a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases, including real-time pricing and commodity data; Morningstar Advisor Workstation, a web-based investment planning system for independent financial advisors as well as advisors affiliated with larger firms; Morningstar Direct, a web-based institutional research platform; Morningstar.com, which includes both Premium Memberships and Internet advertising sales; and Integrated Web Tools, a set of online tools and components that help institutional clients build customized websites or enhance their existing sites.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Other major products within the Investment Information segment include Principia, our CD-ROM-based software for independent financial advisors; and Morningstar Structured Credit Ratings and Research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We also offer a variety of financial communications materials, print and online publications, investment indexes, and other investment software products for financial advisors and institutions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	In 2012 , 31.9% of Investment Information segment revenue was from outside of the United States, compared with 32.8% in 2011 and 31.8% in 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Most of our products for individual investors are designed for investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing and investors who seek out third-party sources to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial planners.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	We sell our advisor-related products both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing enterprise to use our products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our institutional clients include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan sponsors and providers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We also have data reselling agreements with third-party providers of investment tools and applications, allowing us to increase the distribution of our data with minimal additional cost.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe the Investment Information segment has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	We've historically had higher revenue in the second quarter because we hold our largest annual investment conference during the quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	Other products in this segment generally have not shown marked seasonality.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our largest customer in the Investment Information segment made up approximately 2% of segment revenue in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Morningstar Data gives institutions access to a full range of investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data and commodity data.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	We also introduced new data feeds and enhanced our Document Library solution to support new compliance requirements for retirement plan providers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	We introduced Morningstar Markets Commodities Edition, which allows traders and risk managers to access our expansive historical energy data library and real-time exchange data on one integrated web-based platform.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	The new platform allows traders to get a truly holistic view of the energy markets and can be accessed on any device with an Internet connection, including smartphones and tablets.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We made numerous enhancements to our real-time markets data in 2012, adding new exchanges and security types as well as tools and services for active traders.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We've also been working to integrate our market data and capabilities in Morningstar's other platforms, including Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, retail investor websites in Europe, Integrated Web Tools, and other products.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Windows 8 users are able to access a variety of Morningstar stock data, from top-line general measures like market capitalization, trading volume, price range, and competitors; to more granular data such as debt-to-equity ratio, forward price-to-earnings ratio, and return on assets.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	Investors can also pull up detailed charts showing revenue, profit, and cash reserve statistics, as well as a table showing the most-active mutual funds trading in each security.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Pricing for Morningstar Data is based on the number of funds, market indexes, stocks, commodities, or other securities covered; the amount and depth of information provided for each security; and the number of users and level of distribution.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	With Morningstar Markets, we charge additional fees for individual components or customization.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	For Morningstar Data, our primary competitors are Bloomberg, eVestment Alliance, Interactive Data Corporation, Index Universe, Mergent, PSN/Informa, Standard Poor's, and Thomson Reuters.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Morningstar Advisor Workstation, a web-based investment planning system, provides financial advisors with a comprehensive set of tools for conducting their core business including investment research, planning, and presentations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	It allows advisors to build and maintain a client portfolio database that can be fully integrated with the firm's back-office technology and resources.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	Moreover, it helps advisors create customized reports for client portfolios that combine mutual funds, stocks, separate accounts, variable annuity/life subaccounts, ETFs, hedge funds, closed-end funds, 529 plans, offshore funds, and pension and life funds.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , 162,904 advisors in the United States were licensed to use Advisor Workstation, which is available in two versions: Morningstar Office for independent financial advisors and an enterprise version for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	The enterprise version includes four core modules: Clients Portfolios, Research, Sales/Hypotheticals, and Planning.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	We also offer a variety of other applications, including tools for defined contribution plans; Morningstar Document Library, which helps firms comply with pre- and post-sale document delivery requirements by providing access to prospectuses and supplements in HTML or PDF formats; Analyst Research Center, which complements the quantitative data in Advisor Workstation with independent, qualitative research on stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and initial public offerings; and Presentation Library, which gives advisors access to compelling client presentation materials.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	These applications can be purchased as stand-alone products or combined as part of a full Workstation license.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P136_S2	The management fee is based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client's average daily portfolio balance.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P141_S0	To enable these companies to do business in their designated territories, we provide them with the rights to the Morningstar name and logo and with access to certain of our products and technology.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P141_S1	Each company is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its country and working with Morningstar's data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases, develop new products, and enhance existing products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P142_S0	See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our business operations outside of the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P143_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P143_S1	We try to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P143_S2	For example, in the normal course of business, we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P143_S3	We use these agreements to define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P144_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we maintain operating companies.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P144_S1	As we move into new countries, we consider adding to these registrations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P144_S2	In some jurisdictions, we also register certain product identifiers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P144_S3	We have registered our name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in various other countries.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P145_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are registered marks of Morningstar in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P146_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States and Canada.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P146_S1	We believe these patents represent our commitment to developing innovative products and tools for investors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P147_S0	In the majority of our licensing agreements, we license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P147_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P148_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with all of our operating companies.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P148_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to develop and market similar products under our name in their operating territories.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P149_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and obtaining it directly from public filings.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P150_S0	We believe our business has a modest amount of seasonality.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P150_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as the Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook and our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P150_S2	Most of our products are sold with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P150_S3	This tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P151_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P151_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P152_S0	In 2012 , our largest customer accounted for less than 3% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P153_S0	The economic and financial information industry has been marked by increased consolidation over the past several years, with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P153_S1	Some of our major competitors include Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P153_S2	These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P153_S3	We also have a number of smaller competitors in our two business segments, which we discuss in Business Segments, Products, and Services above.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P154_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment analysis and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P155_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P155_S1	We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P155_S2	We have a flexible technology platform that allows our products to work together across a full range of investment databases, delivery formats, and market segments.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P155_S3	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P155_S4	This allows us to control our development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P156_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our technology team consisted of approximately 900 programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P157_S0	In 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 our development expense represented 7.8% , 8.4% , and 8.9% , respectively, of our revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P157_S1	We expect that development expense will continue to represent a meaningful percentage of our revenue in the future.

1289419_13_ITEM1_P197_S3	He holds a bachelor's degree in industrial design from The Ohio State University and a master's degree in fine arts from the Yale University School of Art.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P198_S0	We were incorporated in Illinois on May 16, 1984.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P198_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P199_S0	We maintain a website at http://corporate.morningstar.com .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P199_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P199_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P199_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P199_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P200_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P200_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P200_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P201_S0	Our investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P202_S0	Three of our subsidiaries, Ibbotson Associates, Inc., Morningstar Associates, LLC, and Morningstar Investment Services, Inc. are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P202_S1	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P202_S2	Such requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P203_S0	As registered investment advisors, all three subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P204_S0	In addition, because these three subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P204_S1	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P204_S2	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P205_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P206_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P206_S1	We may not be able to prevent clients from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P206_S2	Because we provided investment advisory and management services on about $ 149.5 billion in assets as of December 31, 2012 , we could face substantial liabilities if we breach our fiduciary duties.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P207_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P208_S0	An outage of our database and network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, much of which is geographically concentrated in our Chicago headquarters and other backup locations in the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S4	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S5	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S6	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures or disruptions, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P209_S7	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P210_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P210_S1	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P210_S2	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P211_S0	Our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P211_S1	Any failures or disruptions could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P212_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P212_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P212_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P213_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about our users.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S0	Customers routinely input personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S1	We also handle an increasing volume of personally sensitive information through our Portfolio Management Service, Enterprise Data Management, managed retirement accounts, and other areas of our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S2	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S3	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S4	We may suffer malicious attacks seeking to penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P214_S5	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, portfolio holdings, or credit card information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P215_S0	Changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations, compliance failures, or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P216_S0	Our investment advisory operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P216_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P216_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are primarily subject to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P216_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P216_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P217_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P217_S1	We began publishing credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers in 2009.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P218_S0	Although our corporate credit rating business is not currently regulated as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P218_S1	We cannot predict the future impact of potential future regulatory changes on our corporate credit rating business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P219_S0	We also expanded our credit rating business operations with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC), an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P220_S0	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P221_S0	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examinations by the SEC.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P222_S0	It is difficult to predict the future effect of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P222_S1	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P222_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory or credit rating services in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P223_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may adversely impact our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S0	We believe ongoing economic weakness continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on consumer discretionary spending.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S1	The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as well as more recent financial and economic uncertainty, has led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies, which make up a large percentage of our client base.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S2	Some institutional clients also implemented additional review processes for new contracts or began to provide certain services, particularly investment advisory services, in-house rather than hiring external service providers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S4	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market during 2011 and 2012, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P224_S5	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P225_S0	In 2010 and 2011, rising government debt levels around the world as well as downgrades in sovereign debt issues for some European countries led to market fears about a potential crisis in global sovereign debt.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P225_S1	Some European countries have been unable to successfully refinance their debts, leading European finance officials to take measures during 2010 and 2011 to stabilize financial conditions across Europe.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P226_S0	Although sovereign debt problems have been most severe in countries such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, concerns have also grown about the stability of Europe as a whole and the future of the euro currency.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P227_S0	In 2012 , approximately 16.2% of our consolidated revenue was from Europe, including 7.6% in Continental Europe and 8.6% in the United Kingdom.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P227_S1	Our European operations are also subject to currency risk related to the euro, which accounted for approximately 5.8% of our consolidated revenue in 2012 and approximately 10.2% of our cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P227_S2	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P227_S3	Our reported revenue could suffer if the euro declines relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P228_S0	In addition, if financial markets around the world experience negative performance and volatility, demand for our products and services may decline, and our revenue, operating income, and other financial results could suffer.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P228_S1	Our business results may also be impacted by negative trends in Internet advertising sales.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P228_S2	The financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, that are beyond our control.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P229_S0	Our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines as well as the effect of cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P230_S0	In 2012 , revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P230_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P230_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P230_S3	The size of these portfolios can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P230_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P231_S0	We could face liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of some of our currently pending litigation.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P232_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P232_S1	These include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical in the asset management and financial information businesses in which we operate.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P233_S0	We are currently defendants in a number of litigation matters as further described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P233_S1	In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts of damages.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P234_S0	Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of any particular proceeding can never be predicted with certainty.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P234_S1	An adverse outcome in a litigation matter could, depending on the facts, have a material financial impact on our company.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P235_S0	In addition to its potential financial impact, litigation can have a significant adverse reputational impact.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P235_S1	We depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P235_S2	Allegations of improper conduct made by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P236_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P237_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is generated from products and services related to mutual funds.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P238_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P238_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P238_S2	Based on Morningstar's estimates for U.S. mutual fund asset flows, long-term open-end funds had positive net inflows of approximately $243 billion in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P238_S3	However, assets continued to flow out of actively managed stock funds, with investors heavily favoring fixed-income funds and passively managed vehicles.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P238_S4	While equity funds had net outflows of approximately $104 billion in 2012, fixed-income funds experienced net inflows of more than $300 billion.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P239_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P239_S1	In addition, Morningstar is best known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P240_S0	Over the past several years, passively managed index funds have seen strong investor interest.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P240_S1	This trend continued in 2012, as passively managed vehicles (both mutual funds and ETFs) had nearly $200 billion in net inflows, compared with $7 billion of net outflows for active products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P240_S2	Overall, we estimate that passively managed assets now account for about one-fourth of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P241_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P241_S1	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P242_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 29 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S1	We believe these proprietary tools continue to provide us with a competitive advantage, but if tools similar to them become more broadly available through other channels, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S2	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S3	Because of lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms, we believe the barriers to entry for new competitors have declined, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S4	Smaller companies may also be able to introduce new research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P243_S5	We cannot guarantee that we will continue to successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P244_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally impacting the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S2	Examples include the shift from local network to computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S3	While some of these changes may offer business opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet the rapidly changing technology landscape.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S4	We believe our history of rapid technological innovation and expertise in technology have historically given us a competitive advantage.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S5	As mentioned above, though, we believe that lower technology costs and growth in open software platforms have lowered barriers to entry for new competitors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P245_S6	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P246_S0	Competition could reduce our share of the investment research market and hurt our financial performance.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P247_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment research providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P247_S1	We compete with many different types of companies that vary in size, product scope, and media focus, including large and well-established distributors of financial information, such as Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies; and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P247_S2	We compete with a variety of other companies in different areas of our business, which we discuss in greater detail in the Business Segments, Products, and Services section in Item 1-Business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P248_S0	Many of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P248_S1	This may allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for products and services, devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services, and make more attractive offers to potential clients, subscribers, and strategic partners.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P248_S2	Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P248_S3	Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P249_S0	The investment information industry is dominated by a few large players, and industry consolidation has increased in the past several years.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P249_S1	If providers of data and investment analysis continue to consolidate, our competitive position may suffer.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P250_S0	Our operations outside of the United States are expanding and involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P251_S0	Our operations outside of the United States have expanded to $191.3 million in revenue in 2012 from $184.9 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM1_P252_S0	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P252_S1	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P253_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P253_S1	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P253_S2	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P253_S3	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, our financial results are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P254_S0	The increasing concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative impact on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P255_S0	We now have approximately 900 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fourth of our total workforce.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P256_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, we cannot predict the level of political and regulatory risk that may affect our operations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P256_S1	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P256_S2	Any difficulties that we face in successfully maintaining our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide, particularly because of our increasing reliance on this facility.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P257_S0	We have approximately 360 employees who work at our data collection facility in Mumbai, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_13_ITEM1_P257_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P258_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P259_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on corporate credit issuers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P259_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P259_S2	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P260_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P260_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P260_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P260_S3	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P261_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P262_S0	We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P262_S1	These organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P262_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P263_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P263_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P263_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P263_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P263_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P264_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P265_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P265_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P265_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers, or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P265_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P266_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P266_S1	It is possible that our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P266_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P266_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P267_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P267_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S0	We believe that independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S1	We offer products and services to our institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S2	Our institutional clients have generated a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue in recent years.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S3	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S4	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P268_S5	The fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services, as well as the fact that in some cases we make investment recommendations within the framework of client constraints, may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P269_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P269_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P270_S0	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us (either intentionally or inadvertently) could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P271_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P272_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P273_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 53% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P273_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P273_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P273_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P274_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S2	A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs, office leases, and other infrastructure spending, which generally cannot be adjusted quickly.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S3	Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S4	If actual revenue falls below our expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S5	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S6	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P275_S7	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P276_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P277_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P277_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P277_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P277_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P277_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P278_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P279_S0	In the past, we've granted options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P279_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P279_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 674,479 shares of common stock, 620,379 of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $22.66 per share.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P279_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , there were 745,927 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 33 months.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P280_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P280_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and shares are issued when restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P280_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P281_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P281_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P282_S0	Stock option exercises, share repurchases, and other factors may create volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P283_S0	Part of our cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P283_S1	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised if the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise) exceeds the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P283_S2	Similarly, excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock at vesting is greater than the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P283_S3	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P284_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be realized.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P284_S1	Because of this uncertainty, there may be additional volatility in our cash flows from financing activities.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P285_S0	In addition, our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock, of which $188.5 million remains available for future repurchases as of February 22, 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P285_S1	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that management deems appropriate.
1289419_13_ITEM1_P285_S2	Changes in the amount of repurchase activity from period to period may also cause volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_13_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we leased approximately 305,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our office located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 351,000 square feet of office space in 24 other countries around the world, including 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	Morningstar is aware of 14 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	In November 2011, Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the Klass Matter.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P5_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P5_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the Klass Matter.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P6_S0	In April 2012, the Receiver filed a complaint against Morningstar, in which the Receiver claims that Morningstar is liable for contribution and aiding and abetting Stinson's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P6_S1	The same day the Receiver filed his complaint, Morningstar sought leave from the court to file a counter suit against Stinson and two of his entities-Keystone State Capital Corporation and LG-for, among other things, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of user agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P6_S2	In June 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion for leave to file suit.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P6_S3	The court took no position on the merits of Morningstar's claims, and did not preclude Morningstar from renewing its motion to file a complaint at a later time, but deferred to the Receiver's request not to subject the receivership estate to additional litigation at this early point in the receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P6_S4	In August 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion to dismiss the Receiver's complaint.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P7_S0	Morningstar believes the allegations against it by the Klass plaintiffs and the Receiver have no legal or factual basis and plans to vigorously contest the claims.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P7_S1	Morningstar also intends to refile its affirmative claims against Stinson, Keystone, and LG at a later time consistent with the court's order.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P8_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P9_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P9_S1	Business Logic is alleging breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation in connection with Ibbotson's development of a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P9_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P9_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P10_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P11_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with the matters described above because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P12_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC) and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Morningstar Credit Ratings for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P12_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P12_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones's request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar's corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P12_S3	In December 2012, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar, and Egan Jones entered into a settlement agreement resolving the litigation.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P13_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_13_ITEM3_P13_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN .
1289419_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 22, 2013, the last reported price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $68.90 per share, and there were 1,479 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	In September 2010, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The first dividend was paid on January 14, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P3_S2	We paid a dividend during each quarter of 2011 and 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P3_S3	On December 7, 2012 , our board of directors declared a dividend of 12.5 cents per share, payable on December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of December 17, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM5_P3_S4	This was our fifth dividend payment in 2012 because we opted to pay the dividend in December instead of in January 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table shows the dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	See Note 12 in our Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2012 and during the three months ended December 31, 2012:
1289419_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	_________________________________________________ * Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) In September 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of the outstanding common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P9_S1	In December 2011, the board approved an increase to this program.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P9_S2	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P9_S3	In December 2012, the board approved another increase to this program.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P9_S4	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock with a revised expiration date of December 31, 2014.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_13_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 1, 2013:
1289419_13_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013, the previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plans for Chris Boruff, Scott Cooley, Bevin Desmond and her spouse, Cheryl Francis, Steve Kaplan, Cathy Odelbo, Don Phillips, Richard Robbins, and Paul Sturm completed or expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares each identified director and executive officer will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans identified above.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2012, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2013 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM5_P12_S3	Each director and executive officer identified in the table may amend or terminate his or her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Other Consolidated Financial Data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as restated, that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	We began granting restricted stock units in May 2006 and have made additional grants each year since then.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	Beginning in 2010, we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of Realpoint, LLC.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P3_S3	The expense in 2012 and 2011 includes $3.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for accelerated vesting of a portion of this restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	We did not grant any stock options in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	In 2011, we granted 92,201 stock options to our executive officers and non-employee directors.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P4_S2	We estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P4_S3	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	The total expense for stock-based compensation is distributed with other employee compensation costs in the appropriate operating expense categories of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based compensation.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	(2) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P6_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P7_S0	(3) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P7_S1	These cash inflows are offset by cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program, which we began in the fourth quarter of 2010 and dividend payments.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P7_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P8_S0	(4) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P8_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P8_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P8_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P8_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P9_S0	(5) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_13_ITEM6_P9_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others, general industry conditions and competition, including current global financial uncertainty; the impact of market volatility on revenue from asset-based fees; damage to our reputation resulting from claims made about possible conflicts of interest; liability for any losses that result from an actual or claimed breach of our fiduciary duties; financial services industry consolidation; a prolonged outage of our database and network facilities; challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations; and the availability of free or low-cost investment information.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We offer an extensive line of data, software, and research products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also offer asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Morningstar has two operating segments: Investment Information and Investment Management.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	These products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Investment Management segment includes our asset management operations, which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	We emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Over our 28-year history, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	From 2006 through 2010, we also completed 24 acquisitions to support our growth strategies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	We sell most of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Equity Research, Retirement Solutions, and some of our structured credit research and ratings offerings, through license agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as newsletters, Principia software, and Premium service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	For our Investment Advisory services, we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We also earn fees relating to Morningstar Managed Portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Overall, revenue tied to asset-based fees accounted for about 12% of our consolidated revenue in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $146.0 million as of December 31, 2012 and $155.5 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments, through multiple media, and in many geographical markets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	In general, our businesses have high fixed costs, and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	We believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower, particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	At times, we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short-term operating results.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	When revenue decreases, however, the operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold, development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases, data lines, postage, printing, and shareholder servicing fees for Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	This category includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	We amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software, which is generally three years, and include this expense in depreciation and amortization.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing programs to promote our products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment's management team, as well as human resources, finance, and support employees for each segment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs, including corporate systems, finance and accounting, legal, compliance, and facilities expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our capital expenditures consist of computers, leasehold improvements, and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	We amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have majority-owned operations in 25 countries outside of the United States and include these in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We account for our minority-owned investments in Japan and Sweden using the equity method.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value-the value of the company's future cash flows, discounted to their worth in today's dollars.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price, or to take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not be in the long-term interest of building shareholder value.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Organic revenue is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate a retention rate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	We use two different methods for calculating retention.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	For subscription-based products (including our print newsletters, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and Principia software), we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P27_S6	The retention rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Despite lingering concerns about the pending fiscal cliff and the strength of the economic recovery, the U.S. stock market finished 2012 with double-digit returns for the year, following only a slight positive return in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year up 16.3%.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Global markets closed out the year with similarly strong results.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Total U.S. mutual fund assets rose to $13.0 trillion as of December 31, 2012, compared with $11.6 trillion as of December 31, 2011, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were positive for the year, investors continued to heavily favor fixed-income funds rather than equity funds.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Based on Morningstar's analysis of fund flow trends, fixed-income funds experienced net inflows of more than $300 billion in 2012, but equity funds had net outflows of approximately $100 billion.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend, with total assets increasing but asset flows favoring fixed-income funds.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	This trend continued in 2012, as passively managed vehicles had more than $260 billion in net inflows, compared with about $190 billion of net inflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The number of mutual funds in the United States was essentially unchanged (excluding multiple share classes), with about 7,600 funds in both 2012 and 2011 based on ICI data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The number of global mutual funds rose to about 73,500 as of September 30, 2012, compared with about 72,000 as of September 30, 2011, based on ICI data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2012 with more than $1.3 trillion in assets under management based on ICI data, up from about $1 trillion at the end of 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Based on data from ComScore, aggregate page views to financial and investment sites declined by about 9% in 2012, while the number of pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit were each down roughly 20%.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The number of unique visitors, meanwhile, fell about 4%.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We believe these trends reflect individual investors' continuing lower level of interest in financial- and investment-related content in the wake of the market downturn.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	For Morningstar.com, metrics such as pages viewed per visit, time spent per visit, and unique visitors also declined, although unique visitors rose slightly during the fourth quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Amid these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies was weaker in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Although Magna Global, a division of Interpublic Group, estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about 14% across all industries in 2012, financial services companies have been cautious about spending.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new rules for financial services companies globally.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Many of these relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and an emphasis on "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in December 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Advisors are now required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	We believe this requirement may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types, which we offer through products such as Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the European Union, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is a set of EU directives designed to enable funds to operate across the EU based upon authorization from one state regulator.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	UCITS IV, which came into effect in July 2011, included requirements for a new Key Investor Information Document (KIID), an easy-to-read annual factsheet that replaces the Simplified Prospectus.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Every UCITS fund that is promoted to retail investors is now required to produce a KIID and issue an updated copy each year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	We've started using our data and production capabilities to help fund companies produce and distribute these documents.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	In Australia, the government has introduced a series of Future of Financial Advice reforms, with implementation voluntary beginning in July 2012 and mandatory beginning in July 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Many of these related to fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) into law in July 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Dodd-Frank creates a number of new regulatory, supervisory, and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of U.S. financial markets and activities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Dodd-Frank also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action, giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	As a result, the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Dodd-Frank included a number of corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to publicly traded companies generally.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	It also included changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies granting the SEC more oversight over Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including our Morningstar Credit Ratings subsidiary.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	While we believe Dodd-Frank and related regulations will not have a significant effect on Morningstar (other than Morningstar Credit Ratings), we continue to monitor the potential impact on our clients.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We are also monitoring a pending amendment to the Department of Labor's ERISA underwriting exemptions that would expand the number of approved rating agencies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	In many cases, market issuers favor ratings from ERISA-approved agencies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Morningstar Credit Ratings doesn't currently qualify as an ERISA-eligible agency under existing Department of Labor requirements, but would qualify under the proposed amendment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	As noted in How We Evaluate Our Business, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Please refer to the discussion on page 45 for more detail.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years and had two divestitures in 2012, comparing our financial results from year to year is complex.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	To make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods, we provide information on both organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations, and revenue from acquisitions and divestitures.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	We include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for 12 months after we complete the acquisition.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	After that, we include it in organic revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	We include a divested operation as part of revenue from divestitures for 12 months after we complete the divestiture.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Consolidated organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The table below shows the period in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	In 2012, our consolidated revenue increased 4.3% to $658.3 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	We had no incremental revenue during 2012 from acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our 2011 results included revenue of $1.1 million from businesses that we sold in 2012 and that did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	Currency movements had a negative effect, lowering revenue growth by $4.6 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, were the primary contributors to the negative currency impact.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations, our consolidated revenue rose by $32.6 million , or 5.2% , in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Leading the growth was Morningstar Direct, followed by Morningstar Data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Morningstar Advisor Workstation and Integrated Web Tools also contributed to the organic revenue increase, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	These factors helped offset the loss of business from the largest client in our Investment Management segment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P49_S4	We recognized $3.8 million in associated revenue in 2012 compared with $12.4 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	In 2011, our consolidated revenue increased 13.7% to $631.4 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	We had $15.3 million in incremental revenue during 2011 from acquisitions completed in 2010, mainly reflecting incremental revenue from Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC (formerly Realpoint, LLC) and, to a lesser extent, the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation and Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Acquisitions contributed about 2.8 percentage points to our consolidated revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Currency movements also had a positive effect, contributing approximately 1.8 percentage points to revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, the euro, and the Canadian dollar were the primary contributors to the currency benefit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Excluding acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translations, our consolidated revenue rose $50.6 million , or 9.1% , in 2011 , with increases across all major product lines.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Leading the growth were Morningstar Direct and Investment Advisory Services, followed by Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Internet advertising sales from Morningstar.com, Retirement Solutions, and Structured Credit Ratings also contributed to the organic revenue increase, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Revenue from international operations was down slightly as a percentage of total revenue in 2012 compared with 2011 and up slightly compared with 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our non-U.S. revenue was 29.1% of consolidated revenue in 2012 , compared with 29.3% in 2011 and 28.3% in 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	More than half of our international revenue came from Europe, with most of the remainder from Australia and Canada.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	Divested businesses contributed $1.0 million to 2011 revenue that did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Foreign currency translations had a negative effect on international revenue in 2012, but a positive effect in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Foreign currency translations decreased revenue by $4.6 million in 2012 , but increased revenue by $10.1 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations, non-U.S. revenue rose 6.5% in 2012 and 7.7% in 2011 , primarily reflecting stronger product sales in Europe and Canada, partially offset by lower revenue in Australia.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our five largest products based on revenue Morningstar Data (previously Licensed Data), Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Investment Advisory Services (previously Investment Consulting), and Morningstar.com made up 63.9% of consolidated revenue in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	While the percentage of revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent over the past three years, the relative size of products within the top five has changed each year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Morningstar Data has been our largest product for the last three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Beginning in 2012, we reviewed the revenue classification for our Morningstar Data product.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Morningstar Data product now includes Morningstar Commodity Data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	In addition, as part of our global product structure, we reviewed the revenue classification for our Investment Advisory Services (previously Investment Consulting) revenue to better align our non-U.S. operations with our U.S. product definitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	Subsequent to the first quarter, we made some additional, minor reclassifications for Morningstar Advisor Workstation and Morningstar.com.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	We reclassified the prior-year information for consistency with the current-year presentation.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	As presented in the tables below, these reclassifications changed the order of Advisor Workstation and Investment Advisory Services in our top five products in 2011, but did not have any effect on the order of our top five products in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data, Investment Advisory Services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between 90% and 95%, within the same range as 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	While the loss of business from our largest client had a negative effect on the renewal rate for Investment Advisory Services, renewals for other major products were slightly higher, on average, than in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2012, we estimate that our retention rate for subscription-based products, such as Principia, Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, and print and online newsletters, was between 65% and 70%, within the same range as 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	In 2012 , our consolidated operating expense increased $14.6 million or 3.0% .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Higher salary expense of $14.0 million was the primary driver of the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	The majority of the increase in salary expense reflects the full-year effect of regular pay raises and market adjustments made in July 2011, as well as regular pay raises made in July 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The rest of the increase represents the full-year salary impact of 2011 new hires and incremental expense for new hires in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We review employee salaries annually and implemented salary adjustments in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	We had approximately 3,495 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2012 , compared with 3,465 as of December 31, 2011 and 3,225 as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Higher professional fees, production expense, company-sponsored benefits, including matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, and stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase in operating expense, although to a lesser extent than the salary expense discussed above.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense in 2012 includes $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to a former executive in the structured credit research unit when we acquired the business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	Additional data purchases contributed to the $3.8 million growth in production expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was lower bonus expense of approximately $6.4 million in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Lower discretionary spending, including advertising and marketing and travel expense also offset the increases.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, we capitalized $8.5 million of operating expense in 2012, primarily for software development.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	In comparison, we capitalized $5.3 million of operating expense in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	General and administrative expense (G A) in 2012 included about $1.6 million for a litigation settlement and an impairment charge for one of our smaller products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, our results included a benefit of approximately $1.0 million for the resolution of a prior-year business tax expense matter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Conversely, our results in 2011 included $1.4 million of expense related to this business tax.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	Our G A results for 2011 also included $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	This expense did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Intangible amortization expense decreased $3.3 million , primarily because certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	In addition, our 2011 results included $1.6 million of expense for the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	Offsetting the decrease in amortization expense was higher depreciation expense of $3.5 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.0 percentage point in 2012, as the 4.3% increase in revenue slightly outpaced the 3.0% increase in operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2011 , our consolidated operating expense increased $58.7 million or 13.5% .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	We completed seven acquisitions in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Because of the timing of these acquisitions, our results include operating expense that did not exist in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	Incremental operating expense from acquired businesses represented approximately $13.4 million, or 23%, of the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Higher salary expense represented approximately 55%, or $32.0 million, of the total operating expense increase in 2011, reflecting additional hiring in 2011 and the full-year salary effect of 2010 new hires, and, to a lesser extent, additional headcount from acquisitions completed in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Salary adjustments that were effective in July 2011 also contributed to the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	We review employee salaries annually and have generally implemented salary adjustments in the third quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	We had approximately 3,465 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2011 , compared with 3,225 as of December 31, 2010 and 2,605 as of December 31, 2009.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	About half of the headcount growth in 2011 reflects continued hiring for our development centers in China and India, with most of the remainder in the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The latter includes about 30 employees hired in July 2011 in Chicago as part of the Morningstar Development Program, a two-year rotational training program for entry-level employees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately 24%, or $14.1 million, of the overall operating expense increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Higher bonus expense and sales commissions both contributed to the growth in incentive compensation.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Bonus expense rose $5.7 million, which was slightly offset by a $0.4 million gap between bonuses paid in the first quarter and the amount accrued in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Although total bonuses paid were $0.4 million lower than the amount accrued, there were some greater differences by cost category, which we describe below.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	Sales commission expense was up $2.8 million, primarily in the United States and Europe.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	In 2011, we reinstated some of the benefits we temporarily suspended in previous years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	This included increasing the matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, representing $2.3 million of additional expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Higher production expense, travel, and rent expense also contributed to operating expense growth, although to a lesser extent than the compensation-related items discussed above.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Higher data purchases for our operations in the U.S. and Europe contributed to the $4.2 million growth in production expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	The $1.5 million increase in rent expense primarily reflects higher rent for our new office space in Shenzhen, China, and, to a lesser extent, for our office space in Chicago.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Our 2010 results included an expense of $1.0 million to increase liabilities for vacant office space.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	This expense did not recur in 2011, partially offsetting the higher rent expense in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	Intangible amortization expense increased $2.4 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase primarily reflects amortization expense from 2010 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our 2011 results include $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Operating expense in 2010 included $2.0 million related to the separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	This expense did not recur in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	We capitalized $5.3 million of operating expense in 2011, primarily for software development within the Structured Credit Ratings business, Morningstar Commodity Data, and for Morningstar Direct.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	In 2010, we capitalized $0.8 million of operating expense for software development.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.1 percentage points in 2011, as the 13.7% increase in revenue slightly outpaced the 13.5% increase in operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense, representing more than one-third of our total operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	Approximately one-half of our employees are included in this cost category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cost of goods sold rose $13.2 million in 2012 and $25.1 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Higher salaries contributed approximately 55% and 50% of the total increase in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily from additional headcount.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Higher production expense of $3.8 million and $4.2 million also contributed to the increase in both years, primarily from additional data purchases for our operations in the U.S. and Europe.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	Other compensation-related expense, primarily employee benefit costs, also contributed to the increase in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	In 2011, higher bonus expense of $3.8 million for the 2011 annual bonus was offset by a $1.6 million reduction in bonus expense related to the prior-year bonus because we paid a smaller portion of the 2011 bonus to employees in this category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Please refer to the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Approximately 20% of the increase in 2011 was related to acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our gross margin declined by about 0.9 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points in 2012 and 2011 , respectively, as expenses in this category increased at a faster rate compared with revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Development expense decreased $1.7 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	We capitalized $8.5 million of operating expense in 2012 compared with $5.3 million in 2011 for software development, reducing the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	Lower bonus expense of $1.8 million also contributed to the decline.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	Higher salaries and other compensation-related expense for our development teams partially offset the favorable effect of the capitalized operating expense in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Development expense increased $3.9 million in 2011 mainly because of higher salaries, benefits, and bonus expense for our development teams.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	We capitalized $5.3 million of operating expense in 2011 and $0.8 million in 2010 for software development, reducing the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Development expense from acquisitions also contributed to the increase in 2011, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	We had approximately 820 employees included in development expense as of December 31, 2012 compared with 830 as of December 31, 2011 and 760 as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	As a percentage of revenue, development expense was down slightly in 2012 and 2011, primarily reflecting the effect of capitalizing operating expense for software development.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $2.2 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Higher salary expense of $4.1 million and higher bonus expense of $1.5 million were partially offset by lower advertising and marketing expense and lower commissions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Full-year bonus expense was flat in 2012; however, in the first quarter of 2012, we paid a greater portion of the 2011 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $1.0 million to the bonus expense recorded in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	Please refer to the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $11.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Approximately 17% of the growth in sales and marketing expense in the year was related to acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	Higher salary-related expense represents about 53% of the overall expense increase in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	Higher sales commission expense, other compensation-related expenses, and travel expense also contributed to the increase in the year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	Lower bonus expense partially offset the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down in 2012 primarily reflecting lower advertising and marketing expense and commissions as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down in 2011, primarily reflecting lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	General and Administrative (G A) expense rose $0.8 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Higher professional fees and higher stock-based compensation expense contributed to the total increase in G A. Our stock-based compensation expense in 2012 includes $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to a former executive in the structured credit research unit when we acquired the business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Lower bonus expense of $5.7 million in 2012 partially offset the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	Current-year bonus expense was down $2.8 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S4	In addition, in the first quarter of 2011, we paid a greater portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $2.6 million to the bonus expense recorded in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P95_S5	Please refer to the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	G A expense in 2012 included about $1.6 million of expense for a litigation settlement and an impairment charge for one of our smaller products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	However, as mentioned above, our 2012 results included a benefit of approximately $1.0 million from the resolution of a prior-year business tax expense matter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	Conversely, our results for 2011 included $1.4 million of expense related to this business tax.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	G A in 2011 also included $3.2 million for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P96_S4	This expense did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	G A rose $15.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Higher compensation-related expense including salaries, bonus expense, and other compensation-related costs contributed about 70% of the total increase in G A expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	Bonus expense included in G A expense increased $3.6 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	In the first quarter of 2011, we paid a greater portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $2.6 million of the full-year increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	Please refer to the section, Bonus Expense, for additional information.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Higher rent expense, mainly for our office space in China and additional office space in Chicago, also contributed to the growth in G A expense, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	G A expense in 2011 included a $0.8 million reduction in sales tax accruals and a $2.0 million business tax rebate for our operations in China.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	Partially offsetting these two items was $1.4 million of business tax expense related to prior years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	G A expense in 2011 also includes $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	Our 2010 results include $1.0 million to increase liabilities for vacant office space and $2.0 million related to a previously announced separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P99_S4	These two expenses did not recur in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	G A expense as a percentage of revenue was down 0.6 percentage points in 2012 after increasing 0.4 percentage points in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Depreciation expense rose $3.5 million in 2012 , primarily related to increased capital expenditures for our operations in the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Depreciation expense increased $0.8 million in 2011 , primarily related to our new office space in China.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Amortization expense decreased $3.3 million in 2012 , primarily because certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	In addition, our 2011 results included $1.6 million of expense for the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	Amortization expense increased $2.4 million in 2011 , reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	We estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be $21.2 million in 2013 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and currency translations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was down slightly in 2012 and 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Stock-based compensation expense relates to grants of restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs has increased over the past three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	We began granting RSUs in May 2006 and have made additional grants each year since then.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	We recognize the expense related to RSUs over the vesting period, which is four years for employees and three years for non-employee directors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P106_S3	We estimate forfeitures for these awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the third quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P106_S4	The expense recorded in 2011 was favorably affected by $0.5 million for restricted stock units that were forfeited in the first quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Restricted Stock: Beginning in 2010, we began recording expense related to restricted stock issued with the acquisition of Realpoint.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	In May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares that will vest over five years from the date of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	The expense in 2012 and 2011 includes $3.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for accelerated vesting of a portion of this restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Stock Options: We did not grant any stock options in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	In 2011, we granted 92,201 stock options to our executive officers and non-employee directors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	These stock options vest ratably over a four-year period for executive officers and a three-year period for non-employee directors and expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	Using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, we estimated the fair value of these grants.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	We amortize this value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the options' vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	We estimate forfeitures of these awards and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the third quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	We describe our stock-based compensation in more detail in Note 12 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Stock-based compensation is included in each of our operating expense categories, as shown below:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Based on grants of RSUs, stock options, and restricted stock made through December 31, 2012 , we anticipate that stock-based compensation expense will be $13.5 million in 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	This amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or changes in our estimated forfeiture rate related to these grants.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	The amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Instead, the size of the bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items, including changes in full-year operating income relative to the previous year and other factors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	We review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly, primarily based on our expectations for full-year operating income relative to budget.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	We record bonus expense throughout the year and pay annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Bonus expense, which we include in each of our operating expense categories, decreased $6.4 million in 2012 and increased $ 5.3 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Overall, bonus expense represented about 5.5% , 6.8% , and 6.7% of revenue in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Bonus expense consisted of both the current-year bonus expense and the true-up related to the prior-year bonus accrual.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	We adjust the prior-year bonus estimate to the actual bonus payout during the first quarter, which is when the payout occurs.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P115_S2	This true-up had a favorable effect of $0.1 million on total bonus expense in 2012 and $0.4 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	While total bonuses paid out in 2012 and 2011 were only slightly lower compared with the amounts expensed in 2011 and 2010, respectively, there were some differences by cost category.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The table below presents the effect of these two factors by cost category and in total for 2012 and 2011:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $12.3 million in 2012 , and our margin was up 1.0 percentage point in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	Our revenue growth of $26.9 million outpaced the increase in our costs of $14.6 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Lower bonus expense contributed 1.3 percentage points to our margin growth in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	In addition, capitalized operating expense for software development contributed 0.5 percentage points to our margin growth in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	Higher salaries and other compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset these increases.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $17.4 million , and our margin was up slightly in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	We had revenue growth of $76.0 million , which outpaced expense growth of $58.7 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Capitalized operating expense for software development contributed 0.7 percentage points to our margin growth in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	Higher salaries and other compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset the benefit of the capitalized operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	In addition, acquisitions had a slight negative effect on the margin.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	We generated positive free cash flow in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded capital expenditures, as shown below:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Free cash flow decreased $25.7 million in 2012 and increased $33.0 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	Cash provided by operating activities: Cash provided by operating activities decreased $19.0 million in 2012 , reflecting the negative cash flow effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, a $9.3 million increase in cash paid for taxes, and a $5.3 million increase in bonuses paid in the first quarter of 2012 , partially offset by higher net income (adjusted for non-cash items).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	We made cash payments of $47.4 million for income taxes in 2012, compared with $38.1 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	We made bonus payments of $42.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 , compared with $37.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Cash provided by operating activities increased $41.6 million in 2011 , reflecting the positive cash flow effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net income (adjusted for non-cash items), partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in bonuses paid in the first quarter of 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	We made bonus payments of $37.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 , compared with $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	To provide investors with additional insight into our financial results, we provide a comparison between the change in consolidated net income and the change in operating cash flow:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	In 2012 , the decrease in cash from operations more than offset the positive change in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily because of the negative cash flow effect of accounts receivable and accrued compensation.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	An increase in cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for bonuses also contributed to the decrease.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	In 2011 , the increase in cash from operations exceeded the change in net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily because of the positive cash flow effect of accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and income taxes current.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	In addition, the cash flow from operations in 2010 includes a $4.9 million payment related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options (ISOs).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	This payment did not recur in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	These items, which favorably affected the year-over-year comparison, were partially offset by the increase in bonus payments in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P129_S4	Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also reflects $4.1 million of payments for separation agreements with two former executives.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity, which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	In 2012 and 2011 , we classified $7.2 million and $9.5 million , respectively, of excess tax benefits as financing activities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P130_S2	We describe these excess tax benefits in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	Capital expenditures: We spent $30.0 million for capital expenditures in 2012 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed capitalized software, and spending for an expansion of office space in Chicago.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	We spent $23.3 million for capital expenditures in 2011 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed capitalized software, and leasehold improvements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	In 2012 , capital expenditures increased $6.7 million , primarily for capitalized software and computer hardware and software for our U.S. operations and internally developed capitalized software.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	These products are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Morningstar Data (formerly Licensed Data), Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar.com, Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, and Morningstar Principia.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	Morningstar Data is a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases, including real-time pricing and commodity data, and is available through electronic data feeds.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	Advisor Workstation is a web-based investment planning system for advisors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	Advisor Workstation is available in two editions: Morningstar Office for independent financial advisors and an enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Morningstar Direct is a web-based institutional research platform.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Morningstar.com includes both Premium Memberships and Internet advertising sales.

1289419_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	The segment also includes Morningstar Credit Research and Morningstar Structured Credit Ratings.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	The latter is provided by Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization specializing in structured finance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P141_S4	It offers securities ratings, research, surveillance services, and data to help institutional investors identify risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	We also offer a variety of financial communications and newsletters, other institutional and advisor software, and investment indexes.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	This segment represented approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	In 2012 , Investment Information segment revenue increased $29.1 million , or 5.8% , to $530.0 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	Our software, data, and investment research product lines all contributed to the revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P144_S2	Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation were the main contributors to revenue growth in 2012, partially offset by lower revenue for Morningstar.com.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P144_S3	In addition, our 2011 results included revenue of about $1.1 million from businesses that we sold in 2012 that did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	Investment Information segment revenue increased $56.0 million , or 12.6% , to $500.9 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	Acquisitions contributed $13.5 million of revenue in 2011 , primarily from Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC and to a lesser extent from the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation (ASMC), Morningstar Denmark, and OBSR.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	Revenue from acquisitions represented approximately 3 percentage points of the revenue increase in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S3	Excluding acquisitions, our software, data, and investment research product lines all contributed to the revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S4	Organic revenue for our software product lines was up $26.2 million, driven by Morningstar Direct, and to a lesser extent by Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar.com.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P145_S5	Morningstar Data and Morningstar Credit Ratings drove revenue growth in our data and investment research product lines, respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	Morningstar Direct was the largest contributor to the increase in segment revenue in both 2012 and 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	Morningstar Direct contributed approximately 43% and 39% of the organic revenue growth for the segment in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P146_S2	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 7,435 worldwide, compared with 6,144 as of December 31, 2011 and 4,773 as of December 31, 2010 , with strong growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P146_S3	The growth reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients, and, to a lesser extent, client migrations from both Institutional Workstation and Morningstar EnCorr to Morningstar Direct.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	Morningstar Data was the second-largest contributor to segment revenue growth in both 2012 and 2011 , reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts for managed products data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	Morningstar Data gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data and commodity data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	The data packages we offer include proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, and ownership.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	Higher revenue from Morningstar Integrated Web Tools and Advisor Workstation (mainly Morningstar Office) also contributed to revenue growth in 2012 and 2011, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	The number of U.S. licenses for Morningstar Advisor Workstation increased to 162,904 as of December 31, 2012 compared with 160,287 as of December 31, 2011 , and 157,395 as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	The increase in the number of U.S. licenses compared with December 31, 2010 was partially due to incremental licenses added through our acquisition of ASMC.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P149_S3	Lower revenue for Principia partially offset the higher revenue from these two products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Principia subscriptions totaled 26,807 as of December 31, 2012 , down from 31,270 as of December 31, 2011 and 32,681 as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Revenue for Morningstar.com, which includes Internet advertising sales and Premium Membership subscriptions, decreased in 2012, but contributed to the growth in the segment's revenue in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	Revenue was down in 2012 because of declining paid Premium subscriptions, primarily in the United States, and a difficult advertising sales market.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S2	The increase in 2011 Morningstar.com revenue was driven entirely by higher Internet advertising sales.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S3	Internet advertising revenue decreased 4.2% in 2012 compared with an increase of 18.8% in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S4	Premium subscriptions for the U.S. version of Morningstar.com declined to 123,899 as of December 31, 2012 , compared with 130,354 as of December 31, 2011 and 138,149 as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P151_S5	However, consistent with the trend over the past few years, we moderately increased subscription prices for U.S. Premium Membership in both January 2012 and 2011 , which partly offset the revenue decline associated with the lower subscription levels.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	Newsletter revenue declined in both 2012 and 2011, primarily because of lower advertising sales for our trade magazines in Australia.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	Revenue for our investment research products was up in 2012 and 2011, mainly reflecting higher revenue for equity and fund research.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	Structured Credit Ratings also contributed to the increase in 2011, but was up only slightly in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Revenue growth was slow in 2012 because of competitive pricing pressure.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	Within the structured credit ratings business in 2011, we had strong revenue growth earlier in the year driven by new issue rating assignments in the CMBS market.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	In 2011, we rated 13 new issue CMBS deals, more than double the number in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	In 2012 , operating income for the Investment Information segment increased $19.2 million , or 14.6% , as revenue rose more than operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	Operating expense was up $9.9 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	Higher salary-related expense, which increased $11.3 million compared with 2011, was the primary contributor to the increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P156_S2	Company-sponsored benefits, including matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, stock-based compensation expense, and production expense also contributed to the increase in operating expense, although to a lesser extent than salary expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P156_S3	Our stock-based compensation expense in 2012 includes $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of a portion of a restricted stock grant.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P156_S4	Additional data purchases for our operations in the United States and Europe contributed to the growth in production expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	Lower incentive compensation, including bonus expense and commissions, and discretionary costs, including advertising, marketing, and travel, partially offset the higher expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	Bonus expense decreased $4.6 million in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Investment Information segment's operating margin increased 2.1 percentage points in 2012 , primarily reflecting lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue, and, to a lesser extent, lower commission expense and discretionary spending as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	Lower bonus expense contributed 1.2 percentage points to the margin improvement in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	In 2011 , operating income for the Investment Information segment increased $3.8 million , or 3.0% , as revenue grew more than operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	Operating expense was up $52.2 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	Additional costs from acquisitions contributed approximately 18% of this increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S2	Higher salary-related expense and incentive compensation, including sales commission and bonus expense, contributed about 71% of the overall expense increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S3	Higher salary-related expense reflects additional hiring in 2011 and the full-year salary impact of 2010 new hires, and, to a lesser extent, additional headcount from acquisitions completed in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S4	Salary adjustments that were effective in July 2011 also contributed to the growth in salary expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P160_S5	Costs for employee benefits, including health care and matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States, contributed about 9% of the increase in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	The Investment Information segment's operating margin decreased 2.4 percentage points in 2011 , primarily because of higher salary expense as a percentage of revenue, and, to a lesser extent, employee benefit and bonus costs as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P161_S1	Higher salary expense contributed 2.0 percentage points to the decline in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	Acquisitions had only a minor effect on the segment margin.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	The Investment Management segment includes all of our asset management operations, which earn more than half of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	The key products and services in this segment based on revenue are Investment Advisory Services (formerly Investment Consulting), which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for multimanager portfolios, including mutual funds and variable annuities; Retirement Solutions, including the Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson platforms; and Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons, risk levels, and investment strategies that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax-deferred accounts.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	Our Investment Advisory Services business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S5	The method of calculation varies by client; some contracts include provisions for calculating average assets based on daily data, while others use weekly or monthly data.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P165_S6	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	In our Retirement Solutions business, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	Our Retirement Solutions business also includes plan sponsor and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement in these arrangements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Advisory Services and Retirement Solutions businesses because our fee structures are customized by client.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range would be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P167_S2	We disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our SEC filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	Fees for our mutual fund and ETF portfolios generally range from 30 to 40 basis points.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P168_S2	We charge fees of 55 basis points for our customized stock portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	In addition, we offer Managed Portfolios through our subsidiary Ibbotson Associates Australia, which provides asset management services primarily to institutional clients and individual investors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	This segment represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	Investment Management segment revenue decreased $2.2 million , or 1.7% , in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	Our largest client in the Investment Management segment began managing several fund-of-funds portfolios in-house in April 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	We recognized $3.8 million in associated revenue in 2012 compared with $12.4 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P172_S2	Excluding the loss of this business, Investment Advisory Services revenue was up $3.4 million in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P172_S3	Revenue for Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and to a lesser extent, Retirement Solutions, also rose in 2012, partially offsetting the loss of business discussed above.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	Investment Management segment revenue increased $20.1 million , or 18.2% , in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	Revenue from acquisitions was $1.9 million , primarily from the OBSR and Seeds acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S2	Excluding acquisitions, revenue was up across all three of our key product and service lines in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S3	Investment Advisory Services was the primary driver of the revenue increase and was driven by higher revenue in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Europe.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S4	Retirement Solutions and Managed Portfolios also contributed to the revenue increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P173_S5	Managed Portfolios for Ibbotson Associates Australia was down, partially offsetting the revenue growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	The variable annuity industry, which accounted for approximately 15% of Investment Management segment revenue in 2012, continues to face challenges.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	Accordingly, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from clients in the variable annuity industry.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	We had $81.4 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2012 , a slight decrease of $0.3 million compared with $81.7 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	In 2010 , revenue from asset-based fees was $67.7 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P175_S2	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12.4% of consolidated revenue in 2012 , down slightly from 12.9% in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P175_S3	Within the Investment Management segment, revenue from asset-based fees made up slightly more than 60% of segment revenue over the past three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	Total assets under advisement and management were $149.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 , a decrease from $180.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 and up slightly from $149.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	As mentioned above, our largest Investment Management client began managing several fund-of-fund portfolios in-house in April 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	These portfolios represented $11.8 billion of our assets as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P177_S2	In addition, a change in the scope of services we provide to an existing client during the fourth quarter of 2012 lowered our assets by about $42.9 billion.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P177_S3	About $22 billion of the total assets as of December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 reflects additional assets for existing clients' fund-of-funds programs for which we now receive asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P177_S4	The increase in assets represents incremental growth for an existing revenue stream.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	The asset totals as of the end of each year don't fully reflect the change in average asset levels during the year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	The asset-based fees we earn are primarily based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P178_S2	Average assets under advisement and management (calculated based on available quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $180.6 million in 2012 , up 9.3% from $165.3 billion in 2011 , and up 52.1% from $118.7 billion in 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	We provided Investment Advisory Services on $94.3 billion in assets as of December 31, 2012 compared with $137.5 billion in assets as of December 31, 2011 and $108.0 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	We also provide Investment Advisory services for some assets for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	Assets under advisement and management decreased $43.2 billion , or 31.4% , compared with December 31, 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	As mentioned above, our largest Investment Management client began managing several fund-of-funds portfolios in-house in April 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P183_S1	These portfolios represented $11.8 billion, or 8.6% of our Investment Advisory Services assets under advisement and management as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P183_S2	In addition, a change in the scope of services we provide to an existing client lowered our assets by about $42.9 billion.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P183_S3	Excluding these effects, assets under advisement and management rose 8.3%, primarily reflecting asset inflows and market performance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Total assets under advisement and management for Investment Advisory Services as of December 31, 2011 increased 27.3% compared with December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P184_S1	Approximately 75% of the increase reflects additional assets for existing clients' fund-of-funds programs for which we now receive asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P184_S2	The remainder of the increase reflects net client inflows and market performance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	We cannot separately quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios because we do not have custody of the assets in the majority of our investment management businesses.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	The information we receive from many of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	We also cannot precisely quantify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	Assets under management for managed retirement accounts increased to $25.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 compared with $ 19.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $ 19.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	Assets under advisement for plan sponsor and custom target-date arrangements increased to $22.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 , compared with $ 17.5 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $ 15.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	We cannot separately quantify the factors affecting assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	These factors primarily consist of employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	We cannot quantify the impact of these other factors because the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	The table below shows the number of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through our Retirement Solutions programs, as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	Revenue for Morningstar Managed Portfolios increased $2.9 million in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	The growth mainly reflects higher average asset levels during 2012 compared with 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P189_S2	Assets under management for Morningstar Managed Portfolios were $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2012 , compared with $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 , reflecting positive market performance and strong net inflows.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P189_S3	Revenue for Morningstar Managed Portfolios increased $2.4 million in 2011, reflecting higher average asset levels during 2011 compared with 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P189_S4	Assets under management for Morningstar Managed Portfolios were $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared with $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 , reflecting strong net inflows.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	Revenue for Ibbotson Associates Australia Managed Portfolios declined about $0.7 million in 2012 and $1.1 million in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	The lower revenue mainly reflects slightly lower average assets levels during 2012 compared with 2011 and 2011 compared with 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	Assets under management for Ibbotson Australia totaled $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 , up from $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 , and down slightly compared with $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	Operating income for the Investment Management segment decreased $8.5 million , or 12.2% , in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	In 2011 , operating income increased $12.8 million , or 22.6% .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	In 2012, revenue increased less than operating expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	Operating expense in the segment rose $6.3 million , or 10.4% , in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	Operating expense rose primarily because of higher professional fees and compensation-related expense, including higher salaries and commissions, in the United States as well as higher expense for operations outside of the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P192_S2	Lower bonus expense of $2.6 million partially offset these factors.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	In 2011 , operating expense in this segment rose $7.3 million , or 13.6% .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	Additional costs from acquisitions contributed approximately 25% of the total operating expense increase.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P193_S2	Excluding acquisitions, higher operating expenses for operations outside of the United States contributed the majority of the operating expense growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P193_S3	Higher salaries and professional fees also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	Bonus expense was essentially unchanged from the previous.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	Operating expense in 2010 included $2.0 million related to a separation agreement between Morningstar and the former head of Morningstar Associates.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P194_S2	This expense did not recur in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	Operating margin decreased 5.8 percentage points to 47.6% in 2012 , as operating expense growth exceeded the growth in revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	Higher professional fees, costs for operations outside the United States, and salary expense, all as a percentage of revenue, contributed to the margin decline.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	Lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset these increases.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	The segment's operating margin increased 1.9 percentage points to 53.4% in 2011 , as revenue growth exceeded the change in operating expenses.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	Lower salary expense and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue contributed to the increase, partially offset by higher expenses outside of the United Stated and higher professional fees as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	In addition, acquisitions had a slight negative effect on the margin in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P196_S3	The 2010 margin was negatively affected by the $2.0 million separation agreement, which reduced the 2010 margin by approximately 2.0 percentage points.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	This category includes general corporate costs, which we do not allocate to our business segments.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	The corporate items category also includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded for acquisitions and capitalization of internal product development costs.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P197_S2	The table below shows the components of corporate items that affected our consolidated operating income:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	Amortization of intangible assets decreased $3.3 million in 2012 primarily because certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	In addition, our 2011 results included $1.6 million of expense for the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P198_S2	Amortization expense increased $2.4 million in 2011 , reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P198_S3	The increase was partially offset by the runoff of amortization expense for certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively, we had $116.7 million and $139.8 million of net intangible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P199_S1	We amortize these assets over their estimated lives, ranging from one to 20 years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P199_S2	We estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be approximately $21.2 million in 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	Depreciation expense for corporate items increased $2.3 million in 2012 primarily related to increased capital expenditures for our operations in the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P200_S1	Depreciation expense did not change significantly in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	Corporate unallocated expense decreased $0.6 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P201_S1	In 2012 , we capitalized $8.5 million of expense for software development, compared with $5.3 million in 2011 , favorably affecting the year-over-year comparison.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P201_S2	In addition, our corporate unallocated expense for 2011 included $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P201_S3	This expense did not recur in 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P201_S4	Higher professional fees, salaries, and production expense partially offset these favorable items.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	Corporate unallocated expense decreased $3.3 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S1	In 2011 , we capitalized $5.3 million of expense for software development, compared with $0.8 million in 2010 , favorably affecting the year-over-year comparison.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S2	Lower professional fees also contributed to the decrease, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S3	In addition, a $1.0 million expense related to vacant office space recorded in 2010 did not recur in 2011, favorably affecting the comparison with the previous year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S4	Higher salaries partially offset these favorable items.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P202_S5	In addition, our corporate unallocated expense for 2011 includes $3.2 million of expense for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK), Morningstar Sweden AB, and beginning in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, YCharts, Inc. (YCharts) and Inquiry Financial Europe AB, respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P203_S1	In the first six months of 2010, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities is primarily from our position in MJKK.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	In September 2012, we acquired a 34% minority equity stake in Inquiry Financial Europe AB for $3.6 million, paid in cash.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P205_S1	In November 2011, we acquired a 22% minority equity stake in YCharts for $2.5 million, paid in cash.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P206_S0	In July 2010, we acquired an additional 75% ownership interest in Morningstar Danmark A/S (Morningstar Denmark), increasing our ownership percentage to 100%.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P206_S1	As a result, we no longer account for our investment in Morningstar Denmark using the equity method.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P206_S2	Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Morningstar Denmark in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P207_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P208_S0	The following table presents the components of net non-operating income (expense):
1289419_13_ITEM7_P209_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P209_S1	Interest income in 2012 also includes approximately $0.7 million of interest income related to the $1.0 million of business tax refund for prior years recorded in 2012, as discussed above in the section, Consolidated Results .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P209_S2	The increase in interest income in 2011 reflects higher balances of cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P210_S0	In 2011, interest expense included $0.9 million related to the $1.4 million of business tax expense for prior years recorded in 2011, as discussed above in the section Consolidated Results .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P211_S0	In 2012, other income (expense), net included a loss of $2.0 million on the sale of our investment in Bundle.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P211_S1	We previously accounted for this investment using the cost method.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P211_S2	In 2010, other income (expense), net included a holding gain of approximately $4.6 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P211_S3	This gain represented the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark at the date of acquisition.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P212_S0	Other income (expense), net also includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio, gains and losses on sale of fixed assets, and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P212_S1	The net other expense in 2011 primarily represented unrealized exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P213_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P214_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P215_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2012 was 33.9% , an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared with 30.7% in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P215_S1	The higher tax rate in 2012 reflects lower tax credits and incentives in the current year, as well as certain deferred income tax benefits recorded in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P216_S0	In 2011 , our effective tax rate was 30.7% , a decrease of 2.4 percentage points compared with 33.1% in 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P216_S1	The lower tax rate in 2011 reflects:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P217_S0	the recognition of certain deferred income tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P218_S0	Additionally, in 2010, the use of foreign net operating losses that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance reduced our effective tax rate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P218_S1	This benefit did not recur in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P219_S0	In 2012 , we recorded a net increase of $0.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which increased our income tax expense.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P219_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , we had $12.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $12.7 million , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $10.4 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P219_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we had $12.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $11.9 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $9.8 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P220_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of approximately $6.6 million and a non-current liability of $5.7 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P220_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $5.3 million and a non-current liability of $6.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P220_S2	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P221_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P221_S1	Approximately 42% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2012 is held by our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P221_S2	As such, we believe that our cash balances and investments in the United States, along with cash generated from our U.S. operations, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future, without requiring us to repatriate earnings from these foreign subsidiaries.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P222_S0	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P223_S0	We are currently under audit by federal and various state and local tax authorities in the United States, as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P223_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these audits will conclude in 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P224_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P225_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S0	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S1	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high-quality stand-alone credit ratings.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S2	We also invest a portion of our investments balance (approximately 25% as of December 31, 2012 ) in proprietary Morningstar portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S3	These portfolios may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, or ETFs.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S4	Investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years; the weighted average maturity is approximately one year.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S5	Approximately 58% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2012 was held by our operations in the United States, down from about 80% as of December 31, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P226_S6	We used cash generated from our operations in the United States to fund our share repurchase program and dividends to shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P227_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P227_S1	To date, we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S0	In 2012 , we paid dividends of $25.5 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S1	On December 7, 2012 , our board of directors approved a payment of a dividend of 12.5 cents per share payable on December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of December 17, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S2	This was our fifth dividend payment in 2012 because we opted to pay the dividend in December instead of in January 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S3	We expect to make a recurring dividend payment of 12.5 cents per share in 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S4	In February 2013 , our board of directors declared a dividend of 12.5 cents per share.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P228_S5	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2013 to shareholders of record as of April 12, 2013 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P229_S0	In December 2012, the board approved an increase to our $300 million share repurchase program.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P229_S1	The board approval authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $500 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P229_S2	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P229_S3	In 2012, we repurchased a total of 4,258,258 shares for approximately $256.5 million, of which $4.7 million was settled and paid early in the first quarter of 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P229_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , we had repurchased a total of 5,056,595 shares for $300.9 million under this program.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P230_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $321.4 million, a decrease of $148.8 million compared with $470.2 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P230_S1	The decrease reflects $251.8 million used to repurchase common stock, bonus payments of $42.8 million made during the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2011 bonus, $30.0 million of capital expenditures, and $25.5 million of dividends paid.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P230_S2	In addition, we used cash of approximately $10.3 million to acquire minority equity stakes in HelloWallet LLC and Inquiry Financial Europe AB.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P231_S0	These items, which decreased our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance, were partially offset by cash inflows from net income, adjusted for non-cash items and, to a much lesser extent, cash received of $5.7 million from the sale of two businesses and $4.8 million of cash from stock-option proceeds.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P232_S0	We expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2013 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $36 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P233_S0	Our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P234_S0	In 2012 , cash provided by operating activities was $146.0 million, driven by $165.0 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by $19.1 million in changes in our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P234_S1	Accounts receivable was the primary contributor to the unfavorable effect of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P234_S2	A decrease in accrued compensation also contributed to the unfavorable impact of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P234_S3	The decline in accrued compensation primarily reflects the bonus payments made in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $42.8 million, partially offset by the current- year bonus liability as of year-end 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P235_S0	In 2011 , cash provided by operating activities was $165.0 million , driven by $142.6 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of $22.4 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P235_S1	Changes in our operating assets and liabilities mainly benefited from increases in accrued compensation and income taxes.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P235_S2	The growth in accrued compensation primarily reflects the bonus liability as of year-end 2011, partially offset by bonus payments made in the first quarter of 2011 of approximately $37.5 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P235_S3	The cash flow benefit of income taxes was partially offset by tax payments of $38.1 million made during 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P235_S4	Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also reflects $4.1 million of payments for previously announced separation agreements with two former executives.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P236_S0	In 2010 , cash provided by operating activities was $123.4 million , driven by $127.0 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by $3.5 million in changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P236_S1	We paid $21.4 million in annual bonus payments in the first quarter of 2010 and made tax payments of approximately $37.6 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P236_S2	In addition, in 2010 , we paid $4.9 million to one former and two then current executives to adjust the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P236_S3	The cash flow impact of these items was partially offset by the cash flow benefits of accrued compensation and income taxes payable.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P237_S0	Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments less proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments, cash used for capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost-method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P237_S1	The level of investing activities varies from period to period depending on activity in these categories.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P238_S0	Cash provided by investing activities was $80.2 million in 2012 , compared with cash used for investing activities of $110.8 million in 2011 and $87.9 million in 2010 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S0	In 2012 , proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by $114.8 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S1	In contrast, in 2011 , purchases of investments exceeded the proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments by $85.3 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S2	In 2010, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by $28.6 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S3	In 2012, we used these proceeds to fund our share repurchase program.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S4	In 2010, we transferred funds from our investment portfolio to cash and cash equivalents to pay for acquisitions made in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S5	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , we had investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities, of $157.5 million and $269.8 million, respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P239_S6	As of December 31, 2012 , our investments represented 49% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance down from 57% as of December 31, 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P240_S0	Capital expenditures were $30.0 million , $23.3 million , and $14.8 million in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P240_S1	The 2012 capital expenditures reflect spending on computer hardware and software, internally developed capitalized software for our U.S. operations, and an expansion of our office space in Chicago.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P240_S2	The 2011 capital expenditures reflect spending on computer hardware and software and internally developed capitalized software for our U.S. operations as well as remaining payments for our development center in China.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P240_S3	Capital expenditures in 2010 include spending for our office space in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P240_S4	We expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately $33 million to $38 million in 2013, primarily for computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations, and capitalized software.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 or 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S1	In 2011, we received cash of approximately $0.6 million as an adjustment to the purchase price of one of our 2010 acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S2	In 2010 , we completed seven acquisitions for $102.3 million , net of cash acquired.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S3	The majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of Realpoint, OBSR, Morningstar Denmark, and the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corp.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S4	In 2012, we used cash of approximately $10.3 million to acquire minority equity stakes in HelloWallet LLC and Inquiry Financial Europe AB.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P241_S5	In 2011, we used cash of approximately $2.5 million to acquire a minority equity stake in YCharts, Inc.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P242_S0	In 2012, we received cash of approximately $5.7 million as proceeds from the sale of two businesses.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P242_S1	In October 2012, we sold Morningstar Investor Relations Services to UK-based Investis, a leading specialist in digital corporate communications for public companies.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P242_S2	In October 2012, we also sold the Morningstar Australasia trade publishing assets to Sterling Publishing Pty Ltd.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P243_S0	Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P243_S1	These cash inflows may be offset by dividend payments and cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P244_S0	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P244_S1	Similarly, the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P244_S2	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P245_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock-option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P245_S1	As a result, we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P245_S2	Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P246_S0	In 2012 , cash used for financing activities was $265.2 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P246_S1	We paid cash of approximately $251.8 million under our share repurchase program in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P246_S2	In addition, we made dividend payments of $25.5 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P246_S3	Partially offsetting these cash outflows were net proceeds from stock-option exercises of $4.8 million and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units of $7.2 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P247_S0	In 2011, cash used for financing activities was $32.6 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P247_S1	We paid cash of approximately $40.7 million under our share repurchase program in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P247_S2	In addition, we made dividend payments of $10.0 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P247_S3	Partially offsetting these cash outflows were proceeds from stock-option exercises of $8.7 million and excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units of $9.5 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P248_S0	In 2012 , we used cash of $265.2 million for financing activities, compared with $32.6 million in 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P248_S1	The net change of $232.6 million was driven by an increase in cash used to repurchase common shares of $211.1 million and an increase in dividends paid of $15.4 million in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P249_S0	In 2010 , cash provided by financing activities was $12.5 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P249_S1	Proceeds from stock-option exercises totaled $9.2 million , while excess tax benefits related to stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled $7.5 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P249_S2	Partially offsetting these inflows was $3.8 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P249_S3	In 2010 , cash provided by financing activities decreased by $12.8 million , driven by a decrease in proceeds from stock-option exercises, cash used to repurchase common shares, and (to a lesser extent) from a decline in excess tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P250_S0	Employees exercised approximately 0.5 million , 0.7 million , and 0.8 million stock options in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P250_S1	The total intrinsic value (the difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised during 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , was $22.5 million , $29.9 million , and $31.4 million , respectively.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P251_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 or 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P251_S1	We invested a total of $102.0 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P251_S2	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P252_S0	We sold two businesses in 2012 and received a total of $5.7 million related to these sales.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P252_S1	For more information, please see Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P253_S0	See Note 18 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on events subsequent to December 31, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P254_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P254_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 3 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P255_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P256_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P256_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P256_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P256_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P256_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P257_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P258_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P258_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P258_S2	We also provide analysis, consulting, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P258_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P259_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P260_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P261_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P261_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P262_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P262_S1	Probability of collection is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P262_S2	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , our deferred revenue was $146.0 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S3	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S4	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P263_S5	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P264_S0	Between 2006 and 2010, we acquired numerous companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P264_S1	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 or 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P264_S2	In 2010, the total cash paid for acquisitions, less cash acquired, was $102.3 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P264_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we have recorded $320.8 million of goodwill arising from acquisitions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P265_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we allocated $246.8 million of gross value to intangible assets, primarily for customer-related assets, technology-based assets, and intellectual property.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P265_S1	The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to 25 years.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P266_S0	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P266_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P266_S2	Once it has been determined that recognition of an asset or liability in a business combination is appropriate, we generally measure the asset or liability at fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P267_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P268_S0	The determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P269_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P269_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles including internally developed software and databases, and non-compete agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P270_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P270_S1	These valuation approaches include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P271_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P271_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P271_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P271_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P272_S0	Assess the appropriate method for recording amortization expense over the intangible asset's useful life: We use judgment to determine the rate at which the amortization expense should be recognized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P272_S1	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P272_S2	If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method should be used.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P272_S3	Based on this guidance, we amortize intangible assets over their expected useful life using a straight-line amortization method.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P273_S0	We believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P274_S0	Goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 was $320.8 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P275_S0	In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P275_S1	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P276_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P276_S1	In 2011, we altered the definition of our reporting units to align with the definition of our operating segments.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P276_S2	This realignment occurred because of our successful efforts to integrate acquired businesses and leverage proprietary content across multiple products.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P276_S3	As a result, the businesses that previously represented components of our operating segments no longer met the criteria for recognition as reporting units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P277_S0	Our reporting units constitute businesses for which discrete financial information, which is regularly reviewed by management, is available.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P277_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 and did not record any significant impairment losses in these years, reflecting our assessment that our estimates of fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P278_S0	The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P279_S0	In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P279_S1	These estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P280_S0	Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long-term horizon.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P280_S1	We update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P281_S0	We believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P281_S1	If actual results differ from our estimates, future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P281_S2	This would result in a non-cash charge, adversely affecting our results of operations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P282_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 includes $84.0 million of property, equipment, and capitalized software, net of accumulated depreciation, and $116.7 million of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P283_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35 , Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we review our property, equipment, capitalized software, and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P283_S1	Such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P284_S0	If the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P285_S0	Estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P285_S1	They are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P285_S2	Changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment, which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P286_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P286_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P287_S0	Under FASB ASC 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation , stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P288_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P288_S1	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P288_S2	We ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P288_S3	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P288_S4	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P289_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P289_S1	In addition, we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P290_S0	We believe that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P291_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P291_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P292_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P292_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P292_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P292_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P292_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P293_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P293_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P294_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $36.8 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $43.2 million .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P294_S1	The deferred tax assets include $12.4 million of deferred tax assets related to $50.6 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P295_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P295_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $4.0 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P296_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P296_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P296_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P296_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S0	We assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 , Income Taxes.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S1	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S2	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S3	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P297_S5	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P298_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P298_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P299_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P299_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P299_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P300_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P300_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P301_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations, which we describe in Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P301_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P301_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P301_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P302_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-2, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220).
1289419_13_ITEM7_P302_S1	The amended guidance requires us to show the effects of items reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P303_S0	For Morningstar, the ASU No. 2013-2 was effective on January 1, 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P304_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2013-2 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P305_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_13_ITEM7_P306_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P307_S0	(2) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits) recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_13_ITEM7_P307_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM7_P307_S2	The table excludes $5.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We invest our investment portfolio mainly in high-quality fixed-income securities.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $321.4 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $0.2 million.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our European operations are subject to currency risk related to the euro.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited Morningstar, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Morningstar, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing in Item 9A.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2012, and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries ( the Company ) for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for 2010 presented in Item 15(a).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audit.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2010, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Morningstar, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Morningstar, we, our), is a provider of independent investment research to investors around the world.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	We offer an extensive line of data, software, and research products for individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	We also offer asset management services for advisors, institutions, and retirement plan participants.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	In 2012, we identified errors related to purchases of investments and proceeds from maturities and sales of investments included on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2011 that had not been previously detected.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	We did not properly disclose the correct total in each category by equal, but offsetting, amounts.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	The financial statements have been corrected to increase the purchases of investments and proceeds from maturities and sales of investments as shown in the table below.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P15_S3	The error existed in the first quarter of 2012, but does not exist in the cumulative statement as of and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	The following table shows our previously reported amounts, the correction, and our as corrected amounts:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	We conduct our business operations through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest have been consolidated.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P17_S3	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interests in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributed to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Through our Investment Management segment (see Note 5 , Segment and Geographical Area Information), we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P21_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	In accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, we present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in two separate but consecutive statements, our Consolidated Statements of Income and separately, our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	We no longer present total comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statement of Equity.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	We state at fair value the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds, which are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of fixed-income securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs as described below:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 6 in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments , permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	FASB ASC 825 allows the fair value option to be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis when the asset or liability is initially recognized or when there's an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	We do not apply this fair value option to any of our eligible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	Capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service yet are included in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S3	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their full fair values as of the date control is obtained, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S4	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P45_S5	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations on the acquisition date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and values applicable for income tax purposes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions and divestitures.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2011, we altered the definition of our reporting units to align with the definition of our operating segments.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	This realignment occurred because of our successful efforts to integrate acquired businesses and leverage proprietary content across multiple products.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	As a result, the businesses that previously represented components of our operating segments no longer met the criteria for recognition as reporting units.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Our reporting units constitute businesses for which discrete financial information, which is regularly reviewed by management, is available.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2012, 2011, and 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement-Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	We recorded an impairment loss of approximately $800,000 in 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	We did not record any impairment losses in 2012 or 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	The impairment charge is included in our amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Revenue Recognition : We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Effective January 1, 2011, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	ASU 2009-13 superseded EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue-generating activities, addresses how to separate deliverables, and specifies how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	We applied this guidance for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified from January 1, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not significantly affect either the timing or amount of our revenue recognition.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite for recognition of revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Equity Research, Premium Membership fees for Morningstar.com, our structured credit research and ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	For new-issue ratings and analysis for CMBS, we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance of the transaction.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Investment Advisory Services includes a broad range of services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	Pricing for the consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service required, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P60_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Our Retirement Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	For our Retirement Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P61_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The revenue arrangements for Retirement Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements with our customers combine multiple products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided, which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units and restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	For stock options granted in 2011, we estimated the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P70_S4	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, in general, Morningstar's full-time employees are eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P72_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements, and also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding primarily reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Beginning in 2010, we further compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	In May 2010, we issued restricted stock in conjunction with the acquisition of Realpoint, LLC (now Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Because the restricted stock contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends, it meets the criteria of a participating security.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following table shows the number of weighted average stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share from both continuing operations and net earnings because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	These stock options and restricted stock units could be included in the calculation in the future.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Investment Information segment includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	These products are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The largest products in this segment based on revenue are Morningstar Data (formerly Licensed Data), Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar.com, Morningstar Integrated Web Tools, and Morningstar Principia.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Morningstar Data is a set of investment data spanning all of our investment databases, including real-time pricing and commodity data, and is available through electronic data feeds.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	Advisor Workstation is available in two editions: Morningstar Office for independent financial advisors and an enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Investment Information segment also includes Morningstar Credit Research and Morningstar Structured Credit Ratings.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The latter is provided by Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization specializing in structured finance.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	It offers securities ratings, research, surveillance services, and data to help institutional investors identify risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	We also offer a variety of financial communications and newsletters, other institutional and advisor software, and investment indexes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Investment Management segment includes all of our asset management operations, which earn the majority of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	The key products and services in this segment based on revenue are Investment Advisory Services (formerly Investment Consulting), which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds, including mutual funds and variable annuities; Retirement Solutions, including the Morningstar Retirement Manager and Advice by Ibbotson platforms; and Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons and risk levels that financial advisors can use for their clients' taxable and tax-deferred accounts.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	In addition, we offer Managed Portfolios through our subsidiary Ibbotson Australia which provides asset management services primarily to institutional clients and individual investors.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	Our segment accounting policies are the same as those described in Note 3 , except for the capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	We exclude these items from our operating segment results to provide our chief operating decision maker with a better indication of each segment s ability to generate cash flow.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	This information is one of the criteria used by our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources to each segment.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	We include capitalization and amortization of internal product development costs, amortization of intangible assets, and costs related to corporate functions in the Corporate Items category.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S4	Our segment disclosures are consistent with the business segment information provided to our chief operating decision maker on a recurring basis; for that reason, we don t present balance sheet information by segment.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P98_S5	We disclose goodwill by segment in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 350-20-50, Intangibles - Goodwill - Disclosure.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following tables present information about our operating segments:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Information by geographical region is as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	We classify our investments in three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	We monitor the concentration, diversification, maturity, and liquidity of our investment portfolio, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities, and classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , held-to-maturity investments included a $1,500,000 and a $1,600,000 certificate of deposit, respectively, held primarily as collateral against bank guarantees for our office leases, primarily in Australia.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	The fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements and that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the fair value hierarchy and the necessary disclosures under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , are as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting these investment categories each in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	There were no transfers between levels one and two during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, equity securities, and exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from observable market data.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 and 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Aegis Equities Research, a provider of independent equity research in Australia, for $10,269,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 1, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P118_S2	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	The allocation includes $5,801,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	Goodwill of $5,117,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefits of creating a larger analyst team that will enable us to expand our coverage of Australian-listed companies, provide Australian clients with more robust independent research, and give us the potential to expand our services in multiple delivery channels.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P120_S2	Approximately $1,787,000 of the intangible assets is deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately three years from the acquisition date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Old Broad Street Research Ltd. (OBSR) for $17,937,000 in cash, net of cash acquired.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	OBSR is a provider of fund research, ratings, and investment consulting services in the United Kingdom and offers an array of customized consulting services including model portfolios, advice on fund construction, and corporate governance services that are used by many of the leading financial advisers and fund platforms.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P121_S2	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 12, 2010.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	The allocation includes $9,266,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	Goodwill of $12,422,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the strategic benefit of adding to our existing fund research team in London and continuing to build our thought leadership in investment research.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	OBSR will also help us expand our investment consulting presence in the United Kingdom, where we already provide asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction services to institutions and intermediaries.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	The deferred tax liability of $2,317,000 is primarily because the amortization expense related to intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	In May 2010, we acquired Realpoint, LLC (Realpoint), a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	Realpoint offers securities ratings, research, surveillance services, and data to help institutional investors identify credit risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	Institutional investment firms subscribe to Realpoint's ratings and analytics, including money managers who invest in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 3, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P126_S4	In 2011, we renamed Realpoint as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	In conjunction with this acquisition, we paid $38,327,000 in cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements and in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations , we account for these grants as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P127_S2	See Note 12 for additional information concerning the accounting for this restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	The allocation includes $19,120,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Goodwill of $24,903,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity for Morningstar to enter the structured finance ratings and analysis business.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	The value assigned to goodwill, intangible assets, and restricted stock at the date of grant are deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	In July 2010, we acquired an additional 75% interest in Morningstar Danmark A/S (Morningstar Denmark), increasing our ownership to 100% from 25% .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	Morningstar Denmark's main offering is the investment information website for individual investors, Morningstar.dk, which provides fund and ETF data, portfolio tools, and market analysis.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on July 1, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	Morningstar Denmark's total estimated fair value of $20,192,000 includes $15,467,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 75% interest in Morningstar Denmark and $4,725,000 related to the 25% of Morningstar Denmark we previously held.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 25% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest and recorded a non-cash holding gain of $4,564,000 .

1289419_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	The allocation includes $9,854,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $2,504,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	Goodwill of $12,342,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer Morningstar's full suite of products and services to investors in Denmark and further leveraging Morningstar's global reach, investment databases, and technology expertise.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	In November 2010, we acquired the annuity intelligence business of Advanced Sales and Marketing Corporation (ASMC) for $14,113,000 in cash.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	The acquisition includes the Annuity Intelligence Report (AI Report), a web-based service that helps broker-dealers, insurers, and the financial professionals they support better understand and more effectively present variable annuity products to their clients.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P138_S2	The AI Report service leverages a proprietary database of more than 1,000 variable annuities that includes plain-English translations of complex but important information found in prospectuses and other public filings.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P138_S3	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on November 1, 2010.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	The goodwill value of $9,028,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to combine Morningstar's strength in variable annuity subaccount data and modeling tools with AI Report's product-level data and proprietary methodologies.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	The value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets are deductible for income tax purposes over a period of approximately 15 years from the acquisition date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	We also completed two other acquisitions in 2010:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	Footnoted business of Financial Fineprint Inc.:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	In February 2010, we acquired the Footnoted business of Financial Fineprint Inc. (Footnoted), a blog for professional money managers, analysts, and individual investors.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	In July 2010, we acquired Seeds Group (Seeds), a leading provider of investment consulting services and fund research in France.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their expected economic useful lives.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	Based on acquisitions and divestitures completed through December 31, 2012 , we expect intangible amortization expense for 2013 and subsequent years as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful life, and currency translations.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	We have not reclassified the operating results of these businesses, included as part of our Investment Information segment, to discontinued operations, nor have we reclassified the related assets and liabilities to held for disposition, because these amounts are not significant to our consolidated statements or segment disclosures.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	In 2010, we recorded changes to our liability for vacant office space, primarily for the former Ibbotson headquarters.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	We increased the liability related to this vacant office space because we anticipated receiving lower sublease income and expected it would take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P179_S2	In addition, we increased our liability for vacant office space related to the equity research and data business acquired from CPMS.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	We include our liability for vacant office space in "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities", as appropriate, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	Our shareholders approved the Morningstar 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) on May 17, 2011.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	As of that date we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	The 2004 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Morningstar 2000 Stock Option Plan, and the Morningstar 2001 Stock Option Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	The 2011 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including, among other things, stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	We granted stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock under the 2004 Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P183_S3	Any shares subject to awards under the 2011 Plan, but not under the 2004 Plan, that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2012 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P186_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P187_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P187_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P187_S3	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P188_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	In conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition in May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements prepared in conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition, we account for the grant of restricted shares as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	See Note 7 , in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information concerning the Realpoint acquisition.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	We measured the fair value of the restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P192_S1	We amortize the fair value of $9,363,000 to stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P192_S2	The stock-based compensation expense recorded in 2012 and 2011 includes approximately $3,238,000 and $396,000 , respectively, of expense recognized upon the accelerated vesting of restricted stock.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P192_S3	We have assumed that all of the remaining restricted stock will ultimately vest, and therefore we have not incorporated a forfeiture rate for purposes of determining the stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P193_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P193_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	Almost all of the outstanding options granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan have a premium price feature in which the exercise price increases over the term of the option at a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield as of the date of grant.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	Options granted under the 2011 Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P195_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P195_S2	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P195_S3	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2012 :
1289419_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $62.83 on that date.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return that exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Statement of Income.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P200_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P201_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P201_S1	In 2012 and 2011, we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P201_S2	In 2010, we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P203_S0	The following table presents the components of our net non-operating income:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P204_S0	Interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P204_S1	Interest income in 2012 includes approximately $700,000 of interest income related to the $1,000,000 of business tax refund for prior years recorded in 2012, as discussed above in the section, Consolidated Results.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P204_S2	In 2011, interest expense of $1,318,000 included approximately $900,000 related to the $1,400,000 of business tax expense for prior years recorded in the second quarter of 2011, as discussed above in the section, Consolidated Results .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P205_S0	In 2012, other income (expense), net included the loss on the sale of our investment in Bundle Corporation of $2,034,000 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P205_S1	See Note 9 for additional information concerning our investment in Bundle Corporation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P206_S0	In 2010, this category included the holding gain of $4,564,000 resulting from the difference between the estimated fair value and the book value of our investment in Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P206_S1	See Note 7 for additional information concerning Morningstar Denmark.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	Other income (expense), net also includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio, gains and losses on sale of fixed assets, and royalty income from MJKK.

1289419_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P212_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	Our U.S. federal NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2012 of $2,362,000 is subject to limitations on the use of the NOL imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and therefore is limited to approximately $225,000 per year.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	The increase in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflects additional NOL carryforwards in our non-U.S. operations as well as the impact of currency translations.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $95,100,000 as of December 31, 2012 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P218_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P219_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $4,031,000 of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P220_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P220_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P220_S3	In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally extends to years prior to 2005.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P221_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	It is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $6,568,000 and a non-current liability of $5,659,000 for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P223_S1	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P224_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P225_S0	In 2012 , we recorded a net increase of $1,299,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $875,000 increased our income tax expense by $702,000 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P225_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $790,000 for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $207,000 decreased our income tax expense by $207,000 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P226_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we had $12,699,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $12,699,000 , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $10,446,000 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P227_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P227_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_13_ITEM8_P228_S0	We recorded the increase in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2012 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P229_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P229_S1	The plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P230_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P231_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P231_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P231_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P231_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P232_S0	Morningstar is aware of 14 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P233_S0	In November 2011, Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the Klass Matter.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P234_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P234_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the Klass Matter.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P235_S0	In April 2012, the Receiver filed a complaint against Morningstar, in which the Receiver claims that Morningstar is liable for contribution and aiding and abetting Stinson's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P235_S1	The same day the Receiver filed his complaint, Morningstar sought leave from the court to file a counter suit against Stinson and two of his entities-Keystone State Capital Corporation and LG-for, among other things, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of user agreements.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P235_S2	In June 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion for leave to file suit.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P235_S3	The court took no position on the merits of Morningstar's claims, and did not preclude Morningstar from renewing its motion to file a complaint at a later time, but deferred to the Receiver's request not to subject the receivership estate to additional litigation at this early point in the receivership.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P235_S4	In August 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion to dismiss the Receiver's complaint.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P236_S0	Morningstar believes the allegations against it by the Klass plaintiffs and the Receiver have no legal or factual basis and plans to vigorously contest the claims.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P236_S1	Morningstar also intends to refile its affirmative claims against Stinson, Keystone, and LG at a later time consistent with the court's order.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P237_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P238_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P238_S1	Business Logic is alleging breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation in connection with Ibbotson's development of a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P238_S2	Business Logic seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P238_S3	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P239_S0	While Morningstar and Ibbotson are vigorously contesting the claims against them, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P240_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with the matters described above because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P241_S0	In June 2010, Egan-Jones Rating Co. filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC) and Morningstar, Inc. in connection with a December 2007 agreement between Egan-Jones and Morningstar Credit Ratings for certain data-sharing and other services.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P241_S1	In addition to damages, Egan-Jones filed a petition seeking an injunction to temporarily prevent Morningstar from offering corporate credit ratings through December 31, 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P241_S2	In September 2010, the court denied Egan-Jones's request for a preliminary injunction against Morningstar's corporate credit ratings business.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P241_S3	In December 2012, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar, and Egan Jones entered into a settlement agreement resolving the litigation.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P242_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P242_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S0	In September 2010, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $100 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S1	In December 2011, the board approved an increase to the $100 million share repurchase program it announced in 2010.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S2	The board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S3	In December 2012, the board approval authorized the company to repurchase an additional $200 million , increasing the repurchase program from $300 million to $500 million .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S4	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P243_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , we had repurchased a total of 5,056,595 shares for $300,936,000 under this authorization.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P244_S0	In February 2013 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P244_S1	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2013 to shareholders of record as of April 12, 2013 .
1289419_13_ITEM8_P245_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-2, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220).
1289419_13_ITEM8_P245_S1	The amended guidance requires us to show the effects of items reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where net income is presented.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P245_S2	For Morningstar, the ASU No. 2013-2 is effective on January 1, 2013.
1289419_13_ITEM8_P246_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2013-2 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We maintain a series of comprehensive databases on many types of investments, focusing on investment vehicles that are widely used by investors globally.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	After building these databases, we add value and insight to the data by applying our core skills of research, technology, and design.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	As part of our research efforts on individual stocks, we popularized the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett, and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We currently provide ratings on about 600 issuers and also provide research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	In 2012, we began publishing analyst research on municipal bonds.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our fundamental municipal research is designed to assess relative credit quality and fiscal distress using a proprietary, analyst-driven methodology.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	We've also developed in-depth advice on security selection and portfolio construction to meet the needs of investors and professionals looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe many investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our strategy is to widen our economic moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, and build shareholder value by focusing on our three key objectives, which we describe in more detail below.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Develop the next-generation software for our investment research platforms, which will offer the most elegant and intuitive user experience for our customers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our customers technology needs are rapidly evolving, and our clients increasingly want integrated solutions as opposed to using different research tools for different parts of their portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	To meet this, we re rebuilding our core software architecture to accelerate delivery of our products, allow us to innovate more rapidly, and drive rich web-based user experiences for our clients.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	We're currently building the next-generation software architecture that will eventually underlie most of our software products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	The new software architecture uses an underlying framework that allows us to create capabilities or tools that take our software to a much higher design standard that s more intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use and helps ensure a more consistent, cohesive signature Morningstar user experience.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	It also has several technological advantages, including a more streamlined design and development process for commonly used Morningstar capabilities such as portfolio management tools and a more consistent user experience across Morningstar's platforms.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The new software architecture will also address the growing need for mobile-optimized capabilities to extend the desktop experience onto mobile devices, as well as clients increasing preference for cloud-based deployment, which eliminates the need for desktop software installations and allows immediate access to new features.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The new software framework will be easier for clients to implement and configure through seamless programming interfaces and web services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	It will also allow us to innovate more rapidly and more easily configure our software solutions to meet client needs.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	We plan to introduce this new architecture as part of Morningstar Direct in 2014, beginning with new versions of many of our core capabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Over time, we expect the majority of our software solutions to use this single technology architecture.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	By moving all of our core research products to a common software architecture, we'll be able to leverage our development resources, give our customers a more unified and consistent Morningstar experience, and better showcase our innovative research and analytical tools.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Deliver the most effective investment data, research, and ratings to help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe that our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our goal is to continue producing insights that empower investors and focus our research efforts in three major areas:
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Extend leadership position in global fund research .
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	In recent years, we have expanded our analyst coverage outside of the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	We've built an integrated team of locally based fund experts to expand our research coverage in additional markets around the world.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we had 105 fund analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	We currently produce qualitative analyst research and Morningstar Analyst Ratings on about 4,000 funds around the world.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	We plan to continue expanding the number of funds that have Morningstar Analyst Ratings and in-depth qualitative research reports.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Continue leveraging our capabilities in stocks.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our equity research complements our approach to mutual fund analysis, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund's portfolio.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we provided analyst research on about 1,600 companies globally.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	We also provide quantitative ratings and reports for approximately 28,000 companies globally.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We're committed to maintaining the broad, high-quality coverage we've become known for as one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We're working to expand distribution of our equity research through a variety of channels, including financial advisors, institutional investment firms, and companies outside of the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We believe that investors' increasing awareness of the value of independent research will strengthen our business over the long term.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	We've also expanded our proprietary stock database, which we view as an important complement to our analyst research.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Build business in credit research and ratings.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	We began publishing research and ratings on corporate credit issuers in 2009 and currently produce research and ratings on about 600 corporate credit issuers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	In 2012, we began publishing research on more than 100 municipal bond issuers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	We view credit ratings as a natural extension of the equity research we've been producing for the past decade.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S4	We believe we have a unique viewpoint to offer on company default risk that leverages our cash-flow modeling expertise, proprietary measures like economic moat, and in-depth knowledge of the companies and industries we cover.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P24_S5	In 2013, we also published research reports analyzing pension plan assets and liabilities for pension plans administered by all 50 states and 25 major cities.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We're including this research on our software platforms to provide investors with an additional perspective on fixed-income investments.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	We also plan to monetize the ratings through enterprise licenses and subscriptions to our institutional equity research clients, who have access to the forecasts, models, and scores underlying the ratings.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	We also offer fixed-income capabilities through Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that specializes in research and ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We believe investors are looking for better research on these securities and that we're well-positioned to meet this need.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	B e a world-class investment management organization based on our proprietary research.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe assembling and evaluating multimanager portfolios is a natural extension of our expertise in understanding managed investment products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our investment advisory programs combine managed investment vehicles typically mutual funds in portfolios designed to help investors meet their financial goals.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	When we create portfolios made up of other funds, our goal is to simplify the investment process and help investors access portfolios that match their level of risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term investment objectives.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	We draw on our extensive experience analyzing funds and combine quantitative research with a qualitative assessment of manager skill and investment style.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P28_S4	We had a total of $83.5 billion in assets under advisement in our Investment Advisory business as of December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our advisory business focuses on relationships and agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager or asset allocation program designer for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis-point fee.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We plan to further develop this business by expanding outside of the United States, building our capabilities in areas such as alternative investment strategies, developing more ways to incorporate risk protection and insurance, reaching additional client segments, and focusing on performance and client support.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	We also offer managed retirement account services through our Retirement Solutions platform and had $31.7 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts as of December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We offer these services for retirement plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to our managed retirement programs, which are based on quantitative systems that select investment options and make retirement planning choices for the participants.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	We believe retirement plan participants will continue to adopt managed accounts because of the complexity involved in retirement planning.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Morningstar Managed Portfolios is a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2013, there were $7.3 billion in assets under management and advisement in Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Given the core capabilities discussed above, we're focusing on four primary customer groups:
1289419_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We describe each of these four customer groups in the section below.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	This customer group includes several different types of advisors, including independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker-dealers, dually registered advisors, and captive advisors who are employees of a broker-dealer.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Captive broker-dealers include wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, and banks.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	Cerulli Associates estimates there were approximately 300,000 financial advisors in the United States as of the end of 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	There has also been an industry-wide shift in favor of fee-based planning, as opposed to commission models.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	We add value by helping advisors make more efficient use of their time and deliver better investment outcomes for their clients.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We also offer a comprehensive and integrated set of solutions, including proprietary investment methodologies, portfolio- and security-level research, and investment management.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	We believe our products and tools are deeply embedded in many portions of financial advisors daily workflow.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	To build this business, we plan to focus on helping advisors with a broad range of tasks, including investment decision-making, new client acquisition, client monitoring and reporting, and practice management.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	We're expanding our mobile solutions to reach advisors wherever they are including at a desktop, on a mobile device, participating in social networking sites, or attending conferences and events.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	We plan to build comprehensive advisory solutions that incorporate both retirement and non-retirement assets and continue expanding our reach with both independent advisors and those affiliated with larger firms.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our main products for financial advisors are Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and Principia.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Asset management firms create, market, and distribute investment portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	We estimate that there are approximately 2,700 asset management firms globally, ranging from large, global firms that each manage more than $1 trillion to firms with small fund lineups and operations in a single market or region.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, and distribution, as well as investment management (the buy side ), which includes portfolio management, research, and securities analysis.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our asset management offerings help companies connect with investors by applying Morningstar s intellectual capital and brand to reinforce the value propositions of their own financial products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	We offer a global reach and have earned investors trust in our unbiased approach, investor-centric mission, thought leadership, and expertise in data and investment management.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our strategy for the asset management customer group includes expanding the range of services we offer, driving our thought leadership, helping clients adapt to regulatory change, and tailoring our offerings to meet the needs of asset management firms of various sizes.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	We also plan to expand our offerings to meet the growing need for research, data, and tools related to ETFs and other passively managed portfolios, as well as enhancing our derivatives coverage and capabilities to help investors better analyze and understand the rapidly increasing universe of alternative investments.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	For the buy side, we provide award-winning equity and credit research for active fundamental portfolio managers who want actionable, unbiased ideas that improve performance.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	For the buy side, key products include Morningstar Equity and Credit Research, Structured Credit Research and Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	In the retirement market, millions of investors are now charged with planning for their own retirement, as more companies have shifted from traditional pension plans to self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k) plans.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Total assets in 401(k) plans have increased to $4.0 trillion as of September 30, 2013 based on data from the Investment Company Institute.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, we believe individual investors, financial advisors, employers, and government organizations have all become more aware of the need for advice and guidance that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our retirement offerings help retirement plan participants of all ages plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We currently reach approximately 24 million plan participants through approximately 237,000 plan sponsors and 26 plan providers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	We help plan providers manage their risk and costs while differentiating themselves in an increasingly competitive market.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our major products for the retirement customer group are Retirement Solutions, Investment Advisory services, and Investment Profiles.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	While the number of individual investors in the United States has declined from peak levels, Gallup s annual Economics and Personal Finance Survey released in May 2013 found that approximately 52% of individuals in the United States invest in the stock market either directly or through mutual funds or self-directed retirement plans.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	On a global basis, McKinsey Global Institute estimates that households own approximately $85.2 trillion in financial assets, with approximately 28.1% invested in equities and 71.9% in other investments including cash, money-market funds, and fixed-income securities.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Because many individual investors trust Morningstar s research and tools, our extensive reach with individual investors also drives demand for our other customer groups.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Since our founding in 1984, we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and expanding our existing offerings.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	From 2006 through 2010, we also completed 24 acquisitions to support our growth objectives (as detailed above).

1289419_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Pricing for Retirement Solutions depends on several different factors, including the level of services offered (including whether or not such services cause us to be an ERISA fiduciary), the number of participants, the level of systems integration required, and the availability of competing products.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	Each company is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its country and working with Morningstar's data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases, develop new products, and enhance existing products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to our business operations outside of the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	We try to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P121_S2	For example, in the normal course of business, we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P121_S3	We use these agreements to define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we maintain operating companies.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	As we move into new countries, we consider adding to these registrations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P122_S2	We have registered the Morningstar name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in various other countries.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P122_S3	In some jurisdictions, we also register certain product names.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are registered marks of Morningstar in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P123_S1	The table below includes some of the trademarks and service marks that we use:
1289419_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States and Canada.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	We believe these patents represent our commitment to developing innovative products and tools for investors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	We license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with all of our operating companies.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to market our products and develop and sell country-specific variants of products under the Morningstar name in their operating territories.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and obtaining it directly from public filings.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as our Financial Communications materials and our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P128_S2	We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P128_S3	This tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P129_S1	The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	In 2013, our largest customer accounted for less than 2% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	The economic and financial information industry has been marked by increased consolidation over the past several years, with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	Some of our major competitors include Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Financial; and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P131_S2	These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P131_S3	We also have a number of smaller competitors, which we discuss in Major Products and Services above.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	We have a flexible technology platform that allows our products to work together across a full range of investment databases, delivery formats, and market segments.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P133_S3	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P133_S4	This allows us to control our development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	As of December 31, 2013, our technology team consisted of approximately 900 programmers and technology and infrastructure professionals.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	Investment advisory and broker-dealer businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the United States at both the federal and state level, as well as by self-regulatory organizations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	Financial services companies are among the nation's most extensively regulated.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for enforcing the federal securities laws and oversees federally registered investment advisors and broker-dealers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	As of December 31, 2013, three of our subsidiaries, Ibbotson Associates, Inc., Morningstar Associates, LLC, and Morningstar Investment Services, Inc. are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P137_S2	Such requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	As registered investment advisors, all three subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.

1289419_14_ITEM1_P178_S0	We maintain a website at http://corporate.morningstar.com .
1289419_14_ITEM1_P178_S1	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P178_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P178_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P178_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P179_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P179_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P179_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P180_S0	Our investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P181_S0	Three of our subsidiaries, Ibbotson Associates, Inc., Morningstar Associates, LLC, and Morningstar Investment Services, Inc. are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P181_S1	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P181_S2	Such requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P182_S0	As registered investment advisors, all three subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P183_S0	In addition, because these three subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P183_S1	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P183_S2	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P184_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P185_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P185_S1	In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P185_S2	As part of this service, we can construct and monitor the investment lineup, document our investment process, create an Investment Policy Statement, and furnish the plan with detailed quarterly investment and performance reports.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P185_S3	We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P185_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had $31.7 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P186_S0	We rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P187_S0	The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P187_S1	We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P187_S2	Problems could arise if these programs assigned retirement plan participants to the wrong portfolios, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P188_S0	We may not be able to prevent clients from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P188_S1	If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P188_S2	We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P189_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P189_S1	In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on nearly $160 billion in assets as of December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P189_S2	We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P190_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 29 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S1	We believe these proprietary tools continue to provide us with a competitive advantage, but if tools similar to them become available through other channels, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S2	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S3	We believe lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S4	Smaller companies may be able to introduce new research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S5	If we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools at the same rate as in the past, we may not generate enough enthusiasm with potential clients to win new business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P191_S6	We cannot guarantee that we will continue to successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P192_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S2	Examples include the shift from local network to computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S3	We are in the process of building the next-generation software architecture that will eventually underlie of our investment research platforms, but we have not yet incorporated this software in our products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S4	While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S5	We believe our history of rapid technological innovation and expertise in technology have historically given us a competitive advantage.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S6	As mentioned above, though, we believe that lower technology costs and growth in open software platforms have lowered barriers to entry for new competitors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S7	Our competitors may also be able to introduce new technology more rapidly than we are to meet changing market needs.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P193_S8	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P194_S0	An outage of our database and network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, much of which is geographically concentrated in our Chicago headquarters and other backup locations in the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S4	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S5	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S6	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures or disruptions, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P195_S7	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P196_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our headquarters.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P196_S1	There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P196_S2	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P196_S3	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P197_S0	Our business relies heavily on electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P197_S1	Any failures or disruptions could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P198_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P198_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P198_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P199_S0	We could face liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of some of our currently pending litigation.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P200_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P200_S1	These include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical in the asset management and financial information businesses in which we operate.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P201_S0	We are currently defendants in two cases that we describe in Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P201_S1	The plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts of damages.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P202_S0	Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of any particular proceeding can never be predicted with certainty.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P202_S1	An adverse litigation outcome could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P203_S0	In addition to its potential financial impact, litigation can have a significant adverse reputational impact.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P203_S1	We depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P203_S2	Allegations of improper conduct made by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P204_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about our users.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S0	Customers routinely enter personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S1	We also handle an increasing volume of personally sensitive information through our Portfolio Management Service, Enterprise Data Management, managed retirement accounts, and other areas of our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S2	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S3	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S4	We may suffer malicious attacks seeking to penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P205_S5	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, portfolio holdings, or credit card information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P206_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may adversely impact our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S0	We believe ongoing economic weakness continues to cause uncertainty and pressure on consumer discretionary spending.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S1	The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as well as more recent financial and economic uncertainty, has led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies, which make up a large percentage of our client base.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S2	Some institutional clients have also implemented additional review processes for new contracts or began to provide certain services, particularly investment advisory services, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S4	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market in recent years, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P207_S5	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P208_S0	In 2010 and 2011, rising government debt levels around the world as well as downgrades in sovereign debt issues for some European countries led to market fears about a potential crisis in global sovereign debt.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P208_S1	Some European countries have been unable to successfully refinance their debts, leading European finance officials to take measures during 2010 and 2011 to stabilize financial conditions across Europe.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P208_S2	While conditions in Europe have improved, many European countries have continued to experience weak economic growth.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P208_S3	In addition, many companies in the financial services industry have been subject to increasing government regulation, which may increase their operating costs and cause them to reduce spending in other areas.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P209_S0	In addition, if financial markets around the world experience negative performance and volatility, demand for our products and services may decline, and our revenue, operating income, and other financial results could suffer.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P209_S1	Our business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P209_S2	Our structured credit rating business is subject to volatility from trends in new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P209_S3	The financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, that are beyond our control.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P210_S0	Our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines as well as the effect of cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P211_S0	In 2013, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 13% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P211_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P211_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P211_S3	The size of these portfolios can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P211_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P212_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P212_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S0	We believe that independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S1	We offer products and services to our institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S2	Our institutional clients have generated a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue in recent years.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S3	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S4	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P213_S5	The fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services, as well as the fact that in some cases we make investment recommendations within the framework of client constraints, may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P214_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P214_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P215_S0	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us (either intentionally or inadvertently) could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P216_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P217_S0	Changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations, compliance failures, or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S0	Our investment advisory operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are primarily subject to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P218_S5	If we fail to establish required licenses or regulatory approvals for our investment advisory operations, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P219_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P219_S1	We began publishing credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers in 2009.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P220_S0	Although our corporate credit rating business is not currently regulated as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P220_S1	We cannot predict the future impact of potential future regulatory changes on our corporate credit rating business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P221_S0	We also expanded our credit rating business operations with our May 2010 acquisition of Realpoint, LLC (now known as Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC), an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P222_S0	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P223_S0	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examination by the SEC.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P224_S0	It is difficult to predict the future effect of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P224_S1	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P224_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory or credit rating services in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P225_S0	Competition could reduce our share of the investment research market and hurt our financial performance.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P226_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment research providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors, and institutional clients.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P226_S1	We compete with many different types of companies that vary in size, product scope, and media focus, including large and well-established distributors of financial information, such as Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Financial; and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P226_S2	We compete with a variety of other companies in different areas of our business, which we discuss in greater detail in the Major Products and Services section in Item 1 Business.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P227_S0	Many of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P227_S1	This may allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for products and services, devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services, and make more attractive offers to potential clients, subscribers, and strategic partners.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P227_S2	They may also be able to offer better customer service and support.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P227_S3	Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P227_S4	Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P228_S0	The investment information industry is dominated by a few large players, and industry consolidation has increased in the past several years.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P228_S1	If providers of data and investment analysis continue to consolidate, our competitive position may suffer.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P229_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P230_S0	We generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P231_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P231_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P231_S2	Based on Morningstar's estimates for U.S. mutual fund asset flows, long-term open-end funds had positive net inflows of approximately $270 billion in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P232_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P232_S1	In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P233_S0	Over the past several years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P233_S1	This trend continued in 2013, as passively managed vehicles (both mutual funds and ETFs) had about $300 billion in net inflows, compared with $150 billion of net inflows for active products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P233_S2	Overall, we estimate that passively managed assets now account for more than one-fourth of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P234_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P234_S1	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P235_S0	Our operations outside of the United States are expanding and involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P236_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $197.5 million in revenue in 2013, or about 28% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P236_S1	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P236_S2	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P237_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P237_S1	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P237_S2	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P237_S3	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, our financial results are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P238_S0	The concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative effect on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P239_S0	We now have approximately 900 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fourth of our total workforce.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P240_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, we cannot predict the level of political and regulatory risk that may affect our operations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P240_S1	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P240_S2	Any difficulties that we face in successfully maintaining our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide, particularly because we rely on employees in this facility to maintain and update our mutual fund database.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P241_S0	We have approximately 360 employees who work at our data collection facility in Mumbai, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_14_ITEM1_P241_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P242_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P243_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on corporate credit issuers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P243_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P243_S2	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P244_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P244_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P244_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P244_S3	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P245_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P246_S0	We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P246_S1	These organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P246_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P247_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P247_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P247_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P247_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P247_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P248_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P249_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P249_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P249_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers, or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P249_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P250_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P250_S1	It is possible that our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P250_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P250_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P251_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P252_S0	As of December 31, 2013, Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P252_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P252_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P252_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P253_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S2	A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs, office leases, and other infrastructure spending, which generally cannot be adjusted quickly.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S3	Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S4	If actual revenue falls below our expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S5	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S6	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P254_S7	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P255_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P256_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P256_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P256_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P256_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P256_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P257_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P258_S0	In the past, we've granted options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P258_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P258_S2	As of December 31, 2013, our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 433,531 shares of common stock, 399,008 of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $27.91 per share.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P258_S3	As of December 31, 2013, there were 696,684 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 33 months.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P259_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P259_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and we issue shares with the vesting of restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P259_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P260_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P260_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P261_S0	Stock option exercises, share repurchases, and other factors may create volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P262_S0	Part of our cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P262_S1	Excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised if the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise) exceeds the fair value of the option at the time of grant.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P262_S2	Similarly, excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock at vesting is greater than the grant price of the restricted stock units.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P262_S3	These excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P263_S0	It is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be realized.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P263_S1	Because of this uncertainty, there may be additional volatility in our cash flows from financing activities.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P264_S0	In addition, our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to $700 million of our outstanding common stock, of which approximately $230 million remains available for future repurchases as of February 21, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P264_S1	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that management deems appropriate.
1289419_14_ITEM1_P264_S2	Changes in the amount of repurchase activity from period to period may also cause volatility in our cash flows.
1289419_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we leased approximately 334,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our office located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 357,000 square feet of office space in 26 other countries around the world, including 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	Morningstar is aware of 14 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	In November 2011, Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the Klass Matter.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the Klass Matter.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P6_S0	In April 2012, the Receiver filed a complaint against Morningstar, in which the Receiver claims that Morningstar is liable for contribution and aiding and abetting Stinson's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P6_S1	The same day the Receiver filed his complaint, Morningstar sought leave from the court to file a counter suit against Stinson and two of his entities-Keystone State Capital Corporation and LG for, among other things, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of user agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P6_S2	In June 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion for leave to file suit.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P6_S3	The court took no position on the merits of Morningstar's claims, and did not preclude us from renewing our motion to file a complaint at a later time, but deferred to the Receiver's request not to subject the receivership estate to additional litigation at this early point in the receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P7_S0	A bench trial related to the Receiver s claims against Morningstar was held between January 13 and January 28, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P8_S0	At trial, the Receiver claimed that Morningstar is liable under a contribution theory for all or part of a $14.5 million disgorgement judgment that the SEC obtained against the entities and individuals in receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P8_S1	Morningstar contested liability and damages at trial and believes it is not liable for any amount.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P8_S2	The parties will file post-trial proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in early March 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P8_S3	It is not known when the court will issue its decision.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P9_S0	We believe the allegations against Morningstar by the Klass plaintiffs and the Receiver have no legal or factual basis and we plan to continue to vigorously contest the claims.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P9_S1	We also intend to refile our affirmative claims against Stinson, Keystone, and LG at a later time consistent with the court's order.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P10_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P11_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with this matter because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P12_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P12_S1	Business Logic is alleging breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation in connection with Ibbotson's development of a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P12_S2	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, also seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P12_S3	Business Logic filed a motion for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, which was denied on October 1, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P13_S0	Business Logic's complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P13_S1	With regard to compensatory damages, based on the analysis of Ibbotson's retained damages expert (who has assumed, solely for purposes of his analysis, that Business Logic will prevail with regard to the issue of liability), and recognizing the uncertainty inherent in litigation and our intention to continue to vigorously defend the claims made by Business Logic, our best estimate of the range of possible loss is between $0 and $5.4 million, excluding punitive damages or attorneys' fees, both of which are recoverable in certain circumstances under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P13_S2	Business Logic's retained damages expert (who has also assumed for purposes of her estimate that Business Logic will prevail with regard to the issue of liability) has, however, estimated compensatory damages of $84 million, excluding punitive damages or attorneys' fees.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P14_S0	We dispute the conclusions reached and the methods employed by Business Logic's expert.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P15_S0	With regard to Business Logic's claim for injunctive relief, no reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss is possible.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P16_S0	Morningstar and Ibbotson continue to vigorously contest all the claims against them in this matter.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P16_S1	We cannot, however, predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P17_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_14_ITEM3_P17_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 21, 2014, the last reported price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $83.15 per share, and there were 1,412 shareholders of record for our common stock.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table shows dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	We paid three dividends during 2013 as we opted to pay our January 2013 dividend in December 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 17.0 cents per share in 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2013 and during the three months ended December 31, 2013:
1289419_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	_________________________________________________ * Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) In September 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of the outstanding common stock with an expiration date of December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P9_S1	In December 2011, the board approved a $200 million increase to this program.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P9_S2	In December 2012, the board authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million in shares of our outstanding common stock and extended the expiration date of the program to December 31, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P9_S3	In December 2013, the board approved another $200 million increase in the program.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_14_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 15, 2014:
1289419_14_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter, the previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plans for Bevin Desmond and her spouse, Steve Kaplan, Richard Robbins, and David W. Williams completed or expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares each identified director and executive officer will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans identified above.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2013, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2014 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM5_P12_S3	Each director and executive officer identified in the table may amend or terminate his Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	Please see Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based compensation.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program and dividend payments.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	These cash outflows are offset by proceeds from stock-option exercises and excess tax benefits.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P3_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P4_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P4_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P4_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations, including the concentration of development work at our offshore facilities in China and India.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	In the third quarter of 2013, we revised our segment structure to reflect our shift to a more centralized organizational structure.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We now report our results in a single segment, which is consistent with how management allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We sell most of our investment information products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Equity Research, Retirement Solutions, and some of our structured credit research and ratings offerings, through license agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, Principia software, and newsletters, via subscriptions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	In our structured credit research and rating business, we generate transaction-based revenue for our ratings on new issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our investment management business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	The method of calculation varies by client; some contracts include provisions for calculating average assets based on daily data, while others use weekly or monthly data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	In our Retirement Solutions business, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our Retirement Solutions business also includes plan sponsor and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Advisory Services and Retirement Solutions businesses because our fee structures vary by client.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range would be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	We disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our SEC filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Fees for our mutual fund and ETF portfolios generally range from 20 to 40 basis points.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	We charge fees of 55 basis points for our customized stock portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result, we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $149.2 million at the end of 2013 and $146.0 million at the end of 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	We strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple customer groups, through multiple media, and in many geographical markets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	In general, our businesses have high fixed costs, and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our operating expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	We believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower, particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short-term operating results.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we are able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	When revenue decreases, however, the operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Cost of revenue also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases and data lines.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	We now include development expense in the cost of revenue category, which we previously referred to as cost of goods sold.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	We have reclassified development expense to include it in cost of revenue for all periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing programs to promote our products in this category.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	This category consists mainly of compensation expense for our management team, as well as corporate functions (including employees in our human resources, finance, and legal departments).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs, including corporate systems, finance and accounting, legal, compliance, and facilities expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our capital expenditures primarily consist of information technology equipment, leasehold improvements, and capitalized software development costs.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the United States and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We account for our minority-owned investments in Japan and Sweden using the equity method.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which represents the company's future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price, or to take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not be in the long-term interest of building shareholder value.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Organic revenue is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Free cash flow is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate a retention rate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We use two different methods for calculating retention.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	For subscription-based products (including our print newsletters, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and Principia software), we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P28_S6	The retention rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Despite a temporary government shutdown and periodic concerns about the Federal Reserve tapering off its efforts to stimulate the economy, the U.S. stock market showed unusually strong gains in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year up 33.1%.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Global markets also closed out the year with strong returns; Morningstar s Global Markets ex-U.S. Index posted a 16.1% gain for the year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fund industry enjoyed healthy growth in 2013 as a slowly improving global economy help lead to more positive investor sentiment.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Total U.S. mutual fund assets rose to $15.0 trillion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $13.0 trillion as of December 31, 2012, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Based on Morningstar s analysis of fund flow trends, equity mutual funds had estimated net inflows of about $220 billion in 2013, up from about $100 billion in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	In contrast to the past several years, when investors heavily favored bond funds, some fixed-income fund categories experienced net outflows as rising interest rates led to negative total returns.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	Global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	In 2013, passively managed vehicles had more than $300 billion in net inflows, compared with about $150 billion of net inflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The number of mutual funds in the United States rose slightly to about 7,700 in 2013 (excluding multiple share classes), compared with about 7,600 in 2012 based on ICI data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The number of global mutual funds rose to about 75,300 as of September 30, 2013, up from about 73,500 as of September 30, 2012, based on ICI data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2013 with about $1.7 trillion in assets under management based on ICI data, up from about $1.3 trillion at the end of 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Based on data from ComScore, aggregate page views to financial and investment sites rose about 9% in 2013, while the number of unique users was up about 11%.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The number of pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit increased by about 17% and 21%, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	We believe these trends reflect a higher level of interest in financial- and investment-related content among individual investors as the market rose during 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	For Morningstar.com, metrics such as unique users and aggregate page views were up slightly for the year, while pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit showed a more significant increase.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Amid these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies rose moderately in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Although Magna Global, a division of Interpublic Group, estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about 16% across all industries in 2013, we believe spending in the financial services industry rose at a more moderate pace.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new rules for financial services companies globally.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Many of these relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and an emphasis on "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Advisors are now required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	Financial advisors are also required to fully disclose and have clients agree on fees for advice and charge separately for any funds or investments.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	Beginning in April 2014, online investment platforms will also be required to charge separate fees for investors who make transactions through them and provide additional disclosures about the fees they charge.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the European Union, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is a set of directives designed to enable funds to operate across the region based upon authorization from one state regulator.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	UCITS IV, which came into effect in July 2011, included requirements for a new Key Investor Information Document (KIID), an easy-to-read annual factsheet that replaces the Simplified Prospectus.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Every UCITS fund that is promoted to retail investors is now required to produce a KIID and issue an updated copy each year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	We use our data and production capabilities to help fund companies produce and distribute these documents.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	In Australia, the government has introduced a series of Future of Financial Advice reforms.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Mandatory implementation of these reforms began in July 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Many of these related to fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) into law in July 2010.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Dodd-Frank creates a number of new regulatory, supervisory, and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of U.S. financial markets and activities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Dodd-Frank also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action, giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	As a result, the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	In 2013, various regulatory agencies approved provisions of the "Volcker Rule," which would prevent banks from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and more speculative investments.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Volcker Rule is scheduled to go into effect in April 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Dodd-Frank included a number of corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to publicly traded companies generally.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	It also included changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies granting the SEC more oversight over Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including our Morningstar Credit Ratings subsidiary.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	While we believe Dodd-Frank and related regulations will not have a significant effect on other areas of Morningstar, we continue to monitor the potential impact on our clients.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering rules that would impose a fiduciary standard for financial advisors, which would require them to act in the best interest of clients when making investment recommendations instead of the looser suitability standards currently in place.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Department of Labor has proposed a similar plan that would only apply to advisors working with defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	We believe the increase regulatory scrutiny of advisors may lead to an expanding need for independent advice, tools, and solutions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	In July 2013, the United States Department of Labor (DOL) revised the definition of "Rating Agency" in its amended requirements for the Exemption From Certain Prohibited Transaction Restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to eliminate any specific reference to a particular credit rating agency.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The amended exemption increases the ability of employee benefit plans to invest in structured credit securities that carry ratings issued by Morningstar Credit Ratings.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Despite generally positive market trends, we believe the business environment for the financial services industry remains challenging.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Asset management firms have been facing increasing regulatory burdens, which are leading to higher costs and more cautious spending in other areas.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Further, the historically low interest rate environment has put significant pressure on the margins of many firms, most notably those in the variable annuity space.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	As a result, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from clients in this area.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	(1) The decline in assets under advisement in 2012 and 2013 reflects difficult market conditions for companies that offer variable annuities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Some of our clients have been managing their funds-of-funds portfolios in-house instead of using outside subadvisors.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Because of this trend, assets under advisement were down $10.8 billion in 2013 and $43.2 billion in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	The asset change in 2012 reflects both the loss of business from a large client and a change in the scope of services provided to another client.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	We also provide Investment Advisory services for some assets for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We cannot separately quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios because we do not have custody of the assets in the majority of our investment management businesses.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The information we receive from many of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	We also cannot precisely quantify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	(2) We cannot separately quantify the factors affecting assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	These factors primarily consist of employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	We cannot quantify the impact of these other factors because the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	(3) Beginning with the third quarter of 2013, we revised our segment structure to reflect our shift to a more centralized organizational structure.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	In addition, we took this opportunity to revise our revenue by product structure to better represent how management internally reviews and evaluates product revenue and performance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The most significant revision is that Morningstar Data now excludes Morningstar Commodity Data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	We have reclassified the prior-year information to reflect these changes.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	We also made minor corrections to the total number of licenses for Morningstar Direct in 2012 and 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2013, our consolidated revenue rose 6.1% compared with the previous year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Although our Investment Advisory revenue was down about $7.2 million compared with 2012, most of our other major products performed well.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and Morningstar Retirement Solutions were some of our major growth drivers in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	In 2012, our consolidated revenue increased 4.3% .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Morningstar Direct was the main contributor to revenue growth, followed by Morningstar Data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Morningstar Advisor Workstation and Integrated Web Tools also made positive contributions, although to a lesser extent.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	These factors helped offset the loss of business from a large variable annuity client in our Investment Advisory business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	Because this client began managing several fund-of-funds portfolios in-house in April 2012, we recognized $3.8 million in associated revenue in 2012, down from $12.4 million in 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Investment information products, which make up about 80% of our consolidated revenue, rose $29.5 million , or 5.6% , in 2013 and $27.9 million , or 5.6% , in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Morningstar Direct was the biggest contributor to growth in this product group in both 2013 and 2012, with revenue increasing by $14.1 million in 2013 and $13.1 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to about 8,500 worldwide in 2013, compared with about 7,400 at the end of 2012 and 6,100 at the end of 2011, with strong growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Growth in Morningstar Direct reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients, and, to a lesser extent, client migrations from both Institutional Workstation and Morningstar EnCorr to Morningstar Direct.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Morningstar Data was the second-biggest contributor to growth in this product group in both 2013 and 2012, reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts for managed products data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Morningstar Data gives institutions access to a full range of proprietary investment data spanning numerous investment databases, including real-time pricing data, fundamental equity data, and managed investment product data.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The data packages we offer include proprietary statistics, such as the Morningstar Style Box and Morningstar Rating, and a wide range of other data, including information on investment performance, risk, portfolios, operations data, fees and expenses, cash flows, and ownership.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Morningstar Advisor Workstation (mainly Morningstar Office) had moderately positive revenue growth in both 2013 and 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The number of U.S. licenses for Morningstar Advisor Workstation increased to about 170,000 in 2013, compared with 163,000 at the end of 2012 and 160,000 at the end of 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	These positive growth trends were partially offset by lower revenue for Principia, which was down $4.8 million in 2013 and $1.8 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	During the first quarter of 2013, we announced that we are no longer selling new subscriptions to Principia, and we ve begun migrating Principia clients to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other Morningstar products that meet their needs.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	We expect to continue supporting clients on Principia until the end of 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Morningstar.com was up slightly in 2013, but declined by $2.7 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Revenue was down in 2012 because of declining paid Premium Membership subscriptions (mainly in the United States) and a difficult advertising sales market.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Investment management revenue, which represents about 20% of consolidated revenue, was up $10.5 million , or 7.9% , in 2013, as positive trends in assets under management for Retirement Solutions and Morningstar Managed Portfolios more than offset lower revenue for Investment Advisory services.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Companies that offer variable annuities have continued to face difficult market conditions, which has prompted some of our clients to begin managing their fund-of-funds portfolios in-house instead of using outside subadvisors.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Because of this trend, our Investment Advisory revenue was about $7.2 million lower in 2013 versus 2012, and assets under advisement for these services were down $10.8 billion over the same period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Investment management revenue decreased $1.0 million , or 0.7% , in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The loss of some business from a large client in the variable annuity industry was the main reason for this decline.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	Excluding the loss of this business, Investment Advisory revenue was up $3.4 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	Revenue for Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and to a lesser extent, Retirement Solutions, also rose in 2012, partially offsetting negative trends in Investment Advisory.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The asset-based fees we earn are primarily based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Average assets under advisement and management (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $161.6 million in 2013, compared with $181.0 million in 2012 and $165.3 million in 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	We had $88.6 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2013 , an increase of $7.2 million compared with $81.4 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	In 2011 , revenue from asset-based fees was $81.7 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12.7% of consolidated revenue in 2013 , up slightly from 12.4% in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The variable annuity industry, which accounted for approximately 2% and 3% of consolidated revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively, continues to face challenges.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Accordingly, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from variable annuity clients.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	To allow for more meaningful comparisons of our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	During the second quarter of 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB to become the sole owner.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	We divested several smaller business lines during 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	In 2013, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures was essentially neutral, as we had $3.7 million in incremental revenue from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Morningstar Sweden, which was offset by the loss of $4.1 million in revenue from business lines we divested in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	In addition, currency translations reduced revenue by about $3.6 million in 2013, mainly because of the weaker Australian dollar.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 6.7% in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2012, currency translations reduced revenue by about $4.6 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, were the primary reasons for the negative currency effect.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Divestitures reduced revenue by an additional $1.1 million in 2012, and we had no incremental revenue from acquisitions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 5.2% in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non- GAAP financial measure.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	International revenue made up about 28% of our consolidated revenue in 2013, 2012, and 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revenue from international operations rose 3.2% in 2013, as our operations in Continental Europe enjoyed stronger product sales, but this growth was partly offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translations (mainly the weaker Australian dollar).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	In 2012, international revenue was up 3.5% , mainly because of stronger product sales in Europe and Canada, partially offset by lower revenue in Australia.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Divestitures had a slight negative effect on international revenue in 2012, while foreign currency translations decreased revenue by $4.6 million , mainly because of the euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of foreign currency translations):
1289419_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data, Investment Advisory services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was between 90% and 95% in 2013, within the same range as 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	In 2013, we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products, such as Principia, Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, and print and online newsletters, was between 65% and 70%, within the same range as 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	(1) We now include development expense in the cost of revenue category, which we previously referred to as cost of goods sold.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	We have reclassified development expense to include it in cost of revenue for all periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	We previously reported development expense as a separate operating expense category.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Separately, as a result of our recent reorganization (including new positions created, changes in focus for some existing roles, and the refinement of employee cost categorizations as we moved to a more centralized structure), approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with 2012 and 2011, changes related to our more centralized organizational structure added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue, and reduced the compensation expense in our sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	These changes did not affect our total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	(2) Includes stock-based compensation expense of:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	In 2013, our operating expense was up $20.0 million , or 3.9% , mainly because of higher salary expense, depreciation expense, professional fees, and bonus expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Salary expense rose $6.3 million for the year, primarily because of pay raises made in July 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	In addition, while headcount was down in the first nine months of the year, we hired about 75 net new employees during the fourth quarter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	By the end of 2013, we had about 3,565 employees worldwide, compared with 3,495 at the end of 2012 and 3,465 at the end of 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Depreciation increased $5.1 million, mainly reflecting additional capitalized software development and computer software purchases for our U.S. operations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Professional fees were up $5.0 million in 2013, mainly reflecting higher legal expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Bonus expense rose $4.6 million in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	We review our estimates for the size of the bonus pool quarterly and make adjustments based on our expectations for full-year revenue and operating income relative to internal targets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	In 2012, operating expense rose $14.6 million or 3.0% , mainly because of a $14.0 million increase in salary expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Salary expense was up because of the full-year effect of regular pay raises and market adjustments made in July 2011, as well as regular pay raises made in July 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	New hires in 2011 and 2012 also contributed to the growth in salary expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Higher professional fees, production expense, company-sponsored benefits (including matching contributions to our 401(k) plan for U.S. employees), and stock-based compensation expense also added to our expense base in 2012, although to a lesser extent than the salary costs discussed above.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Stock-based compensation expense in 2012 included $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to a former executive in our structured credit research unit when we acquired the business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	Additional data purchases contributed to the $3.8 million growth in production expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue was down 1.5 percentage points in 2013 and 1.0 percentage point in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Cost of revenue (which we previously referred to as cost of goods sold) is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and we include compensation costs for the employees who produce our products and services in cost of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	We now include development expense in this category and have reclassified development expense to include it in cost of revenue for all periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Cost of revenue was up $24.7 million , or 10.0% , in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	Higher compensation expense of $14.0 million (mainly because of the shift in expense categories discussed above) was the main contributor to the increase.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	We included compensation expense in this category for approximately 2,880 employees as of December 31, 2013 (about 80% of our total employees), compared with approximately 2,585 as of December 31, 2012 (about 75% of our total employees).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	We capitalized $8.1 million of compensation expense related to software development activities in 2013, reducing cost of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	For comparison, we capitalized $8.5 million of expense in this category in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Cost of revenue rose $11.5 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Higher salary expense contributed about $10.4 million of this increase, mainly because of additional headcount.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	We also had higher production expense of $3.8 million because of additional data purchases for our operations in the United States and Europe.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	Other compensation-related expense (mainly for employee benefits) was another factor behind higher cost of revenue in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P97_S4	We capitalized $8.5 million of operating expense in 2012 compared with $5.3 million in 2011 for software development, reducing the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our gross margin declined by about 1.4 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	In 2013, about 2 percentage points of the decline resulted from the shift in expense categories discussed above.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Sales and marketing expense was down $5.3 million in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Lower salary-related and bonus expense of $6.4 million (including approximately $8 million from the shift in expense categories as a result of our recent reorganization), was the main reason for the decline.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	We included compensation expense in this category for approximately 290 employees as of December 31, 2013 compared with approximately 350 as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	Higher sales commissions of $2.6 million partly offset this decrease.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Sales and marketing expense rose $2.2 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	Salary expense increased $4.1 million and bonus expense was up $1.5 million, but these were partially offset by lower costs for advertising, marketing, and commissions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	Full-year bonus expense included in this category was flat in 2012; however, in the first quarter of 2012, we paid a greater portion of the 2011 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $1.0 million to the bonus expense recorded in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down 1.7 percentage points in 2013 and 0.4 percentage points in 2012, mainly because of lower salary expense as a percentage of revenue in both years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	In 2012, advertising and marketing and commissions also declined as a percentage of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	In 2013, 1.1 percentage points of the decline was driven by the shift in expense categories discussed above.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense was down $2.0 million in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	There were three main items that contributed to the decline in G A expense in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	First, G A expense in 2012 included $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to a former executive in the structured credit research unit when we acquired the business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	This expense did not recur in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	Second, we had an additional $1.6 million of combined expense in 2012 for an impairment charge for one of our smaller products and a litigation settlement.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	This expense did not recur in 2013, either.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S4	Third, salary expense was down about $0.9 million (including a reduction of approximately $6 million from the shift in expense categories as a result of our recent reorganization).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P104_S5	We included compensation expense in this category for approximately 395 employees as of December 31, 2013, compared with approximately 560 as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Higher professional fees of $3.6 million partially offset the decline in G A expense in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, our 2012 results included a benefit of approximately $1.0 million for the resolution of a prior-year business tax expense matter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	This benefit did not recur in 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	G A expense rose $0.8 million in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Higher professional fees and higher stock-based compensation expense contributed to the total increase in G A. As mentioned above, stock-based compensation expense in 2012 included $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	Lower bonus expense of $5.7 million in 2012 partially offset the increase.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P106_S3	Current-year bonus expense was down $2.8 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P106_S4	In addition, in the first quarter of 2011, we paid a greater portion of the 2010 bonus to employees in this category compared with our initial estimate, contributing $2.6 million to the bonus expense recorded in 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	G A expense in 2012 included about $1.6 million of expense for a litigation settlement and an impairment charge for one of our smaller products.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	However, as mentioned above, our 2012 results included a benefit of approximately$1.0 million from the resolution of a prior-year business tax expense matter.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Conversely, our results for 2011 included $1.4 million of expense related to this business tax.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	G A expense in 2011 also included $3.2 million for the separation agreement with our former chief operating officer.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P107_S4	This expense did not recur in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	G A expense as a percentage of revenue was down 1.2 percentage points in 2013 and 0.6 percentage points in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	In 2013, 0.9 percentage points of the decline was driven by the shift in expense categories discussed above.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.5 million in 2013 and $3.3 million in 2012, mainly because some of the intangible assets from some of our previous acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	Amortization expense was also down in 2012 because of a favorable comparison with 2011, when our results included $1.6 million of expense for the accelerated amortization of certain trade names and the impairment of one trade name.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	However, depreciation expense rose $5.1 million in 2013, mainly because of additions to capitalized software development and purchases of computer software for our U.S. operations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P109_S3	Depreciation expense rose $3.5 million in 2012, mainly driven by an increase in capital spending for our U.S. operations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining lives of the assets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	We estimate that total amortization expense for intangible assets will be approximately $20.5 million in 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, dispositions, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and currency translations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Overall, depreciation and amortization was unchanged in 2013 and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $20.0 million in 2013 as our revenue increased $40.0 million and operating expense rose by $20.0 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Operating margin was 24.4% , an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared with 2012, mainly reflecting higher operating margins for the first three quarters of the year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Lower salary expense as a percentage of revenue contributed approximately 1.0 percentage points to the margin improvement in 2013; lower stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue also had favorable effects of 0.7 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	On the negative side, professional fees and depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue were both up 0.6 percentage points, and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue rose 0.4 percentage points.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	In 2012, consolidated operating income rose $12.3 million , and our margin was up 1.0 percentage points.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	Our revenue growth of $26.9 million outpaced the increase in our costs of $14.6 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Lower bonus expense contributed 1.3 percentage points to our margin growth in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	In addition, capitalized operating expense for software development contributed 0.5 percentage points to our margin growth in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	Higher salaries and other compensation-related expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset these increases, and acquisitions also had a slight negative effect on the margin.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities mainly consists of our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Beginning in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, it also includes our portion of the net income (loss) of YCharts, Inc. (YCharts) and Inquiry Financial Europe AB, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	In September 2012, we acquired a 34% minority equity stake in Inquiry Financial Europe AB for $3.6 million, paid in cash.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	In November 2011, we acquired a 22% minority equity stake in YCharts for $2.5 million, paid in cash.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	In 2012, 2011, and the first four months of 2013, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Sweden.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	In May 2013, we acquired the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden for $14.6 million in cash, increasing our ownership interest to become the sole owner.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	Because Morningstar Sweden is now a wholly owned subsidiary, we no longer account for our investment using the equity method.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	The following table presents the components of net non-operating income (expense):
1289419_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	The decrease in interest income in 2013 reflects lower balances of cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	Interest income in 2012 also included approximately $0.7 million of interest income related to the business tax refund for prior years recorded in 2012, as discussed above in the section, Consolidated Results .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P120_S3	In 2011, interest expense included $0.9 million related to the $1.4 million of business tax expense for prior years recorded in 2011, as discussed above in the section Consolidated Results .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	Other expense, net includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	In 2012, other expense, net included the loss on the sale of our investment in Bundle Corporation of $2.0 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2013 was 31.2% , a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared with 33.9% in 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	The decrease mainly reflects adjustments to certain deferred income tax benefits and the recognition of additional tax credits and incentives.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2012 was 33.9%, an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared with 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	The higher tax rate in 2012 reflects lower tax credits and incentives in the current year, as well as certain deferred income tax benefits recorded in 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and outside sources, will be sufficient to meet our operating and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments, consisting primarily of fixed-income securities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S2	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high-quality stand-alone credit ratings.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S3	Investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years; the weighted average maturity is approximately one year.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S4	We also invest a portion of our investments balance (approximately $19.7 million, or 15%, of our total investment balance as of December 31, 2013 ) in proprietary Morningstar portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P126_S5	These portfolios may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, or ETFs.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	Approximately 51% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2013 was held by our operations in the United States, down from about 58% as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	Given our strong liquidity in the United States, we do not expect to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P127_S2	We have not recognized deferred tax liabilities for the portion of the outside basis differences (including unremitted earnings) relating to foreign subsidiaries because the investment in these subsidiaries is considered to be permanent in duration.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P127_S3	Quantification of the deferred tax liability associated with these outside basis differences is not practicable.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	To date, we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not borrowed under any lines of credit.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	In 2013 , we paid dividends of $17.4 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	We made only three dividend payments in 2013 because we opted to pay the dividend originally scheduled for January 2013 in December 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P129_S2	In February 2014, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 17 cents per share.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P129_S3	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2014 to shareholders of record as of April 11, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P129_S4	We expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 17 cents per share in 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	In December 2013, our board of directors approved a $200 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $700 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P130_S1	We may repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P130_S2	In 2013, we repurchased a total of approximately 2.0 million shares for $153.5 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P130_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , we had repurchased a total of approximately 7.1 million shares for $449.8 million under this program since we originally announced it in October 2010.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	In 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $186.7 million , driven by $123.4 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $15.6 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $298.6 million , a decrease of $22.9 million compared with $321.4 million as of December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	The change reflects cash provided by operating activities partially offset by $153.5 million used to repurchase common stock, bonus payments of $36.6 million made during the first quarter of 2013 related to the 2012 bonus, and $33.6 million of capital expenditures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P132_S2	In addition, we used approximately $14.6 million in cash to acquire the remaining 76% of Morningstar Sweden to become sole owner.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	We expect to continue making significant capital expenditures in 2014, mainly for computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations, and capitalized software.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	In addition, we expect to make further investments in network and systems security in an amount that may be material.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	We also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2014 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $40 million related to the 2013 bonus.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P135_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P135_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P136_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	We generated positive free cash flow in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded capital expenditures, as shown below:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	We generated positive free cash flow of $153.1 million in 2013, an increase of $37.1 million versus 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	In 2012, free cash flow was down $25.7 million from 2011, reflecting lower cash provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures compared with 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	In May 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB (Morningstar Sweden), increasing our ownership to 100% from 24%.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 or 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	We invested a total of $10.8 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P139_S3	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 6 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	We sold two businesses in 2012 and received a total of $6.7 million related to these sales.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	For more information, please see Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	See Note 17 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on events subsequent to December 31, 2013 .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P144_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P144_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P144_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P144_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P146_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P146_S2	We also provide analysis, consulting, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P146_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	Probability of collection is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P150_S2	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , our deferred revenue was $149.2 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S3	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S4	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P151_S5	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation experts for significant assets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	The determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles including internally developed software and databases, and non-compete agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	These valuation approaches include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P158_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P158_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P158_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as Goodwill which is not amortized.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon the estimated fair value of our reporting units.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P159_S3	Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, the goodwill balance would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for businesses and determination of weighted average cost of capital.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P160_S2	We believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations in connection with acquisitions and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Under FASB ASC 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation , we measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the cost as expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S2	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S3	We ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S4	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P162_S5	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P163_S1	In addition, we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	We believe that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P166_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P166_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P166_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $33.2 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $45.6 million .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	The deferred tax assets include $9.2 million of deferred tax assets related to $45.4 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P169_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $8.8 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P170_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P170_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P170_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	We assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 , Income Taxes.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S3	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P171_S5	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations, which we describe in Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P175_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P175_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent's Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	ASU No. 2013-05 specifies that when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in Subtopic 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S2	Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S3	Additionally, the amendments in this update clarify that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both (1) events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and (2) events that results in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S4	The currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P176_S5	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2013-05 is effective prospectively for events occurring on or after January 1, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).
1289419_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	This update requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward, or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, rather than as a liability when (1) the uncertain tax position would reduce the NOL or other carryforward under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction and (2) the entity intends to use the deferred tax asset for that purpose.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	The update does not require new recurring disclosures.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P177_S3	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2013-11 is effective prospectively as of January 1, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2013-05 and ASU No. 2013-11 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	(2) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits) recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	The table excludes $6.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We invest our investment portfolio mainly in high-quality fixed-income securities.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $298.6 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $0.5 million.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As our non-U.S. revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue, fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our operations are subject to currency risk related to the British pound, the euro, and the Australian and Canadian dollars, among other currencies.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar.
1289419_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	In addition, because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency, we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company's) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited Morningstar Inc. s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Morningstar, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

1289419_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	Morningstar, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Morningstar, we, our), is a provider of independent investment research to investors around the world.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conduct our business operations through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest have been consolidated.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	In accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, we present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in two separate but consecutive statements, our Consolidated Statements of Income and separately, our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	In addition, effective January 1, 2013, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2013-2, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	We show the effects of items reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where net income is presented.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	We now include development expense in the cost of revenue category, which we previously referred to as cost of goods sold.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	We previously reported development expense as a separate operating expense category.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	We have reclassified development expense to include it in cost of revenue for all periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Separately, as a result of our recent reorganization (including new positions created, changes in focus for some existing roles, and the refinement of employee cost categorizations as we moved to a more centralized structure), approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	For 2013 as compared with both 2012 and 2011, changes related to our more centralized organizational structure added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue, and reduced the compensation expense in our sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million, respectively.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	These changes did not affect our total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	We state at fair value the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds, which are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of fixed-income securities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs as described below:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 5 in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments , permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	FASB ASC 825 allows the fair value option to be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis when the asset or liability is initially recognized or when there's an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	We do not apply this fair value option to any of our eligible assets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three years.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service yet are included in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The table below summarizes our capitalized software development costs for the past three years:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their full fair values as of the date control is obtained, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S4	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P41_S5	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations on the acquisition date.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and values applicable for income tax purposes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions and divestitures.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2013, 2012, and 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2013, 2012, and 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S4	We recorded an impairment loss of approximately $800,000 in 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S5	We did not record any impairment losses in 2013 or 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P45_S6	The impairment charge is included in our amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite for recognition of revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Equity Research, Premium Membership fees for Morningstar.com, our structured credit research and ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	For new-issue ratings and analysis for CMBS, we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance of the transaction.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Our Investment Advisory business includes a broad range of services.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Pricing for consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service provided, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Our Retirement Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	For our Retirement Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The revenue arrangements for Retirement Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements with our customers combine multiple products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of licenses or subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided, which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units and restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P62_S3	For stock options granted in 2011, we estimated the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P62_S4	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, in general, Morningstar's full-time employees are eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P64_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave which is included in Accrued Compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements, and also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding primarily reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	We further compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The following table shows the number of weighted average stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share from both continuing operations and net earnings because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	These stock options and restricted stock units could be included in the calculation in the future.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	In the third quarter of 2013, we revised our segment structure to reflect our shift to a more centralized organizational structure.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	We now report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	We have revised our historical financial results to reflect this change.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 2 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	We evaluate the performance of our reporting segment based on revenue and operating income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	We derive revenue from two product groups.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The investment information product group includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	These products are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The investment management product group includes all of our asset management operations, which earn the majority of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The table below summarizes our revenue by product group:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The tables below summarize our revenue and long-lived assets by geographical area:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	We classify our investments in three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	We monitor the concentration, diversification, maturity, and liquidity of our investment portfolio, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities, and classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , held-to-maturity investments included a $1,500,000 certificate of deposit, held primarily as collateral against bank guarantees for our office leases, primarily in Australia.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	The fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements and that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the fair value hierarchy and the necessary disclosures under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , are as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting these investment categories each in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	There were no transfers between levels one and two during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, equity securities, and ETFs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from observable market data.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	In May 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB (Morningstar Sweden), increasing our ownership to 100% from 24% .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	Morningstar s main offerings in Sweden include Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Integrated Web Tools, and Morningstar.se, a website for individual investors that provides fund and ETF data, portfolio tools, and market analysis.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 2, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	Morningstar Sweden's total estimated fair value of $18,513,000 included $14,554,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden and $3,959,000 related to the 24% of Morningstar Sweden we previously held.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 24% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest by applying a minority interest discount based on analysis of comparable transactions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash holding gain of $3,635,000 , which is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	The allocation included acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $2,272,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	Goodwill of $8,911,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer Morningstar's full suite of products and services to investors in Sweden and further leverage Morningstar's global reach, investment databases, and technology expertise.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2012 and 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013 :
1289419_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2013 , 2012 , or 2011 , as the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	The following table summarizes our intangible assets:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following table summarizes our amortization expense related to intangible assets:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	In 2011, we recorded an impairment loss of approximately $800,000 for an acquired intangible asset.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2013 or 2012.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their expected economic useful lives.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	Based on acquisitions and divestitures completed through December 31, 2013 , we expect intangible amortization expense for 2014 and subsequent years to be as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful life, and currency translations.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	In October 2012, we sold Morningstar Investor Relations Services to UK-based Investis, a leading specialist in digital corporate communications for public companies.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P116_S1	In October 2012, we also sold the Morningstar Australasia trade publishing assets to Sterling Publishing Pty Ltd.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	We have not reclassified the operating results of these businesses to discontinued operations, nor have we reclassified the related assets and liabilities to held for disposition, because these amounts are not significant to our consolidated statements or segment disclosures.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011:

1289419_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	Inquiry Financial is a provider of sell-side consensus estimate data.

1289419_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	YCharts is a technology company that provides stock research and analysis.

1289419_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2012, other equity-method investments also included our investment in Morningstar Sweden.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	Our ownership interest and profit-and-loss sharing interest in Morningstar Sweden was 24% at that date.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P125_S2	In May 2013, we acquired the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden, increasing our ownership to 100% .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P125_S3	See Note 6 for additional information concerning our acquisition of Morningstar Sweden.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	We did not record any impairment losses on our equity method investments in 2013 , 2012 , or 2011.

1289419_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	The following table summarizes our rent expense including taxes, insurance, and other operating costs:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	Deferred rent includes build-out and rent abatement allowances received, which are amortized over the remaining portion of the original term of the lease as a reduction in office lease expense.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P135_S1	We include deferred rent, as appropriate, in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Deferred rent, noncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	We include our liability for vacant office space in "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities," as appropriate, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	The following table shows the change in our liability for vacant office space from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013 :
1289419_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	Our shareholders approved the Morningstar 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) on May 17, 2011.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P137_S1	As of that date we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	The 2004 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Morningstar 2000 Stock Option Plan, and the Morningstar 2001 Stock Option Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	The 2011 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including, among other things, stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	We granted stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock under the 2004 Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P140_S1	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P140_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P140_S3	Any shares subject to awards under the 2011 Plan, but not under the 2004 Plan, that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P140_S4	The following table summarizes the number of shares available for future grants under our 2011 Plan:

1289419_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2013 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P143_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P144_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P144_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P144_S3	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	In conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition in May 2010, we issued 199,174 shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	The restricted stock vests ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	Because of the terms of the restricted share agreements prepared in conjunction with the Realpoint acquisition, we account for the grant of restricted shares as stock-based compensation expense and not as part of the acquisition consideration.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	We measured the fair value of the restricted stock on the date of grant based on the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P149_S1	We amortize the fair value of $9,363,000 to stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P149_S2	The stock-based compensation expense recorded in 2012 and 2011 includes approximately $3,238,000 and $396,000 , respectively, of expense recognized upon the accelerated vesting of restricted stock.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P149_S3	We have assumed that all of the remaining restricted stock will ultimately vest, and therefore we have not incorporated a forfeiture rate for purposes of determining the stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P150_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	Almost all of the outstanding options granted under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan have a premium price feature in which the exercise price increases over the term of the option at a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield as of the date of grant.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	Options granted under the 2011 Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P152_S2	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P152_S3	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2013 :
1289419_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2013 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P156_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $78.09 on that date.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P157_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return that exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Statement of Income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P157_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	In 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	The following table presents the components of our net non-operating income:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	Interest income primarily reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	Interest income in 2012 included approximately $700,000 of interest income related to a $1,000,000 of business tax refund for prior years recorded in 2012 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P161_S2	In 2011, interest expense included approximately $900,000 related to $1,400,000 of business tax expense for prior years recorded in 2011 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	Other expense, net includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	In 2012, other expense, net included the loss on the sale of our investment in Bundle Corporation of $2,034,000 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ending December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P167_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	Our U.S. federal NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2013 of $2,136,000 is subject to limitations on the use of the NOL imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and therefore is limited to approximately $225,000 per year.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	The decrease in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2013 compared with 2013 primarily reflects the utilization of NOL carryforwards in our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $112,600,000 as of December 31, 2013 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P173_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $8,759,000 of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P175_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P175_S3	In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally extends to years prior to 2005.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P176_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $6,211,000 and a non-current liability of $6,012,000 for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P178_S1	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	In 2013 , we recorded a net increase of $3,532,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $3,227,000 increased our income tax expense by $2,690,000 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P180_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $3,275,000 for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $2,785,000 decreased our income tax expense by $2,301,000 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had $12,958,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $10,557,000 , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $9,262,000 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P182_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	We recorded the decrease in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2013 .
1289419_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	In September 2011, three individual investors in Life's Good S.T.A.B.L. Mortgage hedge fund (LG), Marta Klass, Gregory Martin, and Richard Roellig, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against LG, its principal Robert Stinson, and several other parties, including Morningstar, Inc. (the Klass Matter).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	The plaintiffs claim that Morningstar committed fraud and aided and abetted the other defendants' breach of fiduciary duty through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	Hedge fund managers self-report their performance data to Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	More than a year before the Klass Matter, in June 2010, the SEC filed suit against LG and other entities claiming they were part of a Ponzi scheme operated by Stinson.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P186_S1	As a result, LG and the other entities were placed in court-appointed receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P186_S2	Morningstar was not part of the SEC suit or receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P186_S3	Since that time, the Receiver, as part of his duties, has been investigating whether to assert claims against third parties.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	Morningstar is aware of 14 lawsuits filed by the Receiver seeking to recover money for the fund.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	In November 2011, Morningstar filed a motion to dismiss the Klass Matter.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	On behalf of the entities in receivership, the Receiver filed a motion to stay the proceedings because the Receivership Order does not permit suits against the entities in receivership without court permission.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	The court granted the Receiver's motion and stayed the Klass Matter.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	In April 2012, the Receiver filed a complaint against Morningstar, in which the Receiver claims that Morningstar is liable for contribution and aiding and abetting Stinson's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud through the 5-star rating LG obtained from Morningstar.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P190_S1	The same day the Receiver filed his complaint, Morningstar sought leave from the court to file a counter suit against Stinson and two of his entities-Keystone State Capital Corporation and LG for, among other things, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of user agreements.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P190_S2	In June 2012, the court denied Morningstar's motion for leave to file suit.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P190_S3	The court took no position on the merits of Morningstar's claims, and did not preclude us from renewing our motion to file a complaint at a later time, but deferred to the Receiver's request not to subject the receivership estate to additional litigation at this early point in the receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	A bench trial related to the Receiver s claims against Morningstar was held between January 13 and January 28, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	At trial, the Receiver claimed that Morningstar is liable under a contribution theory for all or part of a $14.5 million disgorgement judgment that the SEC obtained against the entities and individuals in receivership.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	Morningstar contested liability and damages at trial and believes it is not liable for any amount.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P192_S2	The parties will file post-trial proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in early March 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P192_S3	It is not known when the court will issue its decision.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	We believe the allegations against Morningstar by the Klass plaintiffs and the Receiver have no legal or factual basis and we plan to continue to vigorously contest the claims.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P193_S1	We also intend to refile our affirmative claims against Stinson, Keystone, and LG at a later time consistent with the court's order.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	We have not provided an estimate of loss or range of loss in connection with this matter because no such estimate can reasonably be made.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	In November 2009, Business Logic Holding Corporation filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Ibbotson Associates, Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. relating to Ibbotson's prior commercial relationship with Business Logic.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P196_S1	Business Logic is alleging breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation in connection with Ibbotson's development of a proprietary web-service software and user interface that connects plan participant data with the Ibbotson Wealth Forecasting Engine.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P196_S2	Ibbotson and Morningstar answered the complaint, and Ibbotson asserted a counterclaim against Business Logic alleging trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract, also seeking damages and injunctive relief.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P196_S3	Business Logic filed a motion for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, which was denied on October 1, 2013.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	Business Logic's complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	With regard to compensatory damages, based on the analysis of Ibbotson's retained damages expert (who has assumed, solely for purposes of his analysis, that Business Logic will prevail with regard to the issue of liability), and recognizing the uncertainty inherent in litigation and our intention to continue to vigorously defend the claims made by Business Logic, our best estimate of the range of possible loss is between $0 and $5.4 million, excluding punitive damages or attorneys' fees, both of which are recoverable in certain circumstances under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P197_S2	Business Logic's retained damages expert (who has also assumed for purposes of her estimate that Business Logic will prevail with regard to the issue of liability) has, however, estimated compensatory damages of $84 million, excluding punitive damages or attorneys' fees.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	We dispute the conclusions reached and the methods employed by Business Logic's expert.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	With regard to Business Logic's claim for injunctive relief, no reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss is possible.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Morningstar and Ibbotson continue to vigorously contest all the claims against them in this matter.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	We cannot, however, predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	We record accrued liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters represent loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrued liability.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, we evaluate on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	In addition to these proceedings, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	In September 2010, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P204_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we had repurchased a total of 7,068,006 shares for $449,784,000 under this authorization.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P204_S3	As of February 21, 2014, we had repurchased a total of approximately 7,350,000 shares, and approximately $230,000,000 remained available for future repurchases.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	The following table summarizes the board approvals for increases to the program and the total available under the program:
1289419_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	In February 2014 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 17 cents per share.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2014 to shareholders of record as of April 11, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent's Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S1	ASU No. 2013-05 specifies that when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in Subtopic 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S2	Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S3	Additionally, the amendments in this update clarify that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both (1) events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and (2) events that results in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquire in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S4	The currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P207_S5	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2013-05 is effective prospectively for events occurring on or after January 1, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).
1289419_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	This update requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an net operating loss (NOL) carryforward, or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, rather than as a liability when (1) the uncertain tax position would reduce the NOL or other carryforward under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction and (2) the entity intends to use the deferred tax asset for that purpose.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P208_S2	The update does not require new recurring disclosures.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P208_S3	For Morningstar, ASU No. 2013-11 is effective prospectively as of January 1, 2014.
1289419_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	We do not expect the provisions of ASU No. 2013-05 and ASU No. 2013-11 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2013 .
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
1289419_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and incorporated herein by reference.

1289419_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Morningstar is a leading provider of independent investment research in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	In addition to our U.S.-based products and services, we offer local versions of our products designed for investors in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Morningstar serves approximately 250,000 financial advisors, 1,700 asset management firms, 24 retirement plan providers, 290,000 retirement plan sponsors, and 9.9 million individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We build our own databases from the ground up, focusing on investment vehicles that are widely used by investors globally.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	After building these databases, we add value and insight to the data by applying our core skills of research, technology, and design.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we provided extensive data on approximately 500,000 investments, including mutual funds, stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, separate accounts, and variable annuities.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	We also track real-time market data on more than 14 million exchange-traded equities, derivatives, commodities, currencies, and other investments.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business model is based on leveraging our investments in these databases by selling a wide variety of products and services to financial advisors, asset managers, and retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors around the world.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our data and proprietary analytical tools such as the Morningstar Rating for mutual funds, which rates past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, and the Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund's underlying investment style, have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We've created other tools, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Market Barometer, which allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our popular Portfolio X-Ray tool helps investors evaluate their portfolios and get a clear view of their underlying holdings.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We ve been providing independent analyst research on mutual funds and other investment vehicles since the mid-1980s.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	To better represent the breadth and depth of their expertise, in 2014 we changed the name of our analyst team from fund research to manager research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our analysts do more than rate and cover funds they also specialize in analyzing the managers and firms that are running the funds.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	We provide a forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Rating for funds, a global, qualitative measure based on our analyst research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We expanded the scope of our coverage in 2014 by launching in-depth fund analyst reports with Morningstar Analyst Ratings for approximately 1,500 funds available for sale in Europe, Asia, and other regions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	We now provide research reports for approximately 4,200 funds globally, including active, passive, multi-asset, ETF, and closed-end fund strategies.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	We also offer qualitative research and ratings on alternative funds, state-sponsored college savings plan portfolios, and target-date funds.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 2014, we added new strategic beta attributes to help investors better identify, compare, and analyze strategic beta investments, a broad and growing category of indexes and exchange-traded products that seek to enhance returns or minimize risk relative to a traditional market cap-weighted benchmark.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	As part of our research efforts on individual stocks, we popularized the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett, and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	We offer a variety of other qualitative measures such as Stewardship Grades, which help investors identify companies and fund firms that have demonstrated a high level of commitment to shareholders and stewardship of investors' capital.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our analysts cover approximately 1,400 stocks, using a consistent, proprietary methodology that focuses on fundamental analysis, competitive advantage assessment, and intrinsic value estimation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	In 2014, we published Why Moats Matter: The Morningstar Approach to Stock Investing , a book that explains how we use the concept of economic moats to identify great businesses that can fend off competition and earn high returns on capital for many years.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	In addition to our analyst-driven coverage, we provide quantitative ratings and reports for nearly 50,000 companies globally.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	These equity ratings draw on the fundamental research of our equity analyst team and provide a forward-looking statistical view of the valuation, competitive advantage, and level of uncertainty for stocks that are often under-followed by other research firms.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Through our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary, which is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), we provide new issue and surveillance ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as well as operational risk assessment services.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	We provide surveillance ratings and analysis on approximately 6,800 CMBS securities including the loans and properties securing them.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition, we publish credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	We currently provide ratings on about 600 issuers.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Morningstar, Inc. is not an NRSRO, and our credit ratings on corporate issuers are not NRSRO credit ratings.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	We've developed in-depth advice on asset allocation, portfolio construction, and security selection to meet the needs of investors and professionals looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	We ve developed research on "Gamma," an innovative measure that quantifies how much additional retirement income investors can generate by making better financial planning decisions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We use the concept of human capital or potential future earning ability to provide a more complete picture of an investor s financial worth and optimize a portfolio s asset mix.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	In 2014, we published new research extending this methodology to examine how job, home location, and pension benefits, such as Social Security, affect an investor s optimal asset allocation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our strategy is to widen our economic moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, and build shareholder value by focusing on our three key objectives, which we describe in more detail below.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	In 2014, we revised how we describe our three key objectives to better capture our major goals.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We changed the description to emphasize that our investment data, research, and ratings are at the heart of our strategy, allowing us to help investors achieve better investment outcomes whether they make their own investment decisions or delegate management of their portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	We also revised the text of the first objective to focus on Morningstar Direct as our flagship decision support platform.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Develop Morningstar Direct as our flagship decision support platform.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	We're currently building the next-generation version of Morningstar Direct, our institutional investment research platform.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The new software uses a design standard that s more intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use and will give users a more consistent, cohesive experience with a strong emphasis on Morningstar s proprietary research and tools.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	It also has several technological advantages, including a more streamlined development process for commonly used Morningstar capabilities such as portfolio management tools.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	The new software is fully web-based and will address our clients increasing preference for cloud-based deployment, which eliminates the need for desktop software installations and allows immediate access to new features.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	It will help us innovate more rapidly and more easily configure our software solutions to meet client needs.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	It also addresses the growing need for mobile-optimized capabilities to extend the desktop experience onto mobile devices.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Over time, we expect to migrate many of our core software capabilities to Morningstar Direct, which will serve as our main platform for clients looking for information to support the investment decisions they make on their own or validate investment recommendations from another party.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Clients will benefit from cloud-based delivery, faster deployment, shorter upgrade cycles, and easier access to the latest versions of our proprietary tools and research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	We plan to introduce the next-generation version of Morningstar Direct in 2015, beginning with upgrades for many of our core capabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Over time, we expect the majority of our software to use this single technology platform.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	By moving many of our core research solutions to a common software platform, we'll be able to leverage our development resources, give our clients a more unified and consistent Morningstar experience, and better showcase our innovative research and analytical tools.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	We also plan to expand the user base for Morningstar Direct by enhancing workflow capabilities for our existing customer groups and adding additional workflows to reach new customers, such as financial advisors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Produce the most effective investment data, research, and ratings to help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our goal is to leverage our proprietary research and intellectual property to help investors with both decision support (via Morningstar Direct) and outsourced investment management (via our investment management business).
1289419_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our research is unique because we focus on building innovative solutions that help investors achieve better outcomes.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	We take a fundamental, bottom-up approach and focus on the long term.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We foster a culture in which our analysts frequently challenge each other s assumptions and speak freely and candidly about the investments they cover.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	We also emphasize innovation and strive to develop tools that help investors develop fresh insights on their portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	We re focusing our research efforts on several different areas, as described below.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our strategy for manager research is to leverage our leadership position to reach additional customer groups.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	We can help clients with every stage of the manager research workflow, including data, analytical tools, investor education, strategy research, platform approval, due diligence, lists of recommended funds, and portfolio management.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	In contrast to most of our competitors, we also integrate our manager research efforts with our software, which we believe is another competitive advantage.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	In 2014, we launched Morningstar Manager Research Services, which combines our fund research reports, ratings, software, tools, and proprietary data with access to Morningstar s manager research analysts.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Having direct access to our analysts can help institutions complete their research and due diligence, select investments, and create portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	As institutional clients work to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment, we can help them supplement their own research and support their communication efforts with financial advisors and individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	We've built an integrated team of locally based manager research experts to expand our research coverage in additional markets around the world.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had 110 manager research analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our equity research complements our approach to manager research, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund's portfolio.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had more than 100 equity analysts globally, making us one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe our analysts long-term approach, deep industry knowledge, and focus on sustainable competitive advantage are important factors that set us apart and help investors achieve better investment outcomes.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our equity research helps institutional investors and portfolio managers extend their internal research capabilities and support their investment decisions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	They can also engage directly with our industry-focused equity and credit analysts to discuss company valuations, forecasts, industry dynamics, and competitive landscapes.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	We also provide our equity research to financial advisors, who can use our research reports either as a primary research source or to complement research generated in-house or by other firms.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	We deliver our equity research and ratings through a variety of platforms, including Morningstar Advisor Workstation as well as third-party providers.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	We're committed to maintaining the broad, high-quality coverage we've become known for as one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	We're working to expand distribution of our equity research through a variety of channels, including financial advisors, institutional investment firms, and companies outside of the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe that investors' increasing awareness of the value of independent research will strengthen our business over the long term.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	We've also expanded our proprietary stock database, which we view as an important complement to our analyst research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, our structured credit research and ratings subsidiary, is an NRSRO that has earned a reputation for innovation and excellence in the structured finance market.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our goal is to help institutional investors identify credit risk in structured finance investments.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our analytical approach stresses transparency of the ratings process, strong fundamental credit analysis, and comprehensive investor-focused reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	We provide structured finance investors with access to high-quality ratings, investment research, surveillance services, data, and technology solutions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Over the past several years, we have made substantial investments in building our credit ratings business.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	We believe we have a unique viewpoint to offer on company default risk that leverages our cash-flow modeling expertise, proprietary measures like economic moat, and in-depth knowledge of the companies and industries we cover.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Morningstar Credit Ratings recently applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expand its NRSRO license to include credit ratings for corporate bonds and financial institutions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	We re applying to expand the NRSRO license because we believe we can make a difference in the market by bringing transparency, unique perspectives, and superior client service to all investors across the fixed-income markets.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Over the past several years, we ve developed new research tools that provide a more holistic approach to investing and asset allocation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Whereas traditional asset allocation methodologies focus solely on financial assets (such as stocks and bonds), we ve developed methodologies that provide a more complete view of all sources of wealth, including financial capital, human capital, housing assets, and retirement and pension benefits.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	This Total Wealth Approach is the touchstone for our approach to asset allocation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Going forward, we plan to build on this research and incorporate it in more of our products and solutions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	3. Build world-class investment management solutions based on our proprietary research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	We leverage our innovative, proprietary research by building world-class investment management solutions that help investors achieve better outcomes.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our strategy is to connect our existing capabilities to create holistic solutions that help financial advisors, asset managers, and individual investors with portfolio construction, monitoring, security selection, and implementation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our Investment Advisory services combine managed investment vehicles typically mutual funds in portfolios designed to help investors meet their financial goals.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	When we create portfolios, our goal is to simplify the investment process and help investors access portfolios that match their level of risk tolerance, time horizon, and long-term investment objectives.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	We draw on our extensive experience analyzing managed investment products and combine quantitative research with a qualitative assessment of manager skill and investment style.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	We had a total of $81.0 billion in assets under advisement in our Investment Advisory business as of December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	We offer managed retirement account services through our Retirement Solutions platform and had $36.8 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts as of December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	We offer these services for retirement plan participants who choose to delegate management of their portfolios to us.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe retirement plan participants will continue to adopt managed accounts because of the complexity involved in retirement planning.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Following our 2014 acquisition of HelloWallet Holdings, Inc., we plan to incorporate holistic advice to address the market need for a more comprehensive retirement offering.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe there s a significant opportunity in the retirement industry to develop a platform that can bring into focus a participant s entire financial and investment picture and deliver a unique and highly personalized managed investment solution.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe financial advisors are increasingly turning to outsourced investment management as they seek to spend more time building client relationships and providing holistic advice.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	This trend includes both fully outsourced investment management through managed portfolios, as well as partially outsourced services for advisors who want to improve their efficiency and scale while maintaining a role in investment management.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	We currently support the fully outsourced model through Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we managed $9.3 billion in assets through this service.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	In addition, we believe many financial advisors are seeking to provide holistic advice that incorporates all of their clients financial needs, including retirement assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Over time, we plan to build more connections between our advisor software offerings and the Retirement Solutions platform to meet this emerging need.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	We also expect to expand the investment management solutions we offer through our index business.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	We currently offer more than 280 investment indexes that can be used for both benchmarking and product creation.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	We plan to create more indexes based on strategic beta, which refers to a broad and growing category of indexes and exchange-traded products that seek to enhance returns or minimize risk relative to a traditional market cap-weighted benchmark.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	We believe we re uniquely positioned to deliver highly differentiated indexes based on our proprietary research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	For example, our Wide Moat Focus Index includes 20 companies we believe have a sustainable competitive advantage and are trading at the highest ratio of estimated fair value compared with the stock price.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Given the core capabilities discussed above, we're focusing on four primary customer groups:
1289419_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	This customer group includes several different types of advisors, including independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker-dealers, dually registered advisors, and captive advisors who are employees of a broker-dealer.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Captive broker-dealers include wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, and banks.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Cerulli Associates estimates there were approximately 290,000 financial advisors in the United States as of the end of 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	We offer a comprehensive and integrated set of solutions, including proprietary investment methodologies, portfolio- and security-level research, and investment management.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	With our acquisition of ByAllAccounts, Inc. in 2014, we re able to integrate positional and transactional assets that are held away from the advisor s book of business at other banks, advisory firms, or online brokerages so advisors can build more comprehensive investment proposals and deliver more value to their clients.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe our products and tools are deeply embedded in many portions of financial advisors daily workflow.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	To build this business, we plan to expand the range of services we offer to help financial advisors with all aspects of their workflow, including investment decision-making, portfolio construction, client monitoring and reporting, practice management, portfolio rebalancing that connects with custodial and trading interfaces, and financial planning.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	We're expanding the outsourced investment management through Morningstar Managed Portfolios to help advisors save time and reduce compliance risk.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	We plan to add the data aggregation capabilities from ByAllAccounts to Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Advisor Workstation to give advisors a more complete view of their clients assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	In addition, we plan to build comprehensive advisory solutions that incorporate both retirement and non-retirement assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our main products for financial advisors are Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office) and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Asset management firms manage and distribute investment portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	We estimate that there are more than 3,000 asset management firms globally, ranging from large, global firms to firms with small fund lineups and operations in a single market or region.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, and distribution, as well as investment management (often referred to as the buy side ), which includes portfolio management, research, and securities analysis.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our asset management offerings help companies connect with their clients because many individual investors are familiar with Morningstar's intellectual capital and brand.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We offer a global reach and have earned investors trust in our unbiased approach, investor-centric mission, thought leadership, data, and investment research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our strategy for the asset management customer group includes expanding the range of services we offer, driving our thought leadership, helping clients adapt to regulatory change, and tailoring our offerings to meet the needs of asset management firms of various sizes.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	For the buy side, we provide award-winning equity research for active fundamental portfolio managers who want unbiased ideas that improve performance, as well as corporate credit research.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	We deliver focused ideas that can improve long-term performance and consistent global research methodologies that can integrate with the daily workflow for a portfolio manager or analyst.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our goal is to expand the number of asset management firms and individuals at these firms who employ Morningstar s research offerings to help them achieve better results for their clients.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We also plan to incorporate our proprietary research methodologies in our data, analytics, and tools to continue developing differentiated software and data offerings.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	The key products we offer for asset management firms include Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Enterprise Components, and Investment Advisory services.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	For the buy side, key products include Morningstar Research, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	In the retirement market, millions of investors are now charged with planning for their own retirement, mainly through self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k) plans.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Assets in 401(k) plans totaled an estimated $4.4 trillion as of June 30, 2014 based on data from the Investment Company Institute.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, we believe individual investors, financial advisors, employers, and government organizations have all become more aware of the need for advice and guidance that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our retirement offerings help retirement plan participants of all ages plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	We help plan providers manage their risks and costs while differentiating themselves in an increasingly competitive market.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	We believe that we re uniquely positioned as the only company that offers a full range of scalable, customizable retirement solutions driven by proprietary investment methodologies.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	We also help retirement plan sponsors enhance their investment lineups, meet their fiduciary obligations, and help their employees prepare for retirement.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Following our June 2014 acquisition of HelloWallet Holdings, Inc., we plan to expand our retirement advice to include guidance on the saving and spending decisions that ultimately determine how much employees are able to invest for retirement.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	We plan to integrate HelloWallet s capabilities with our retirement solutions during 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	We re developing the next-generation version of our Retirement Manager platform, with an improved user interface, responsive design, and enhanced asset-allocation guidance for both retirement and non-retirement assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	We're continuing to enhance our managed retirement accounts, which is the largest and fastest-growing product offering within our Retirement Solutions business.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	We also plan to increase our market penetration with the custom models we offer directly to retirement plan sponsors and expand our offerings in select markets outside the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our major products for the retirement customer group are Retirement Solutions, Investment Advisory services, and Investment Profiles.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	We offer products for individual investors who invest to build wealth and save for other goals, such as retirement or college tuition.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	While the number of individual investors in the United States has declined from peak levels, a Gallup survey released in January 2014 found that approximately 54% of individuals in the United States invest in the stock market either directly or through mutual funds or self-directed retirement plans.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	On a global basis, McKinsey Global Institute estimates that households own approximately $85.2 trillion in financial assets, with approximately 28.1% invested in equities and 71.9% in other investments including cash, money-market funds, and fixed-income securities.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	We design most of our products for individual investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing and investors who seek out third-party sources to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial advisors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Our independent investment research, proprietary ratings, and proven portfolio strategies enable investors to make sensible plans, select investments to meet their needs, and monitor their portfolios through changing markets with more confidence and clarity.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	We also reach individual investors through a series of investment newsletters, iPad and mobile applications, and through partnerships with other websites, such as Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, and Google Finance.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	To enable these companies to do business in their designated territories, we provide them with the rights to the Morningstar name and logo and with access to certain of our products and technology.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	Each company is responsible for developing marketing plans tailored to meet the specific needs of investors within its country and working with Morningstar's data collection and development centers to create and maintain databases, develop new products, and enhance existing products.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P145_S1	We try to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P145_S2	For example, in the normal course of business, we only provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P145_S3	We use these agreements to define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we have tried to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws of most of the jurisdictions in which we maintain operating companies.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	As we move into new countries, we consider adding to these registrations.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P146_S2	We have registered the Morningstar name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in various other countries.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P146_S3	In some jurisdictions, we also register certain product names.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are registered marks of Morningstar in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States, including patents held by our Ibbotson Associates subsidiary for lifetime asset allocation and asset allocation with annuities.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	We license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P149_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with most of our larger operating companies.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P150_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to market our products and develop and sell country-specific variants of products under the Morningstar name in their operating territories.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and recording it based on information found in public filings.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P152_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P152_S2	We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P152_S3	This tends to moderate seasonality in sales patterns for individual products.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	In 2014, our largest customer accounted for less than 2% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	The economic and financial information industry has been marked by increased consolidation over the past several years, with the strongest players generally gaining market share at the expense of smaller competitors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	Some of our main competitors include Bloomberg; Standard Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Financial; and Thomson Reuters.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	These companies have financial resources that are significantly greater than ours.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P155_S3	We also compete with a variety of other companies in specific areas of our business.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P157_S3	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P157_S4	This allows us to control our development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P172_S0	Additional legislation and regulations, including those relating to the activities of investment advisors and broker-dealers, changes in rules imposed by the SEC or other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may adversely affect our business and profitability.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P172_S1	Our business may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to it as an investment advisor or broker-dealer, but also by regulations that apply to companies generally.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P173_S0	We had approximately 3,760 employees as of December 31, 2014, including approximately 780 data analysts, 70 designers, 430 investment analysts (including consulting and quantitative research analysts), 1,100 programmers and technology staff, and 500 sales and marketing professionals.

1289419_15_ITEM1_P201_S0	We were incorporated in Illinois on May 16, 1984.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P201_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P202_S0	We maintain a website at http://corporate.morningstar.com .
1289419_15_ITEM1_P202_S1	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P202_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P202_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_15_ITEM1_P202_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our investment management operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Three of our subsidiaries, Ibbotson Associates, Inc., Morningstar Associates, LLC, and Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	These requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As registered investment advisors, all three subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, because these three subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we had $36.8 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Problems could arise if these programs assigned retirement plan participants to the wrong portfolios, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Clients may take legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on approximately $170 billion in assets as of December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We believe independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us (either intentionally or not) could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We offer products and services to our institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our institutional clients have generated a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue in recent years.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered and securities issued by our institutional clients.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The fact that our institutional clients pay us for certain products and services, as well as the fact that in some cases we make investment recommendations within the framework of client constraints, may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to produce competitive performance in our investment management offerings.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 30 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We believe these proprietary tools continue to provide us with a competitive advantage, but if tools similar to them become more widely available, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We believe lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Smaller companies may be able to introduce new research tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools at the same rate as in the past, we may not generate enough enthusiasm with potential clients to win new business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	We cannot guarantee that we will continue to successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Examples include the shift from local network to computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We are in the process of building the next-generation software for Morningstar Direct and other products, but we have not yet incorporated this software in our products.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe our ability to develop innovative technology has historically given us a competitive advantage.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As mentioned above, though, we believe lower technology costs and growth in open software platforms have lowered barriers to entry for new competitors.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our competitors may also be able to introduce new technology more rapidly than we are to meet changing market needs.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Customers routinely enter personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We also handle an increasing volume of personally identifiable information through Morningstar Office (including Back Office Services), Morningstar Direct, Enterprise Data Management, managed retirement accounts, and other areas of our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In 2014, we acquired HelloWallet, which provides personalized financial guidance to individuals through their employer benefit plans.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Through HelloWallet's website and mobile applications, employees enter their goals and priorities and add their financial information, including income, bank accounts, credit cards, retirement plans, insurance, and investments.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We also acquired ByAllAccounts, which uses technology to collect, consolidate, and transform financial account data and deliver it to any platform.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Both HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts handle a large volume of personally identifiable information as part of their normal business operations.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other information about individuals or their accounts.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We may suffer malicious attacks seeking to penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, Social Security number, account numbers, portfolio holdings, credit card information, or other personal information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations could adversely affect our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our investment management operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our investment advisory activities are complex.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act and ERISA.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If we fail to establish required licenses or regulatory approvals for our investment advisory operations, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary is an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examination by the SEC.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We also publish credit ratings and research on corporate debt issuers and recently applied to expand our NRSRO license to include corporate credit ratings and financial institution credit ratings.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny, and we cannot predict the effect of potential future regulatory changes on our corporate credit rating business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory or credit rating services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may adversely impact our business.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, along with more recent events, led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies, which make up a large percentage of our client base.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Some institutional clients have implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market in recent years, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Many companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation, which may increase their operating costs and cause them to reduce spending in other areas.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If financial markets around the world experience downturns or volatility, demand for our products and services may decline, and our revenue, operating income, and other financial results could suffer.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our structured credit rating business is subject to volatility from trends in new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The financial markets and many businesses operating in the financial services industry are highly volatile and are affected by factors, such as U.S. and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, that are beyond our control.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines as well as the effect of cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In 2014, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Asset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An outage of our database, technology-based products and services, or network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, much of which is geographically concentrated in our Chicago headquarters and other backup locations in the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our headquarters.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative effect on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We now have approximately 840 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fourth of our total workforce.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We have approximately 430 employees who work at our data collection facility in Mumbai, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Over the past 15 years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend was more dramatic in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Net inflows for passively managed vehicles were in excess of $400 billion, compared with only $40 billion of net inflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Actively managed U.S. equity funds had net outflows of nearly $100 billion for the year.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Overall, we estimate that passively managed portfolios now account for more than 30% of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our operations outside of the United States involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $209.3 million in revenue in 2014, or about 28% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on structured and corporate credit issuers.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These organizations generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	As of December 31, 2014, Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to employee salaries and benefits, marketing programs, office leases, and other infrastructure spending, which generally cannot be adjusted quickly.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If actual revenue falls below our expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S5	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S6	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P63_S7	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In the past, we granted stock options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2014, our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 169,810 shares of common stock, 154,864 of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $38.53 per share.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	As of December 31, 2014, there were 670,712 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 32 months.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and we issue shares when restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we leased approximately 397,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our office located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 366,000 square feet of office space in 26 other countries around the world, including 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe that the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 20, 2015, the last reported sale price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $77.13 per share, and there were 1,433 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table shows dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	We paid four dividends during 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 19.0 cents per share in 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	See Note 13 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2014 and during the three months ended December 31, 2014 :
1289419_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	_________________________________________________ * Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $700 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P9_S1	The authorization expires on December 31, 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_15_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 20, 2015:
1289419_15_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter, the previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 plans for Cheryl Francis, Steve Kaplan, Jack Noonan, and Richard Robbins completed or expired in accordance with their terms.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares Don will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plan.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2014, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2015 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM5_P12_S3	Don may amend or terminate his Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 include a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P2_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program and dividend payments.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	These cash outflows are offset by proceeds from our revolving credit facility, stock option exercises, and excess tax benefits.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P3_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash provided by financing activities.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P4_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P4_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_15_ITEM6_P5_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	trends in the mutual fund industry, including the increasing popularity of passively managed investment vehicles.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	In 2013, we revised our segment reporting to reflect our shift to a more centralized organizational structure.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We now report our results in a single segment, which is consistent with how management allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Research, through license agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com and newsletters, via subscriptions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P6_S6	In our credit research and rating business, we generate transaction-based revenue for our ratings on new issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our investment management business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	In our Retirement Solutions business, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our Retirement Solutions business also includes plan sponsor and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Advisory Services and Retirement Solutions businesses because our fee structures vary by client.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range could be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	We disclose changes in the services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our SEC filings to the extent that they are material to our consolidated financial results.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Fees for our mutual fund and ETF portfolios generally range from 20 to 40 basis points.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	We charge fees of 40 to 50 basis points for our Select Stock Baskets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result, we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $146.0 million at the end of 2014 and $149.2 million at the end of 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	In recent years, our deferred revenue balance has increased at a more moderate rate, partly because we've been issuing more quarterly and monthly invoices versus up-front, annual invoices.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	In addition, as we ve migrated some Principia subscribers to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other products that meet their needs, we have less subscription-based revenue contributing to the deferred revenue balance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is lower, partly because many of our products and services focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base, which would reduce profitability.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Cost of revenue also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases and data lines as well as development expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing programs to promote our products in this category.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our capital expenditures primarily consist of information technology equipment, leasehold improvements, and capitalized software development costs.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the United States and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We account for our minority-owned investment in Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) using the equity method.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not build long-term shareholder value.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Organic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).
1289419_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate a retention rate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	We use two different methods for calculating retention.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	For subscription-based products (including our print newsletters, Morningstar.com Premium Membership service, and Principia software), we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P29_S6	The retention rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Despite higher volatility and growing investor concerns about global economic growth and the effect of falling oil prices near the end of the year, the U.S. stock market was relatively strong in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year up 12.9%.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Global markets were weaker, though; Morningstar s Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished the year down 3.2%.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The fund industry showed moderate growth in 2014, thanks in part to a generally favorable market.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total U.S. mutual fund assets rose to $15.9 trillion as of December 31, 2014, compared with $15.0 trillion as of December 31, 2013, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Based on Morningstar s analysis of fund flow trends, equity mutual funds had estimated net inflows of about $280 billion in 2014, up from about $220 billion in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios--a trend that was more pronounced in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	In 2014, passively managed vehicles had more than $400 billion in net inflows, compared with only $40 billion net inflows for active products (both mutual funds and ETFs).
1289419_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Actively managed U.S. equity funds had net outflows of nearly $100 billion for the year.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The number of mutual funds in the United States rose slightly to about 7,900 in 2014 (excluding multiple share classes), compared with about 7,700 in 2013 based on ICI data.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The number of global mutual funds rose to about 78,900 as of September 30, 2014, up from about 75,300 as of September 30, 2013, based on ICI data.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2014 with nearly $2 trillion in assets under management based on ICI data, up from about $1.7 trillion as of December 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Based on data from ComScore, aggregate page views to financial and investment sites were down about 6% in 2014, while the number of unique users decreased a similar amount.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The number of pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit both increased modestly.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	For Morningstar.com, metrics such as unique users and aggregate page views both increased for the year.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Amid these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies rose moderately in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Magna Global, a division of Interpublic Group, estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about 17% across all industries in 2014, and we believe advertising spending in the financial services industry also increased versus 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	In addition to industry developments in 2014, there are several longer-term trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Advisors are now required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	Financial advisors are also required to fully disclose and have clients agree on fees for advice and charge separately for any funds or investments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the European Union, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is a set of directives designed to enable funds to operate across the region based upon authorization from one state regulator.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	UCITS IV, which came into effect in July 2011, included requirements for a new Key Investor Information Document (KIID), an easy-to-read annual fact sheet that replaces the Simplified Prospectus.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	We use our data and production capabilities to help fund companies produce and distribute these documents.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its final Technical Advice on MIFID (Market in Financial Instruments Directive) and issued a draft version of regulatory technical and implementing standards, which is currently open for comment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The new regulatory framework would go into effect in January 2017 and aims to ensure that secondary markets are fair, transparent, and safe.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	It also seeks to ensure that investors interests are safeguarded when being sold investment products.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	The main proposals include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	In Australia, the government has continued to implement the series of Future of Financial Advice reforms that began in July 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Several measures that were previously identified for removal were ultimately retained, including requirements relating to annual fee disclosure and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	In response, we believe financial advisors have become more focused on client engagement to demonstrate the value of the services they provide.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	During 2014, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority increased its level of surveillance on superannuation funds (a type of pension plan for employees to use in saving for retirement) with additional quarterly reporting requirements regarding assets held.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	We've expanded our data collection and distribution services to help asset management firms and superannuation funds meet these additional requirements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) into law in July 2010.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Dodd-Frank creates a number of new regulatory, supervisory, and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of U.S. financial markets and activities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Dodd-Frank included a number of corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to publicly traded companies generally.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	It also included changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies granting the SEC more oversight over Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), including our Morningstar Credit Ratings subsidiary.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	While we don't believe Dodd-Frank and related regulations will have a significant effect on other areas of Morningstar, we continue to monitor the potential effect on our clients.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering rules that would impose a fiduciary standard for financial advisors, which would require them to act in the best interest of clients when making investment recommendations instead of the looser suitability standards currently in place.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed a similar plan that would only apply to advisors working with defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	President Obama recently endorsed the DOL proposal and encouraged the DOL to move ahead with new rules that would require a fiduciary standard for financial advisors providing retirement advice.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	We believe the increased regulatory scrutiny of advisors may lead to an expanding need for independent advice, tools, and solutions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Despite generally positive market trends, we believe the business environment for the financial services industry remains challenging.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Asset management firms have been facing increasing regulatory burdens, which are leading to higher costs and more cautious spending in other areas.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Further, the historically low interest rate environment has caused lower margins for some firms, most notably those in the variable annuity space.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	As a result, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from clients in this area.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	(1) Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we changed our reporting to show the number of enterprise clients for Morningstar Advisor Workstation instead of individual licenses.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	We believe this is a better way to capture underlying business trends because per-user pricing varies significantly depending on the scope of the license.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	We also began disclosing the number of licenses for Morningstar Office as a separate line item.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	(2) We no longer offer new Principia subscriptions and are transitioning subscribers to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other Morningstar products.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	(3) We revised our revenue by product structure in 2013 to better represent how management internally reviews and evaluates product revenue and performance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The most significant revision is that Morningstar Data now excludes Morningstar Commodity Data.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	We have reclassified the prior-year information for 2012 to reflect these changes.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	We also made minor corrections to the total number of licenses for Morningstar Direct in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	(4) The decline in assets under advisement reflects difficult market conditions for companies that offer variable annuities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Some of our clients have been managing their funds-of-funds portfolios in-house instead of using outside subadvisors.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Because of this trend, assets under advisement were down $2.5 billion in 2014 and $10.8 billion in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also provide Investment Advisory services for some assets for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Because we don't have custody of the underlying assets, it's difficult for us to quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	(5) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 include a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2014, our consolidated revenue rose 8.9% .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Some of the main contributors to the increase were Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Retirement Solutions, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and Morningstar Credit Ratings.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	Positive results for these products were partially offset by a $9.1 million decline for Principia, as we've been migrating some Principia clients to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other products.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	Revenue for Investment Advisory services was down $2.3 million, reflecting the ongoing effect of clients moving to in-house management for fund-of-funds portfolios in the variable annuity industry.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	In 2013, our consolidated revenue increased 6.1% .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Although our Investment Advisory revenue was down about $7.2 million compared with 2012, most of our other major products performed well.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and Morningstar Retirement Solutions were some of the main contributors to revenue growth in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Investment information products, which make up about 80% of our consolidated revenue, rose $41.4 million , or 7.5% , in 2014 and $29.5 million , or 5.6% , in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Morningstar Direct was the biggest contributor to growth in this product group in both 2014 and 2013, with revenue increasing by $12.5 million in 2014 and $14.1 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to about 10,000 worldwide at the end of 2014, compared with about 8,500 at the end of 2013 and 7,400 at the end of 2012, with strong growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Growth in Morningstar Direct reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Morningstar Advisor Workstation was the second-largest contributor to growth in this product group in 2014 with an additional $8.6 million of revenue, mainly reflecting additional enterprise clients.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	These positive growth trends were offset by lower revenue for Principia, which was down $9.1 million in 2014 and $4.8 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	We're no longer selling new subscriptions to Principia, and we ve been transitioning some Principia subscribers to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other Morningstar products that meet their needs.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Revenue for Morningstar Credit Ratings rose $8.4 million, reflecting both higher industry-wide new issuance volume in structured credits and growth in our market share for CMBS new-issue ratings versus other rating agencies.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Revenue for Morningstar Data increased $8.1 million, reflecting strong renewal rates and new client contracts for managed products data.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Investment management revenue, which represents about 20% of consolidated revenue, was up $20.4 million , or 14.3% , in 2014, driven by higher revenue for Morningstar Retirement Solutions and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Revenue for Morningstar Retirement Solutions was up $11.7 million year over year, reflecting strong asset growth from both new and existing clients.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	Revenue for Morningstar Managed Portfolios increased $8.5 million, driven by net inflows and positive market returns over the past 12 months.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Companies that offer variable annuities have continued to face difficult market conditions, which has prompted some of our clients to begin managing their fund-of-funds portfolios in-house instead of using outside subadvisors.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Because of this trend, revenue for our Investment Advisory services was down about $2.3 million year over year, and assets under advisement were down $2.5 billion over the same period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Because the variable annuity industry, which accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated revenue in 2014 and 2013, continues to face challenges, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from variable annuity clients.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Investment management revenue increased $10.5 million , or 7.9% , in 2013 as positive trends in assets under management for Retirement Solutions and Morningstar Managed Portfolios more than offset lower revenue for Investment Advisory services.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our Investment Advisory revenue was about $7.2 million lower in 2013 versus 2012, and assets under advisement for these services were down $10.8 billion over the same period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The asset-based fees we earn are generally based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $166.3 billion in 2014, compared with $161.6 billion in 2013 and $181.0 billion in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	We had $94.1 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2014 , an increase of $5.5 million compared with $88.6 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	In 2012 , revenue from asset-based fees was $81.4 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 12.4% of consolidated revenue in 2014 , down slightly from 12.7% in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	To make it easier to compare our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	In April 2014, we acquired ByAllAccounts, Inc. (ByAllAccounts) and in June 2014, we acquired an additional 81.3% interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. (HelloWallet) to become the sole owner.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	During the second quarter of 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB to become the sole owner.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2014, we had $11.4 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	In addition, currency translations reduced revenue by about $2.5 million in 2014, mainly because of the weaker Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the stronger British pound.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 7.6% in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	In 2013, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures was essentially neutral, as we had $3.7 million in incremental revenue from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Morningstar Sweden, which was offset by the loss of $4.1 million in revenue from business lines we divested in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	In addition, currency translations reduced revenue by about $3.6 million in 2013, mainly because of the weaker Australian dollar.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 6.7% in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	International revenue made up about 28% of our consolidated revenue in 2014, 2013, and 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Revenue from international operations rose 6.0% in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations, revenue from international operations increased 6.2%.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our operations in Continental Europe were the main contributors to the increase, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	In 2013, revenue from international operations rose 3.2% , as our operations in Continental Europe enjoyed stronger product sales, but this growth was partly offset by negative currency movements (mainly the weaker Australian dollar).
1289419_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data, Investment Advisory services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 95% in 2014, compared with 94% in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Many of our products have shown positive trends in renewal rates over the past three years, which was partially offset by lower renewals for variable annuity clients for Investment Advisory services.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	In 2014, we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products, such as Principia, Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, and print and online newsletters, was approximately 69% in 2014, down from 71% in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The decline was mainly driven by subscription losses from Principia.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Note: Following our change to a more centralized structure during 2013, we refined the classification of employees within operating expense categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	As a result, approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue starting in the second half of 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	These changes added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue in 2014 versus 2013 as well as in 2013 versus 2012, and reduced the compensation expense included in the sales and marketing and general and administrative categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million in each of these periods, respectively.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	These changes did not affect total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	In 2014, our operating expense was up $126.9 million , or 24.0% .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	We settled a dispute with Business Logic during the second quarter of 2014 for $61.0 million, which contributed nearly half of this increase.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Higher compensation expense (including salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) also contributed to the change.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We had approximately 3,760 employees worldwide at the end of 2014, compared with 3,565 at the end of 2013--an increase of approximately 200 employees.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	About half of the change reflects new employees added with the ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet acquisitions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	We also added product and technology roles in the United States as well as equity data analysts in India.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Commission expense rose $10.0 million in 2014, mainly because we changed to a new sales commission structure that requires a different accounting treatment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	We now expense commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the term of the underlying contracts.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	However, we continued to amortize the prepaid commission balance from our previous commission plan during 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Depreciation expense was up $8.4 million in 2014, mainly reflecting additional capitalized software development and computer software purchases for our U.S. operations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Production expense was up $6.7 million in 2014, mainly reflecting higher costs for information technology maintenance agreements and infrastructure, as well as an unrealized loss on some of our model portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	This expense growth was partially offset by an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	In 2014, we capitalized $18.8 million of software development costs for ongoing enhancements as well as new development of upgraded software platforms, compared with $8.1 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	In 2013, our operating expense was up $20.0 million , or 3.9% , mainly because of higher salary expense, depreciation expense, professional fees, and bonus expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	Salary expense rose $6.3 million for the year, primarily because of pay raises made in July 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	In addition, while headcount was down in the first nine months of the year, we hired about 75 net new employees during the fourth quarter.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	By the end of 2013, we had about 3,565 employees worldwide, compared with 3,495 at the end of 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Depreciation expense increased $5.1 million during 2013, mainly reflecting additional capitalized software development and computer software purchases for our U.S. operations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Professional fees were up $5.0 million in 2013, primarily reflecting higher legal expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	Total operating expense also includes bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense, which we include in each of the cost categories shown in the table above.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Bonus expense was $48.1 million in 2014, compared with $40.9 million in 2013 and $36.2 million in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Stock-based compensation expense was $17.6 million in 2014, compared with $15.0 million in 2013 and $18.9 million in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Overall, operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased 10.5 percentage points in 2014, mainly because of the $61.0 million litigation settlement expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Operating expense as a percentage of revenue was down 1.5 percentage points in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	In both 2014 and 2013, the $14 million of additional expense from the shift in employee cost categories discussed above was a major factor behind the growth in cost of revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	In 2014, other increases in salary expense, bonus, and other compensation costs--which totaled about $44.4 million--also contributed to growth in this category.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	Production expense was up $6.7 million in 2014, mainly reflecting higher costs for information technology maintenance agreements and infrastructure, as well as an unrealized loss on some of our model portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	These increases were partially offset by a higher level of capitalized software development in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	We capitalized $18.8 million of software development in 2014, compared with $8.1 million in 2013 and $8.5 million in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased by about 3.0 percentage points in 2014 and 1.4 percentage points in 2013, with approximately 2 percentage points of the change in both years driven by the shift in expense categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	As discussed above, the shift in employee cost categories reduced sales and marketing expense by approximately $8 million in both 2014 and 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	Despite this reduction, total sales and marketing expense was still up $7.5 million in 2014, mainly because of higher sales commission costs following the change in commission plan discussed above.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	Additional costs for advertising and marketing also contributed to this increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P103_S3	This expense growth was partly offset by lower costs for travel, training, and conferences.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	Sales and marketing expense was down $5.3 million in 2013, mainly driven by the shift in expense categories discussed above.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Higher sales commissions of $2.6 million partly offset this decrease.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down 0.2 percentage points in 2014 and 1.7 percentage points in 2013, mainly because of the shift in expense categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	The shift in employee cost categories discussed above reduced general and administrative (G A) expense by approximately $6 million in both 2014 and 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	Despite this reduction, total G A expense still increased by $2.0 million in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	Rent and facilities costs were up $2.8 million versus 2013, mainly because we expanded our office space in the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	This additional expense was partially offset by a $1.5 million credit we recorded for damages received in connection with a legal matter in the first quarter of 2014, which partially offset growth in legal and other professional fees.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	G A expense was down $2.0 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	There were three main items that contributed to the decline.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	First, G A expense in 2012 included $3.2 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to a former executive in a business we acquired.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	This expense did not recur in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	Second, we had an additional $1.6 million of combined expense in 2012 for an impairment charge for one of our smaller products and a litigation settlement.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	This expense did not recur in 2013, either.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P109_S4	Third, the shift in expense categories discussed above partially offset growth in salary, benefits, and other compensation expense.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Higher professional fees of $3.6 million partially offset the decline in G A expense in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	In addition, our 2012 results included a benefit of approximately $1.0 million for the resolution of a prior-year business tax expense matter.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	This benefit did not recur in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	G A expense as a percentage of revenue was down 1.0 percentage points in 2014 and 1.2 percentage points in 2013, mainly because of the shift in expense categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Intangible amortization expense increased $0.8 million in 2014 and $2.5 million in 2013, as additional amortization expense for the intangible assets of HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts was largely offset by the completed amortization of intangible assets from some previous acquisitions .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	However, depreciation expense rose $8.4 million in 2014, mainly because of higher capital expenditures for computer software and a higher level of capitalized software development for our operations in the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	Depreciation expense increased $5.1 million in 2013, mainly because of additions to capitalized software development and purchases of computer software.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining lives of the assets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	We estimate that this expense will total approximately $21.9 million in 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, dispositions, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and currency translations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Overall, depreciation and amortization increased $9.2 million in 2014 and $2.6 million in 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	We recorded a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense in the second quarter of 2014 related to our agreement with Business Logic.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	This settlement contributed nearly half of the increase in operating expense in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Consolidated operating income decreased $65.1 million in 2014 as our revenue increased $61.8 million and operating expense rose by $126.9 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Operating margin was 13.9% , a decrease of 10.5 percentage points compared with 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	The $61.0 million settlement was the biggest contributor to the decline in operating income and operating margin in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	We also had higher salary and other compensation-related expense from additional headcount, reflecting both new hires and employees added with the ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet acquisitions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	Excluding the settlement, we reported adjusted operating income of $166.6 million in 2014, a decrease of 2.4% compared with 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure; the table below shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	We present adjusted operating income (operating income excluding the settlement) to show the effect of this charge, better reflect period-over-period comparisons, and improve overall understanding of our current and future financial performance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Excluding the settlement, we reported an adjusted operating margin of 21.9% in 2014, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure; the table below shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	We present adjusted operating margin (operating margin excluding the settlement) to show the effect of this charge, better reflect period-over-period comparisons, and improve overall understanding of our current and future financial performance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	In 2013, consolidated operating income rose $20.0 million , and our margin was up 1.5 percentage points as revenue growth of $40.0 million outpaced expense growth of $20.0 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Lower salary expense as a percentage of revenue contributed approximately 1.0 percentage points to the operating margin improvement in 2013; lower stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization expense as a percentage of revenue also had favorable effects of 0.7 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points, respectively.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	Partially offsetting these improvements, professional fees and depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue were both up 0.6 percentage points, and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue rose 0.4 percentage points.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table presents the components of non-operating income, net:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	The 2014 increase in interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance on the credit facility we established in the third quarter of 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	The decrease in interest income in 2013 reflects lower balances of cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P125_S3	Interest income in 2012 also included approximately $0.7 million of interest income related to the business tax refund for prior years recorded in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	Non-operating income in 2014 includes the $5.2 million gain we recorded with our purchase of the remaining ownership interest in HelloWallet, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	Non-operating income in 2013 includes the $3.6 million gain we recorded with our purchase of the remaining ownership interest in Morningstar Sweden, which was also previously a minority investment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Other income (expense), net includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our U.S. and non-U.S. operations and royalty income from MJKK.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	In 2012, other expense, net included a $2.0 million loss on the sale of our investment in Bundle Corporation.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities mainly consists of our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK), YCharts, Inc., and Inquiry Financial Europe AB.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	In 2012 and the first four months of 2013, this category also included our portion of the net income (loss) of Morningstar Sweden.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	In May 2013, we acquired the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden for $14.6 million in cash, increasing our ownership interest to become the sole owner.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P128_S3	Because Morningstar Sweden is now a wholly owned subsidiary, we no longer account for our investment using the equity method.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities is primarily from our position in MJKK.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	The $1.4 million decrease in 2014 reflects an impairment charge for our ownership interest in a smaller unconsolidated entity.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2014 was 31.3% , almost exactly at par with 2013, when we provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 31.2% .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2013 was 31.2% , a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared with 33.9% in 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	The decrease mainly reflects adjustments to certain deferred income tax benefits and the recognition of additional tax credits and incentives.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P135_S2	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P135_S3	We invest a portion of our investments balance (approximately $21.5 million, or 54% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2014 ) in proprietary Morningstar portfolios, exchange-traded funds that seek to track the performance of certain Morningstar proprietary indexes, and various mutual funds.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P135_S4	These portfolios may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Approximately 28% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2014 was held by our operations in the United States, down from about 51% as of December 31, 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	We do not expect to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	We have not recognized deferred tax liabilities for the portion of the outside basis differences (including unremitted earnings) relating to foreign subsidiaries because the investment in these subsidiaries is considered to be permanent in duration.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	Quantification of the deferred tax liability associated with these outside basis differences is not practicable.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	In 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $132.2 million , driven by $143.6 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by $11.4 million in changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $224.6 million , a decrease of $74.0 million compared with $298.6 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	The reduction reflects $76.7 million used to repurchase common stock through our share repurchase program, $64.4 million used for the acquisitions of ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet, $61.0 million for the Business Logic settlement, $58.3 million of capital expenditures, and bonus payments of $39.8 million made during the first quarter of 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	These outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities and the $30.0 million drawn on the credit facility described below.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	In July 2014, we established a $75.0 million single-bank revolving credit facility in the United States, which we intend to use for general corporate purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	We drew on this credit facility during the third quarter of 2014 and had an outstanding principal balance of $30.0 million as of December 31, 2014 at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points, leaving borrowing availability of $45.0 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	In 2014 , we also paid dividends of $30.5 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	In February 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P141_S2	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2015 to shareholders of record as of April 10, 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P141_S3	We expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 19 cents per share in 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	In December 2013, our board of directors approved a $200.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $700.0 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	We may repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P142_S2	In 2014, we repurchased a total of approximately 1.1 million shares for $76.7 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P142_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , we have repurchased a total of 8.1 million shares for $526.5 million since we announced the share repurchase program in September 2010.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	We expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2015, primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	We also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2015 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $48.0 million related to the 2014 bonus.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P145_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	We generated positive free cash flow of $73.9 million in 2014, a decrease of $79.2 million versus 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	Free cash flow was down largely because of the $61.0 million payment in connection with our litigation settlement, as well as an increase in capital expenditures in 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P147_S2	In 2013, free cash flow was up $37.1 million from 2012, reflecting higher cash provided by operating activities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	We invested a total of $75.5 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P148_S1	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	We sold two businesses in 2012 and received a total of $6.7 million related to these sales.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P149_S1	For more information, please see Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	See Note 18 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on events subsequent to December 31, 2014 .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P151_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 3 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P153_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P153_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P153_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P153_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for publications, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	We also provide analysis, investment advisory, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P155_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P158_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P159_S1	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , our deferred revenue was $146.0 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S3	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S4	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P160_S5	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P161_S3	On occasion we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation experts for significant assets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P164_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and non-compete agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P165_S1	These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S4	We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S5	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S6	We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P166_S7	If we determine that goodwill is impaired, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash-flow methodology.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for businesses and determination of weighted average cost of capital.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P167_S2	We believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations in connection with acquisitions and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	Under FASB ASC 718 , Compensation Stock Compensation , we measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S3	We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S4	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P169_S5	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	We believe the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P172_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P173_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_15_ITEM7_P173_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P173_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P173_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P174_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $46.4 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $56.7 million .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	The deferred tax assets include $7.7 million of deferred tax assets related to $37.9 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.1 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P177_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P177_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	We assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 , Income Taxes.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S1	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S2	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S3	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P178_S5	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P180_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P182_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P182_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P183_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P183_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P183_S3	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	(2) The 2015 minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $30 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P187_S1	Only the interest and commitment fees are mandatory payments during 2015, as we anticipate renewing the one-year revolving credit facility in July 2015 and any outstanding principal balance at that time.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits) recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_15_ITEM7_P188_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM7_P188_S2	The table excludes $6.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We invest our investment portfolio mainly in proprietary Morningstar portfolios and exchange-traded funds based on some of our proprietary indexes, as well as various mutual funds.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $224.6 million.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The table below shows our exposure to foreign currency denominated revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014:
1289419_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our exposure to net investment in foreign currencies for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented in the following table:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) , and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Morningstar Inc. s internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.: We have audited Morningstar Inc. s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Morningstar, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and the financial statement schedule and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and accompanying schedule.

1289419_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Morningstar, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Morningstar, we, our), provides independent investment research for investors around the world.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	In 2014, we identified and corrected an immaterial classification error related to the current and long-term balance for deferred rent included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	The correcting entries had the effect of decreasing accounts payable and accrued liabilities by $10.7 million and increasing deferred rent (long-term) by the same amount.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	The financial statements have been corrected to reduce the current balance and increase the long-term balance as shown in the table below:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conduct our business operations through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	We consolidate assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	In accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, we present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in two separate but consecutive statements, our Consolidated Statements of Income and separately, our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	In addition, effective January 1, 2013, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2013-2, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	We show the effects of items reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement along with net income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Certain amounts reported in 2012 have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Separately, as a result of our move to a more centralized structure in 2013 (including new positions created, changes in focus for some existing roles, and the refinement of employee cost categorizations as we moved to a more centralized structure), approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	These changes added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue in 2014 versus 2013 as well as in 2013 versus 2012, and reduced the compensation expense included in the sales and marketing and general and administrative categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million in each of these periods, respectively.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	These changes did not affect total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	We state the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds at fair value, as these funds are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of fixed-income securities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in GAAP and IFRS .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, amends certain fair value measurement principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 7 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	We include capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The table below summarizes our capitalized software development costs for the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their full fair values as of the date we obtain control, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S4	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P40_S5	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , on the acquisition date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P41_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2014, 2013, and 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2014, 2013, and 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	We did not record any impairment losses in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Delivery of our products and services has taken place.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, Premium Membership subscriptions for Morningstar.com, our structured credit research and ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	For new-issue ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS), we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Our Investment Advisory business includes a broad range of services.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Pricing for consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service provided, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Our Retirement Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	For our Retirement Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The revenue arrangements for Retirement Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements combine multiple products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of licenses or subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided, which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and stock options.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	For stock options, we estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, Morningstar's full-time employees are generally eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P65_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave and include this liability in Accrued Compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding mainly reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	We further compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P73_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	In July 2014, we entered into a one year, $75.0 million , single-bank revolving credit facility.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	We drew on the credit facility during 2014 and had an outstanding principal balance of $30.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points as of December 31, 2014, leaving borrowing availability of $45.0 million .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following table shows the number of weighted average stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share awards excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share from both continuing operations and net earnings because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Stock options and restricted stock could be included in the calculation in the future.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	We report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 3 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	We evaluate the performance of our reporting segment based on revenue and operating income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	We derive revenue from two product groups.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	The investment information product group includes all of our data, software, and research products and services.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	These products are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	The investment management product group includes all of our asset management operations, which earn the majority of their revenue from asset-based fees.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The table below summarizes our revenue by product group:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The tables below summarize our revenue and long-lived assets by geographical area:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	Our investment portfolio is primarily invested in proprietary Morningstar portfolios, exchange-traded funds that seek to track the performance of certain Morningstar proprietary indexes, and various mutual funds.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	We classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , held-to-maturity investments included a $1.5 million certificate of deposit, held primarily as collateral against bank guarantees for our office leases, primarily in Australia.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	The table below shows the fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the fair value hierarchy and the necessary disclosures under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement :
1289419_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting each of these investment categories in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	There were no transfers between levels one and two during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, mutual funds, equity securities, and exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from observable market data.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Increased Ownership Interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	In June 2014, we acquired an additional 81.3% interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. (HelloWallet), increasing our ownership to 100% from 18.7% .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	HelloWallet combines behavioral economics and the psychology of decision-making with sophisticated technology to provide personalized, unbiased financial guidance to U.S. workers and their families through their employer benefit plans.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on June 3, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	HelloWallet's total preliminary estimated fair value of $54,006,000 includes $40,525,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 81.3% interest in HelloWallet and pay off HelloWallet's indebtedness as well as $13,481,000 related to the 18.7% of HelloWallet we previously held.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	We recorded a preliminary non-cash holding gain of $5,168,000 for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held investment.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	The gain is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The purchase price valuation will be finalized upon the completion of the fair value analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	We have not yet obtained all of the information related to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities to finalize the purchase price allocation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The primary area that is not yet finalized relates to income taxes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, all of which are preliminary pending completion of the final valuation:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	The preliminary allocation includes $9,460,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	We recognized a preliminary deferred tax liability of $3,595,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	The fair value of the acquired intangible assets and the deferred tax liability are preliminary pending receipt of the final valuation for these assets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	We recognized a preliminary deferred tax asset of $8,646,000 mainly because of net operating losses of HelloWallet which will become available to Morningstar.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Preliminary goodwill of $39,166,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to bring together HelloWallet's comprehensive financial wellness expertise with Morningstar's independent, research-based retirement advice to create a holistic retirement savings and advice offering.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	In April 2014, we acquired ByAllAccounts, Inc. (ByAllAccounts), a provider of innovative data aggregation technology for financial applications for $27,949,000 in cash.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	ByAllAccounts uses a knowledge-based process, including patented artificial intelligence technology, to collect, consolidate, and enrich financial account data and deliver it to virtually any platform.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 1, 2014.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	The purchase price valuation will be finalized upon the completion of the fair value analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	We have not yet obtained all of the information related to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities to finalize the purchase price allocation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	The primary area that is not yet finalized relates to income taxes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition, all of which are preliminary pending completion of the final valuation:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The preliminary allocation includes $8,681,000 of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	We recognized a preliminary deferred tax liability of $3,299,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	The fair value of the acquired intangible assets and the deferred tax liability are preliminary pending receipt of the final valuation for these intangible assets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	We recognized a preliminary deferred tax asset of $3,987,000 mainly because of net operating losses of ByAllAccounts which will become available to Morningstar.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Preliminary goodwill value of $18,476,000 represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to integrate the service into our offerings as well as expand and develop ByAllAccounts' third-party distribution relationships.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	In May 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB (Morningstar Sweden), increasing our ownership to 100% from 24% .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Morningstar s main offerings in Sweden include Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Enterprise Components (formerly Integrated Web Tools), and Morningstar.se, a website for individual investors.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 2, 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Morningstar Sweden's total estimated fair value of $18,513,000 included $14,554,000 in cash paid to acquire the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden and $3,959,000 related to the 24% of Morningstar Sweden we previously held.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 24% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest by applying a minority interest discount based on analysis of comparable transactions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P123_S2	Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash holding gain of $3,635,000 , which is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	The allocation included acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $2,272,000 mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Goodwill of $8,911,000 represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P127_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer Morningstar's full suite of products and services to investors in Sweden and further leverage Morningstar's global reach, investment databases, and technology expertise.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 :
1289419_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	We did not record any significant impairment losses in 2014 , 2013 , or 2012 , as the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.

1289419_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	Our shareholders approved the Morningstar 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) on May 17, 2011.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	As of that date we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).
1289419_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	The 2004 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Morningstar 2000 Stock Option Plan, and the Morningstar 2001 Stock Option Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P154_S1	The 2011 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including, among other things, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and stock options.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	We granted restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options under the 2004 Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P155_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P155_S3	Any shares subject to awards under the 2011 Plan, but not under the 2004 Plan, that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P155_S4	The following table summarizes the number of shares available for future grants under our 2011 Plan:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit we recorded in the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense included in each of our operating expense categories for the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2014 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	Our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense annually in the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P161_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P161_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P161_S3	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P162_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	In conjunction with the 2010 Realpoint acquisition, we issued shares of restricted stock to the selling employee-shareholders which vest ratably over a five-year period from the acquisition date and may be subject to forfeiture if the holder terminates his or her employment during the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	In 2014, we granted executive officers, other than Joe Mansueto, performance share awards pursuant to which each executive becomes entitled to a number of shares of Morningstar common stock equal to the number of notional performance shares that become vested.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P165_S1	Each award specifies a number of performance shares that will vest if we attain pre-established target performance goals.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P165_S2	The number of performance shares that actually vest may be more or less than the specified number of performance shares based on our performance relative to the target performance goals over a three-year period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	We base the grant date fair value for these awards on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to the grant date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P166_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, based on the satisfaction of the performance condition that is most likely to be satisfied over the three-year service period ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	Information as of December 31, 2014 regarding our target performance share awards granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for performance share awards granted during 2014 is as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	(1) Represents the closing market price of Morningstar's stock on March 14, 2014, which is the last closing price prior to the grant date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four-year period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P169_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	Almost all of the options granted under the 2004 Plan have a premium feature in which the exercise price increases over the term of the option at a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield as of the date of grant.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	Options granted under the 2011 Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P171_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P171_S2	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P171_S3	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2014 :
1289419_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2014 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P175_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $64.71 on that date.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return that exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P176_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P177_S1	In 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P179_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P183_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	The year-over-year increase in U.S. federal NOL carryforward mainly reflects the two acquisitions we completed in 2014, as both HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts were startup companies that accumulated losses in their early stages of operation.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	The decrease in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards in our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $118,600,000 as of December 31, 2014 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P190_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5,127,000 of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P191_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P191_S3	In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally extends to years prior to 2005.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P192_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $5,124,000 and a non-current liability of $6,608,000 for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P194_S1	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	In 2014 , we recorded a net increase of $2,818,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $2,818,000 increased our income tax expense by $2,572,000 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P196_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $3,855,000 for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $1,455,000 decreased our income tax expense by $1,269,000 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $11,922,000 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $11,922,000 , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $10,565,000 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P198_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	We recorded the decrease in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2014 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P200_S1	Although the outcome of a particular proceeding can never be predicted, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $700 million in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	The authorization expires on December 31, 2015.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had repurchased a total of 8,142,010 shares for $526.5 million under this authorization, leaving approximately $173.5 million available for future repurchases.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	In February 2015 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	The dividend is payable on April 30, 2015 to shareholders of record as of April 10, 2015 .
1289419_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P205_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P205_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P205_S3	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We design disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2014 .
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, participated in and supervised this evaluation.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act meets the requirements listed above.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 .
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and incorporated herein by reference.
1289419_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_15_ITEM9B_P0_S0	There is no information that was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that was not reported.

1289419_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Morningstar is a leading provider of independent investment research in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We offer an extensive line of data, software, research, and investment management offerings for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	In addition to our U.S.-based products and services, we offer local versions of our products designed for investors in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Morningstar serves approximately 250,000 financial advisors, 1,300 asset management firms, 28 retirement plan providers, 300,000 retirement plan sponsors, and 10.1 million individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our data and research are core assets that we seek to leverage to build Morningstar's long-term value.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we provided extensive data on more than 500,000 investments, including mutual funds, stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, separate accounts, and variable annuities.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	We also track real-time market data on more than 17 million exchange-traded equities, derivatives, commodities, currencies, and other investments.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our data and proprietary analytical tools such as the Morningstar Rating for mutual funds, which rates past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, and the Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund's underlying investment style, have become important tools that millions of investors and advisors use in making investment decisions.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	We've created other tools, such as the Ownership Zone, Sector Delta, and Market Barometer, which allow investors to see how different investments work together to form a portfolio and to track its progress.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our popular Portfolio X-Ray tool helps investors evaluate their portfolios and get a clear view of their underlying holdings.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	We ve been providing independent analyst research on mutual funds and other investment vehicles since the mid-1980s.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	We use this analyst research to provide a qualitative, forward-looking Morningstar Analyst Rating for funds.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	We now provide research reports and Morningstar Analyst Ratings for approximately 4,600 funds globally, including active, passive, multi-asset, ETF, and closed-end fund strategies.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	We also offer qualitative research and ratings on alternative funds, state-sponsored college savings plan portfolios, and target-date funds.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 2015, we announced plans to launch the industry's first sustainable investing metrics for global mutual funds and ETFs.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our new metrics are based on company-level ratings and research from Sustainalytics, a leading provider of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and corporate governance ratings and research.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	We have a long tradition of innovative research centered on good stewardship, lower costs, and more transparency for investors and want to bring even greater transparency and accountability to the investment industry with information about sustainability, while helping investors to put their money to work in ways that are meaningful to them.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	As part of our research efforts on individual stocks, we popularized the concepts of economic moat, a measure of competitive advantage originally developed by Warren Buffett, and margin of safety, which reflects the size of the discount in a stock's price relative to its estimated value.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	We offer a variety of other qualitative measures such as Stewardship Grades, which help investors identify companies and fund firms that have demonstrated a high level of commitment to shareholders and stewardship of investors' capital.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our analysts cover approximately 1,500 stocks, using a consistent, proprietary methodology that focuses on fundamental analysis, competitive advantage assessment, and intrinsic value estimation.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	In July 2015, we received the Thought Leadership award at the Investment Week Investment Marketing and Innovation Awards in London for our independent equity research drawing on our economic moat methodology.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	In addition to our analyst-driven coverage, we provide quantitative ratings and reports for approximately 40,000 companies globally.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	These equity ratings draw on the fundamental research of our equity analyst team and provide a forward-looking statistical view of the valuation, competitive advantage, and level of uncertainty for stocks that are often under-followed by other research firms.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Through our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary, which is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), we provide new issue and surveillance ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as well as operational risk assessment services.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition, we publish credit ratings and associated research on corporate debt issuers.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We currently provide ratings on about 400 issuers.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Morningstar, Inc. is not currently an NRSRO, and our credit ratings on corporate issuers are not NRSRO credit ratings.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	In our investment management business, we've developed in-depth advice on asset allocation, portfolio construction, and security selection to meet the needs of investors and professionals looking for integrated portfolio solutions.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	We ve published research on "Gamma," an innovative measure that quantifies how much additional retirement income investors can generate by making better financial planning decisions.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	We use the concept of human capital or potential future earning ability to provide a more complete picture of an investor s financial worth and optimize a portfolio s asset mix.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	In 2015, we launched the Global Market Barometer, which delivers our global family of indexes through a signature visual to help investors identify market trends and opportunities.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We introduced our Signature Asset Library, a set of curated, interactive components that bring together Morningstar s strength in research, data, data visualization, design, and technology.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	We offer these components through a variety of products to help users gain insights into our rich data sets.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe investors rely on these tools because they offer a useful framework for comparing potential investments and making decisions.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our strategy is to widen our economic moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, and build shareholder value by focusing on our three key objectives, which we describe in more detail below.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our investment data, research, and ratings are at the heart of our strategy, allowing us to help investors achieve better investment outcomes whether they make their own investment decisions or outsource management of their portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	1. Produce the most effective investment data, research, and ratings to help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe our leadership position in independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our goal is to leverage our proprietary research and intellectual property to help investors with both decision support (via Morningstar Direct) and outsourced investment management (via our investment management business).
1289419_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We re focusing our research efforts on several different areas, as described below.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our goal for manager research is to leverage our leadership position to reach additional customer groups.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	In contrast to most other companies, we also integrate manager research with our software, which we believe is another competitive advantage.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had 115 manager research analysts globally, including teams in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our equity research complements our approach to manager research, where we focus on analyzing the individual stocks that make up each fund's portfolio.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had more than 100 equity analysts globally, making us one of the largest providers of independent equity research.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe our analysts long-term approach, deep industry knowledge, and focus on sustainable competitive advantage are important factors that set us apart and help investors achieve better investment outcomes.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC, our structured credit research and ratings subsidiary, is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) that has earned a reputation for innovation and excellence in the structured finance market.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Morningstar Credit Ratings has submitted a preliminary application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expand its NRSRO license to include credit ratings for corporate bonds and financial institutions.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	We re seeking to expand the license because we believe we can make a difference in the market by bringing transparency, unique perspectives, and superior client service to all investors across the fixed-income markets.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Over the past several years, we ve developed new research tools that provide a more holistic approach to investing and asset allocation.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Whereas traditional asset allocation methodologies focus solely on financial assets (such as stocks and bonds), we ve developed methodologies that provide a more complete view of all sources of wealth, including financial capital, human capital, housing assets, and retirement and pension benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Develop Morningstar Direct as our flagship decision support platform.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2015, we began rolling out the next-generation version of Morningstar Direct, our institutional investment research platform.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The new software is designed to be more intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	It provides a more consistent, cohesive experience with a strong emphasis on Morningstar s proprietary research and tools.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	We also improved the underlying technology, including a more streamlined development process for commonly used Morningstar capabilities such as portfolio management tools.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	The new software is fully web-based, which eliminates the need for desktop software installations and allows immediate access to new features.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	It allows to us innovate more rapidly and more easily configure our software solutions to meet client needs.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	It also addresses the growing need for mobile-optimized capabilities to extend the desktop experience onto mobile devices.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Over time, we expect to migrate many of our core software capabilities to Morningstar Direct, which will serve as our main platform for clients looking for information to support the investment decisions they make on their own or validate investment recommendations from another party.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	We also plan to expand the user base for Morningstar Direct by enhancing workflow capabilities for our existing clients and adding workflows for new types of clients, such as financial advisors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	3. Build world-class investment management solutions based on our proprietary research.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	We leverage our innovative, proprietary research by building world-class investment management solutions that help investors achieve better outcomes.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our goal is to connect our existing capabilities to create holistic solutions that help financial advisors, asset managers, and individual investors with portfolio construction, monitoring, security selection, and implementation.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our investment management solutions include Investment Advisory services, which had $77.8 billion in assets under advisement as of December 31, 2015, and Workplace Solutions (formerly Retirement Solutions), which had a total of $89.7 billion in assets under management and advisement.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	For financial advisors, we offer Morningstar Managed Portfolios, a fee-based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund, ETF, and stock portfolios tailored to meet specific investment time horizons and risk levels.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we managed $12.9 billion in assets through this service.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We also expect to expand the investment management solutions we offer through our index business.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	We currently offer more than 300 investment indexes that can be used for both benchmarking and product creation.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Given the core capabilities discussed above, we're focusing on four primary customer groups:
1289419_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	This customer group includes independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker-dealers, dually registered advisors, and captive advisors who are employees of a broker-dealer.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Captive broker-dealers include wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, and banks.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In total, Cerulli Associates estimates there were approximately 300,000 financial advisors in the United States as of the end of 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We believe our deep understanding of individual investors needs allows us to work with advisors to help them make more efficient use of their time and deliver better investment outcomes for their clients.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our advisor solutions also draw on Morningstar s proprietary investment research methodologies and research insights.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We're expanding the range of services we offer to help financial advisors with all aspects of their daily workflow needs, including investment decision-making, portfolio construction, client monitoring and reporting, practice management, portfolio rebalancing that connects with custodial and trading interfaces, and financial planning.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Because advisors are increasingly outsourcing investment management, we're continuing to enhance Morningstar Managed Portfolios to help advisors save time and reduce compliance risk.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	We also plan to integrate our investment management solutions with our advisor software to deliver a comprehensive investment platform, focusing on the needs of independent registered investment advisors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	With our November 2015 acquisition of Total Rebalance Expert (tRx), we added automated, tax-efficient portfolio rebalancing capabilities for advisors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, we plan to build advisory solutions that incorporate both retirement and non-retirement assets.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our main products for financial advisors are Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office) and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Asset management firms manage and distribute investment portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We estimate that there are more than 3,000 asset management firms globally, ranging from large, global firms to firms with small fund lineups and operations in a single market or region.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, and distribution, as well as investment management (often referred to as the buy side ), which includes portfolio management, research, and securities analysis.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our asset management offerings help companies connect with their clients because of Morningstar s strong brand presence with both financial advisors and individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	We offer a global reach and have earned investors trust in our unbiased approach, investor-centric mission, and thought leadership.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our goal is to expand the number of asset management firms and individuals at these firms who employ Morningstar s research offerings to help them achieve better results for their clients.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	We also plan to leverage our proprietary research and data to continue developing differentiated software and data offerings.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	The key products we offer for asset management firms include Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Indexes.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	For the buy side, key products include Morningstar Research, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	In the workplace (also known as retirement) market, millions of investors are now charged with planning for their own retirement, mainly through self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k) plans in the United States.

1289419_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, we believe individual investors, financial advisors, employers, and government organizations have all become more aware of the need for advice and guidance that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond.

1289419_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	In addition to trademarks, we currently hold several patents in the United States, including patents held by Morningstar Investment Management LLC for lifetime asset allocation and asset allocation with annuities.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	We license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers for a fee.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P121_S1	We generally use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with most of our larger operating companies.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P122_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to market our products and develop and sell country-specific variants of products under the Morningstar name in their operating territories.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and recording it based on information found in public filings.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P124_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P124_S2	We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P124_S3	This tends to offset most of the seasonality in our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.

1289419_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, technology, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P129_S1	We strive to adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P129_S2	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_16_ITEM1_P129_S3	This allows us to control our technology development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.

1289419_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, because these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options.

1289419_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Problems could arise if these programs assigned retirement plan participants to the wrong portfolios, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Clients may take legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty, or based on our investment management fees and expenses.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on approximately $180 billion in assets as of December 31, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We believe independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as any negative publicity or media reports about Morningstar, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation and damage our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We offer products and services to institutional clients, which include banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, media outlets, and retirement plan providers and sponsors.

1289419_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In some cases, we make investment recommendations (such as Select Lists) within the framework of client constraints.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	While we don t charge asset management firms for their products to be rated, we do charge licensing fees for the use of our ratings.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also receive payments from issuers for our new-issue ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These payments may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to produce competitive performance in our investment management offerings.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 30 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	More recently, we ve developed unique concepts and tools such as the Wealth Forecasting Engine, Gamma, and Total Wealth Approach.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We believe these innovations set us apart because most of our competitors focus on providing data or software rather than creating their own proprietary research frameworks.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also believe our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools is at the core of what drives Morningstar s value for all of our customer groups.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we fail to continuously fuel our innovation engine and develop new tools to meet the needs of our customers, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we re perceived as not moving quickly enough to meet the changing needs of investors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain attention from our clients.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Smaller companies, including startup firms funded by private equity and venture capital, may be able to move more quickly to develop research and tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and frameworks, we may not generate enough interest from potential clients to win new business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Examples include the shift from local network computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We believe our ability to develop innovative technology has historically given us a competitive advantage.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As mentioned above, though, we believe lower technology costs and growth in open software platforms have lowered barriers to entry for new competitors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our competitors may also be able to introduce new technology more rapidly than we are to meet changing market needs.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If we fail to develop and implement new technology rapidly enough, we may sacrifice new business opportunities or renewals from existing customers.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We may also incur additional operating expense if major software projects take longer than anticipated.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, if our execution speed is too slow, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Customers routinely enter personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, we handle increasing amounts of personally identifiable information in areas such as Morningstar Retirement Manager, HelloWallet, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, ByAllAccounts, Morningstar Office, Enterprise Data Management, and Morningstar.com.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In 2014, we acquired HelloWallet, which provides personalized financial guidance to individuals through their employer benefit plans.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Through HelloWallet's website and mobile applications, employees enter their goals and priorities and add their financial information, including income, bank accounts, credit cards, retirement plans, insurance, and investments.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	We also acquired ByAllAccounts, which uses technology to collect, consolidate, and transform financial account data and deliver it to any platform.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Both HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts handle a large volume of personally identifiable information as part of their normal business operations.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Any failure to safeguard this information could damage our reputation and business results.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We must continuously invest in systems, processes, and controls to guard against the risk of improper access to this information, which could be disclosed through employee errors, other inadvertent release, failure to restrict access, or failure to properly purge and protect data.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may suffer malicious attacks by individuals or groups seeking to penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These attacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated, and difficult to detect.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other information about individuals or their accounts.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Given the growing concern over data privacy and identity theft, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to increased scrutiny by clients and regulators.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, Social Security number, account numbers, portfolio holdings, credit card information, or other personal information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations could adversely affect our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our investment management operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our investment advisory activities are complex.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act and ERISA.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If we fail to comply with securities laws and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary is an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examination by the SEC.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We also publish credit ratings and research on corporate debt issuers and have completed a preliminary application to expand our NRSRO license to include ratings for corporate credits and financial institutions.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, the broad scope of our business operations makes it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory or credit rating services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	An outage of our database, technology-based products and services, or network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, much of which is geographically concentrated in our Chicago headquarters and other backup locations in the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent, which increases the risk of failure.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Problems in our network systems may lead to cascading effects involving product downtime, overloading of third-party data centers, and other issues that may affect our clients.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	To defend against these threats, we implement a series of controls focusing on both prevention and detection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, automated scanning and testing, server hardening, anti-virus software, and patch management.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We make significant investments in servers, storage, and other network infrastructure to prevent incidents of network failure and downtime, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will work as planned.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our data, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our headquarters.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative effect on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We now have approximately 850 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China, or about one-fifth of our total workforce.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Recent news reports have heightened concerns about problems related to data privacy, security, and protection of intellectual property rights in China, as well.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	While we have short-term backup plans in place, it would be difficult for us to maintain and update our mutual fund database if we were unable to access our Shenzhen operations for an extended period of time.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have approximately 500 employees who work at our data collection facility in Mumbai, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds, and part of our growth since 1984 can be attributed to favorable industry trends.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 to 40 years, but suffered along with the market downturn in 2008 and early 2009.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Over the past 15 years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend has been more dramatic in recent years.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In 2015, actively managed mutual funds suffered more than $200 billion of net outflows, compared with net inflows of more than $400 billion for passively managed funds.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Overall, we estimate that passively managed portfolios now account for nearly one-third of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Continued downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products, including our software, data, and analyst research.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may hurt our results, resulting in lower revenue from asset-based fees, transaction-based revenue, or other parts of our business.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our business results are partly driven by factors outside of our control, including general economic and financial market trends.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Any unfavorable changes in the environment we operate in could cause a corresponding negative effect on our business results.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result, we may experience lower revenue, operating income, and other financial results in the event of a market downturn.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Many of our customers are asset management firms and other financial services companies, which are also subject to external trends and changes.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	For example, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to spending cutbacks among many of the companies we sell to.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Some institutional clients have implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market in recent years, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Many companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation and pressure to reduce fees, which may increase their operating costs and cause them to reduce spending.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition, our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines as well as the level of cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In 2015, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 15% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Asset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P58_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales, which made up about 4% of consolidated revenue in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our structured credit rating business, which made up about 5% of consolidated revenue in 2015, is subject to volatility from trends in new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	If industry-wide issuance for commercial mortgage-backed securities declines, our revenue associated with this line of business may also go down.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We experience competition for analysts, technology experts, and other employees from other companies and organizations.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	These organizations often have greater resources than we do and are often able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Joe is heavily involved in our day-to-day operations, business strategy, and overall company direction.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our operations outside of the United States involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $203.7 million in revenue in 2015, or about 26% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on issuers of structured credits and corporate credits.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2015, Joe Mansueto, our chairman and chief executive officer, owned approximately 56% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In addition, because we manage our business with a long-term perspective, we generally don t make significant adjustments to our strategy or cost structure in response to short-term factors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	As a result, our operating results may suffer in the short term.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P75_S6	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P77_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership positions.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In the past, we granted stock options to employees as a significant part of their overall compensation package.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In 2006, we began granting restricted stock units to our employees and non-employee directors.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	As of December 31, 2015, our employees and non-employee directors held options to acquire 52,096 shares of common stock, all of which were exercisable at a weighted average price of approximately $57.52 per share.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P79_S3	As of December 31, 2015, there were 587,450 restricted stock units outstanding, which have an average remaining vesting period of 31 months.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Generally speaking, the company issues a share of stock when a restricted stock unit vests.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options to purchase common stock and we issue shares when restricted stock units vest, there will be further dilution.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Future grants of stock options or restricted stock units may also result in dilution.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may raise additional funds through future sales of our common stock.
1289419_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Any such financing would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we leased approximately 377,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our corporate headquarters located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease approximately 375,000 square feet of office space in 26 other countries around the world, including 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that arise in the normal course of our business.
1289419_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	Although we may not be able to predict the outcome of a particular proceeding, we do not believe that the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 19, 2016 , the last reported sale price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $78.97 per share, and there were 1,377 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table shows dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	We paid four dividends during 2015 .
1289419_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 22.0 cents per share in 2016 .
1289419_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2015 and during the three months ended December 31, 2015 :
1289419_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	_________________________________________________ * Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P9_S1	The authorization expires on December 31, 2017.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_16_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 15, 2016:
1289419_16_ITEM5_P11_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares each identified director and executive officer will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plan.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P11_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2015, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2016 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2016.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P11_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM5_P11_S3	Each director or executive officer identified in the table may amend or terminate his or her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 included a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Cash used for financing activities consists primarily of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program and dividend payments.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	These cash outflows are partially offset by proceeds from our revolving credit facility, stock option exercises, and excess tax benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for financing activities.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P4_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P4_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P4_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P4_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_16_ITEM6_P5_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	trends in the mutual fund industry, including the increasing popularity of passively managed investment vehicles.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Research, through license agreements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	In our credit research and rating business, we generate transaction-based revenue for our ratings on new issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our investment management business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	In our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We do not disclose a fee range for our Investment Advisory services and Workplace Solutions businesses because our fee structures vary by client.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, we believe disclosing a fee range could be detrimental to our competitive position.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We disclose changes in the services we provide or their associated fee structures (for example, a change from flat fees to asset-based fees) in our SEC filings to the extent that they are material to our consolidated financial results.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	We invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2015, totaled $152.0 million (of which $140.7 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $11.3 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	At the end of 2014, the amount of deferred revenue was $146.0 million , all of which was classified as a current liability.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	In recent years, our deferred revenue balance has increased at a more moderate rate, partly because we've been issuing more quarterly and monthly invoices versus up-front, annual invoices.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	In addition, as we ve migrated Principia subscribers to Morningstar Advisor Workstation and other products that meet their needs, we have less subscription-based revenue contributing to the deferred revenue balance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low, partly because our business focuses on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Cost of revenue also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases and data lines.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our capital expenditures are mainly for information technology equipment, leasehold improvements, and capitalized software development costs.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	We also include amortization related to intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the United States and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	We account for our minority-owned investment in Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) using the equity method.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not build long-term shareholder value.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Organic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	For subscription-based products, we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2016.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	After posting double-digit gains for each of the three previous years, the U.S. stock market finished 2015 barely in positive territory.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year with a 0.7% gain.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Morningstar s Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished the year down 0.6%.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	With a less favorable market as a backdrop, the fund industry was relatively flat in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total U.S. mutual fund assets were down slightly to $15.7 trillion as of December 31, 2015, compared with $15.9 trillion as of December 31, 2014, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Based on Morningstar s analysis of fund flow trends, long-term mutual funds had aggregate net inflows of about $200 billion in 2015, down from about $460 billion in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios a trend that continued accelerating in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	In 2015, actively managed mutual funds suffered more than $200 billion of net outflows, compared with net inflows of more than $400 billion for passively managed funds.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2015 with $2.1 trillion in assets under management based on ICI data, up from about $2.0 trillion as of December 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Based on data from ComScore, aggregate monthly average page views to financial and investment sites were down about 7% in 2015, while the number of unique users decreased by about 12%.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The number of pages viewed per visit was up about 5%, though, and time spent per visit increased by about 8%.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	We believe these results indicate that while fewer investors visited financial and investment sites during 2015, the remaining users were more engaged.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Results for Morningstar.com generally showed similar trends, with the exception of monthly average page views.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Monthly average page views for Morningstar.com increased by approximately 25% in 2015 based on ComScore data, driven by a large increase in pages viewed per visit.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Amid these trends, we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies was generally positive in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	A report published by eMarketer in September 2015 estimated that global online advertising spending would increase by about 18% across all industries in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	We believe advertising spending in the financial services industry also increased versus 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	In addition to industry developments in 2015, there are several longer-term trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Advisors are now required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles (including funds, ETFs, and other products) and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Financial advisors are also required to fully disclose and have clients agree on fees for advice and charge separately for any funds or investments.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors, although UK regulators are reportedly considering changes to this restriction.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	In September 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a final draft of an updated version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, also known as MiFID II.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The new regulatory framework is scheduled to go into effect in January 2017 and aims to ensure that secondary markets are fair, transparent, and safe.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	It also seeks to ensure that investors interests are safeguarded when being sold investment products.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	In Australia, the government has continued to implement the series of Future of Financial Advice reforms that began in July 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Some of these reforms include requirements relating to annual fee disclosure and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	In response, we believe financial advisors have become more focused on client engagement to demonstrate the value of the services they provide.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	In December 2015, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority published a series of new reporting standards for superannuation funds (a type of pension plan for employees to use in saving for retirement) with additional reporting requirements regarding assets held.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	We've expanded our data collection and distribution services to help asset management firms and superannuation funds meet these standards.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	In the United States, the Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed a rule that would impose a fiduciary standard for financial advisors working with defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The new standard would require them to act in the best interest of clients when making investment recommendations instead of the looser suitability standards currently in place.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	President Obama has endorsed the proposed rule for a fiduciary standard for financial advisors providing retirement advice.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	We believe the increased regulatory scrutiny of advisors could have a broad impact on the financial services sector, including a greater need for independent advice, tools, and solutions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Overall, we believe the business environment for the financial services industry remains challenging.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Asset management firms are facing increasing regulatory burdens, which are leading to higher costs and more cautious spending.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Further, the historically low interest rate environment continues to put pressure on margins for some firms, most notably those in the variable annuity space.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	As a result, we expect there will be further pressure on revenue from clients in this area.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Beginning in the second half of 2015, the global financial markets began showing significantly higher levels of volatility, and equity market returns have generally turned negative.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	For the year to date through February 25, 2016, Morningstar's U.S. Market Index was down 4.8%.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The recent market downturn has significantly increased the level of uncertainty for individual investors, financial advisors, and asset management firms.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	In addition, new issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities began declining in the second half of 2015 and has remained weak during the first two months of 2016.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	A downturn in the financial markets directly impacts several of our businesses in an adverse fashion, including revenue from asset-based fees and Morningstar Credit Ratings.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	It also may have other negative effects on our clients, including increased caution, longer sales cycles, and reduced spending.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	The tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we changed our reporting to show the number of enterprise clients for Morningstar Advisor Workstation instead of individual licenses.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	We believe this is a better way to capture underlying business trends because per-user pricing varies significantly depending on the scope of the license.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	We also began disclosing the number of licenses for Morningstar Office as a separate line item.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	(2) The asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis-point fees, including consulting arrangements and other agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	We also provide Investment Advisory services for some assets for which we receive a flat fee; we do not include these assets in the total reported above.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Because we don't have custody of the underlying assets, it's difficult for us to quantify cash inflows and outflows for these portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	(3) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	(4) Revised to include Ibbotson Australia and a minor classification change.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	(6) Key product revenue includes the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	(7) Revised to include a minor classification change.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 include a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	In 2015 , our consolidated revenue rose 3.8% .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Currency movements were a major factor in our 2015 results, as continued strength in the U.S. dollar reduced revenue from our international operations when translated into U.S. dollars.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	This has been an ongoing trend for several quarters and reduced revenue by $26.9 million in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Some of the main contributors to the 2015 revenue increase were Morningstar Direct, Workplace Solutions, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Positive results for these products were partially offset by decreases in Morningstar Enterprise Components and Principia.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Morningstar Direct was the biggest contributor to growth in both 2015 and 2014, with revenue increasing by $9.9 million in 2015 and $12.5 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to about 11,400 worldwide at the end of 2015, compared with about 10,000 at the end of 2014 and 8,500 at the end of 2013, with strong growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	Growth in Morningstar Direct reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Revenue for Workplace Solutions increased by $9.3 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Assets under management and advisement for Workplace Solutions rose 16.8% year over year, mainly reflecting growth in custom models.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Revenue for Morningstar Credit Ratings rose $5.8 million, reflecting both higher new issuance volume for the year overall and a significant increase in the asset value of new-issue ratings.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Revenue for Morningstar Data increased $5.0 million, mainly reflecting new contracts and renewals for managed products data.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	In addition, several larger contracts renewed during 2015 with additional revenue added upon renewal.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Morningstar Advisor Workstation's revenue increased an additional $4.7 million, mainly driven by clients migrating from legacy software products.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Revenue from Morningstar Principia and a few other legacy software products declined $10.0 million because we've been migrating subscribers to newer workflow solutions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The asset-based fees we earn are generally based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $176.8 billion in 2015, compared with $166.3 billion in 2014 and $161.6 billion in 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	We had $116.9 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2015 , an increase of $22.8 million compared with $94.1 million in 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	In 2013 , revenue from asset-based fees was $88.6 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 14.8% of consolidated revenue in 2015 , an increase of 2.4 percentage points compared with 12.4% in 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	In 2014 , our consolidated revenue increased 8.9% .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Some of the main contributors to the increase were Morningstar Direct, Workplace Solutions, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, and Morningstar Credit Ratings.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Positive results for these products were partially offset by a $9.1 million decline in Principia.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Revenue for Investment Advisory services was down $2.3 million, reflecting the ongoing effect of clients moving to in-house management for fund-of-funds portfolios in the variable annuity industry.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	To make it easier to compare our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	In November 2015, we acquired Total Rebalance Expert (tRx).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	In April 2014, we acquired ByAllAccounts, Inc. (ByAllAccounts) and in June 2014, we acquired an additional 81.3% interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. (HelloWallet) to become the sole owner.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2015 , we had $4.1 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, currency translations reduced revenue by about $26.9 million in 2015 , mainly because of the weaker Euro, Australian dollar, British pound, and Canadian dollar.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 6.8% in 2015 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	In 2014 , we had $11.4 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	In addition, currency translations reduced revenue by about $2.5 million in 2014, mainly because of the weaker Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the stronger British pound.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 7.6% in 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	International revenue made up about 26% of our consolidated revenue in 2015 , compared to 28% in both 2014 and 2013 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revenue from international operations decreased 2.7% in 2015 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations, revenue from international operations increased 10.2% .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our operations in the United Kingdom were the main contributors to the organic increase, followed by Continental Europe and Japan.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	In 2014 , revenue from international operations rose 6.0% , as our operations in Continental Europe enjoyed stronger product sales, and revenue growth was also relatively strong in United Kingdom and Australia.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The graph below illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data, Investment Advisory services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 99% in 2015 , compared with 95% in 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase partly reflects some larger renewals for Morningstar Data, Enterprise Components, and Morningstar Research that included additional business upon renewal.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	These positive trends were partly offset by slightly lower renewal rates for Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2015 , we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products, including Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, Morningstar Office, and newsletter products, was approximately 67% in 2015 , compared with 69% in 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The decline was mainly driven by a lower retention rate for Morningstar.com Premium Memberships, partly offset by positive retention trends for Morningstar Office and our international operations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Note: Following our change to a more centralized structure during 2013, we refined the classification of employees within operating expense categories.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	As a result, approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue starting in the second half of 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	These changes added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue in 2014 versus 2013, and reduced the compensation expense included in the sales and marketing and general and administrative categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million, respectively, in the same period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	These changes did not affect total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	In 2015 , our operating expense was down $56.3 million , or 8.6% .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	We settled a dispute with Business Logic for $61.0 million in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	In addition, as a result of the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, foreign currency translations had a favorable effect of $23.9 million on operating expense during 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Commission expense decreased $14.7 million in 2015 , mainly because we changed to a new sales commission structure that requires a different accounting treatment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	In the first quarter of 2014, we started expensing sales commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the term of the underlying contracts.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	However, we continued to amortize the prepaid commission balance from the previous commission plan.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	This amortization triggered an additional $3.5 million and $9.8 million of sales commission cost in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Legal and other professional fees were down $4.2 million in 2015, mainly reflecting litigation-related legal fees in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Also reducing operating expense was an increase in capitalized software development.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	In 2015, we capitalized $21.8 million of software development expense for ongoing enhancements of key platforms and new development of upgraded software platforms.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	In comparison, we capitalized a total of $18.8 million of software development expense in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Compensation expense (including salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $6.3 million in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	While headcount remained relatively flat during the first nine months of the year, net headcount increased by about 100 employees during the fourth quarter as we continued to invest in our key growth initiatives.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	The new hires mainly reflect technology, client support, and credit analyst roles in the United States and India.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	Overall, we had 3,930 employees worldwide at the end of 2015, compared with 3,760 at the end of 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Depreciation expense was up $9.8 million in 2015, mainly reflecting additional capitalized software development and computer software purchases for our U.S. operations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Advertising and marketing, computer and software supplies, rent, and production expense were also higher during 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	In 2014, our operating expense was up $126.9 million, or 24.0%.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The $61.0 million litigation settlement expense incurred in 2014 contributed approximately half of this increase.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	Higher compensation expense (including salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) also contributed to the change.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We had approximately 3,760 employees worldwide at the end of 2014, compared with 3,565 at the end of 2013 an increase of approximately 200 employees.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	The ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet acquisitions added approximately 100 employees on a combined basis.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	We also added product and technology roles in the United States as well as equity data analysts in India.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Depreciation expense was up $8.4 million in 2014, mainly reflecting additional capitalized software development and computer software purchases for our U.S. operations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Production expense was up $6.7 million in 2014, mainly reflecting higher costs for information technology maintenance agreements and infrastructure, as well as an unrealized loss on some of our model portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	This expense growth was partially offset by an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	In 2014, we capitalized $18.8 million of software development costs for ongoing enhancements as well as new development of upgraded software platforms, compared with $8.1 million in 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Total operating expense also includes bonus expense and stock-based compensation expense, which we include in each of the cost categories shown in the table above.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	Bonus expense was $50.7 million in 2015, compared with $48.1 million in 2014 and $40.9 million in 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	Stock-based compensation expense was $17.4 million in 2015, compared with $17.6 million in 2014 and $15.0 million in 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	In 2015, cost of revenue was up $11.5 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Higher salary expense of $7.9 million was the main reason for the increase, reflecting new hires we made to support the growth of our business as well as annual merit increases.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	Higher expense for bonus, professional fees, and production expense also contributed to the change in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was a higher level of capitalized software development, which reduced cost of revenue during 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	We capitalized $21.8 million associated with software development activities in 2015 versus $18.8 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cost of revenue rose $47.2 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	The $14.0 million of additional expense from the shift in employee cost categories discussed above was a major factor behind the growth in cost of revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	In 2014, other increases in salary expense, bonus, and other compensation costs which totaled about $44.4 million also contributed to growth in this category.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	Production expense was up $6.7 million in 2014, mainly reflecting higher costs for information technology maintenance agreements and infrastructure, as well as an unrealized loss on some of our model portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	These increases were partially offset by a higher level of capitalized software development in 2014, which reduced cost of revenue during 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	We capitalized $18.8 million of software development in 2014, compared with $8.1 million in 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased by about 0.1 percentage points in 2015 and increased 3.0 percentage points in 2014, with approximately 2 percentage points of the change in 2014 driven by the shift in employee cost categories.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Sales and marketing expense decreased $14.5 million in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Lower sales commission expense of $13.9 million (mainly reflecting the change in sales commission structure discussed above) as well as lower salary expense of $2.1 million were the primary contributors to the decrease.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	Partly offsetting these decreases was an increase in advertising and marketing expense of $3.0 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	In 2014, the shift in employee cost categories reduced sales and marketing expense by approximately $8.0 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Despite this reduction, total sales and marketing expense was still up $7.5 million in 2014, mainly because of higher sales commission costs following the change in commission plan discussed above.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Additional costs for advertising and marketing also contributed to this increase, but to a lesser extent.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	This expense growth was partly offset by lower costs for travel, training, and conferences.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was down 2.4 percentage points in 2015 and 0.2 percentage points in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	General and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Legal fees decreased $3.5 million as a result of litigation-related legal fees in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	Salary expense also decreased $0.9 million in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in rent and utilities expense, mainly because of new and expanded office space in New York and London.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	In 2014, the shift in employee cost categories discussed above reduced general and administrative (G A) expense by approximately $6.0 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Despite this reduction, total G A expense still increased by $2.0 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	Rent and facilities costs were up $2.8 million versus 2013, mainly because we expanded our office space in the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	This additional expense was partially offset by a $1.5 million credit we recorded for damages received in connection with a legal matter in the first quarter of 2014, which partially offset growth in legal and other professional fees.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	G A expense as a percentage of revenue was down 0.7 percentage points in 2015 and 1.0 percentage points in 2014, mainly because of the shift in employee cost categories.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Depreciation expense rose $9.8 million in 2015 and $8.4 million in 2014, mainly because of higher capital expenditures for computer software and incremental capitalized software development costs for our operations in the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	Intangible amortization expense decreased $0.3 million in 2015 as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	Intangible amortization expense increased $0.8 million in 2014, as additional amortization expense for the intangible assets of HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts was largely offset by the completed amortization of intangible assets from some previous acquisitions .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining lives of the assets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	We estimate that this expense will total approximately $17.7 million in 2016 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, dispositions, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Overall, depreciation and amortization increased $9.5 million in 2015 and $9.2 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	We recorded a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense in the second quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	This expense is included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and contributed nearly half of the increase in operating expense in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $85.0 million in 2015 as our revenue increased $28.7 million and operating expense decreased by $56.3 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	Operating margin was 24.2% , an increase of 10.3 percentage points compared with 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	The decrease in operating expense in 2015 mainly reflects the $61.0 million litigation settlement expense incurred in the second quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	In 2014, the $61.0 million settlement was the biggest contributor to the decline in operating income and operating margin compared with 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	We also had higher salary and other compensation-related expense from additional headcount, reflecting both new hires and employees added with the ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet acquisitions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	We reported adjusted operating income, which excludes the settlement, of $166.6 million in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure; the table above shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	We present adjusted operating income (operating income excluding the settlement) to show the effect of this charge, better reflect period-over-period comparisons, and improve overall understanding of our current and future financial performance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	We reported an adjusted operating margin, which excludes the settlement, of 21.9% in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure; the table above shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	We present adjusted operating margin (operating margin excluding the settlement) for the same reasons mentioned above.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table presents the components of non-operating income, net:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance on the credit facility we established in 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Non-operating income in 2014 includes the $5.2 million gain we recorded with our purchase of the remaining ownership interest in HelloWallet, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	Non-operating income in 2013 includes the $3.6 million gain we recorded with our purchase of the remaining ownership interest in Morningstar Sweden, which was also previously a minority investment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Other income (expense), net primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of our business operations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities primarily reflects Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	The $1.4 million decrease in 2014 reflects an impairment charge for our ownership interest in a smaller unconsolidated entity.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2015 was 32.1% , an increase of 0.8 percentage points compared with 31.3% in 2014, primarily reflecting higher state taxes.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2014 was 31.3% , almost exactly at par with 2013 , when we provided for income taxes at an effective tax rate of 31.2% .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P131_S1	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P131_S2	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P131_S3	We invest a portion of our investments balance (approximately $26.1 million, or 63% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2015 ) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P131_S4	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Approximately 26% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2015 was held by our operations in the United States, down from about 28% as of December 31, 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	We do not expect to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	We have not recognized deferred tax liabilities for the portion of the outside basis differences (including unremitted earnings) relating to foreign subsidiaries because the investment in these subsidiaries is considered to be permanent in duration.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	It is not practical to quantify the deferred tax liability associated with these outside basis differences.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $248.6 million , an increase of $24.0 million compared with $224.6 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	The increase reflects net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and the net effect of changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	These items were partially offset by $97.0 million used to repurchase common stock through our share repurchase program, $57.3 million of capital expenditures, bonus payments of $47.8 million, and dividend payments of $33.7 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	In 2015 , cash provided by operating activities was $238.9 million , driven by $212.5 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $26.4 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	In December 2015, our board of directors approved a $300.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $1.0 billion .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	In 2015 , we repurchased a total of approximately 1.2 million shares for $97.0 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had repurchased a total of 9.4 million shares for $623.5 million since we announced the share repurchase program in September 2010.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	In 2015 , we also paid dividends of $33.7 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	In February 2016 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	The dividend is payable on April 29, 2016 to shareholders of record as of April 8, 2016 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P137_S3	We expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 22 cents per share in 2016 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	We expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2016 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	We also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2016 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $50.0 million related to the 2015 bonus.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	In July 2015, we renewed our $75.0 million single-bank revolving credit facility in the United States, which we intend to use for general corporate purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	We had an outstanding principal balance of $35.0 million as of December 31, 2015 at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points, leaving borrowing availability of $40.0 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P141_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	We generated free cash flow of $181.6 million in 2015 , an increase of $107.7 million versus 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	The change reflects a $106.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $1.0 million decrease in capital expenditures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P143_S2	Free cash flow for 2014 included a $61.0 million cash outflow in connection with the litigation settlement.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	In 2014 , free cash flow was down $79.2 million from 2013 , largely because of the $61.0 million litigation settlement payment, as well as growth in capital expenditures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	We invested a total of $86.6 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P148_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P148_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P148_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P148_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P150_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P150_S2	We also provide research, investment advisory, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P150_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P155_S1	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2015 , totaled $152.0 million (of which $140.7 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $11.3 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P155_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P156_S1	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P156_S2	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P157_S1	We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P157_S2	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P157_S3	On occasion we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation experts for significant assets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P159_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and non-compete agreements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P160_S1	These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S4	We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S5	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S6	We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P161_S7	If we determine that goodwill is impaired, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash-flow methodology.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for businesses and determination of weighted average cost of capital.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P162_S2	We believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations in connection with acquisitions and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	We measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S2	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S3	We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S4	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P164_S5	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	We believe the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	Tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P168_S2	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P168_S3	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P168_S4	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P169_S1	The excess tax benefits associated with stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our Consolidated Income Statement.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $40.8 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $59.4 million .
1289419_16_ITEM7_P170_S1	The deferred tax assets include $3.7 million of deferred tax assets related to $18.4 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $12.1 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P172_S1	If we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P172_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P172_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P173_S1	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P173_S2	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P173_S3	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P173_S4	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P174_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P175_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P175_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P176_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P177_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P177_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P177_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company to adopt beginning on January 1, 2017.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S4	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P178_S5	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	On September 28, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments , which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for adjustments made during the measurement period.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P180_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2016.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P180_S3	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-16 in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position and apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	The standard permits the use of either the prospective or retrospective method.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-17 retrospectively in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	(2) The 2016 minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $35.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P187_S1	Only the interest and commitment fees are mandatory payments during 2016, as we anticipate renewing the one-year revolving credit facility in July 2016 and any outstanding principal balance at that time.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits).
1289419_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2016.
1289419_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	The table excludes $6.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	These accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $248.6 million.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The table below shows our exposure to foreign currency denominated revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 :

1289419_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) , and our report dated February 26, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Morningstar Inc. s internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited Morningstar, Inc. s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	Morningstar, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P8_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P8_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and the financial statement schedule, and our report dated February 26, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and accompanying schedule.

1289419_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	We have operations in 27 countries.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	We conduct our business operations through wholly owned or majority-owned operating subsidiaries.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	We consolidate assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P23_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	In accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, we present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income (OCI) in two separate but consecutive statements, our Consolidated Statements of Income and separately, our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	In addition, effective January 1, 2013, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	We show the effects of items reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement along with net income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Certain amounts reported in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Separately, as a result of our move to a more centralized structure in 2013 (including new positions created, changes in focus for some existing roles, and the refinement of employee cost categorizations as we moved to a more centralized structure), approximately 180 net positions shifted from the general and administrative and sales and marketing categories to cost of revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	These changes added approximately $14 million of compensation expense to cost of revenue in 2014 versus 2013, and reduced the compensation expense included in the sales and marketing and general and administrative categories by approximately $8 million and $6 million , respectively, in the same period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	These changes did not affect total operating expense or operating income for any of the periods presented.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	We state the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds at fair value, as these funds are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities, primarily to satisfy the requirements of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, which is a registered broker-dealer.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of equity securities, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 6 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	We include capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	The table below summarizes our capitalized software development costs for the past three years:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Over the past several years, we have acquired companies that complement our business operations.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S3	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their full fair values as of the date we obtain control, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S4	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P46_S5	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , on the acquisition date.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	We did not record any impairment losses in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P50_S3	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P50_S4	We did not record any impairment losses in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Delivery of our products and services has taken place.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, Premium Membership subscriptions for Morningstar.com, our structured credit research and ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	For new-issue ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS), we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Our Investment Advisory business includes a broad range of services.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	Pricing for consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service provided, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Our Workplace Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that offer proprietary mutual funds) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	For our Workplace Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The revenue arrangements for Workplace Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements combine multiple products and services.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of licenses or subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Through December 31, 2013, we paid sales commissions based on a formula driven by the total contract value of sales opportunities closed, with any subsequent adjustments (such as clawbacks for contract cancellations) reflected in future commission payouts.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	We considered the corresponding commission expense an incremental direct acquisition cost and treated it as a deferred charge, which we expensed over the term of the underlying sales contracts.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	In the first quarter of 2014, we modified our sales incentive plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The revised plan is based on a combination of net new sales and specific business objectives not solely tied to revenue growth.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	Because of this new structure and the discretion involved in determining the related incentives, we started expensing sales commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the contract terms.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P68_S3	However, we continued to amortize the deferred charge capitalized in connection with sales commissions paid in 2013 and previous periods as part of the previous incentive plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P68_S4	This amortization added $3.5 million and $9.8 million of sales commission cost in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and stock options.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	For stock options, we estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	In certain of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, Morningstar's full-time employees are generally eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave and include this liability in Accrued Compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	We compute and present income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The difference between weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding mainly reflects the dilutive effect associated with our stock-based compensation plans.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	We further compute income per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-45-59A, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Under the two-class method, we allocate earnings between common stock and participating securities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	For purposes of calculating earnings per share, we reduce our reported net earnings by the amount allocated to participating securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASC 260-10-45-59A requires the dilutive effect of participating securities to be calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	We have determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	As such, we adjusted the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per share calculation for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities to calculate diluted earnings per share.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	We translate the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for revenue and expense.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	We use the local currency as the functional currency for all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	We record translation adjustments for non-U.S. subsidiaries as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P81_S3	We include exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	In July 2015, we renewed our $75.0 million , single-bank revolving credit facility.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	We drew on the credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2015 and had an outstanding principal balance of $35.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points as of December 31, 2015 , leaving borrowing availability of $40.0 million .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Basic net income per share attributable to Morningstar, Inc.:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Net income attributable to Morningstar, Inc.:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Basic net income per share attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Diluted net income per share attributable to Morningstar, Inc.:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Diluted net income per share attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table shows the number of weighted average restricted stock units and performance share awards excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	Stock options could be included in the calculation in the future.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	We report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 2 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	We evaluate the performance of our reporting segment based on revenue and operating income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	The tables below summarize our revenue and long-lived assets by geographical area:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	Our investment portfolio consists of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P96_S4	We classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	The expected maturities of certain fixed-income securities may differ from their contractual maturities because some of these holdings have call features that allow the issuers the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , held-to-maturity investments included a $1.5 million certificate of deposit, held as collateral against bank guarantees for our office leases, primarily in Australia.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The table below shows the fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the fair value hierarchy and the necessary disclosures under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement :
1289419_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P106_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting each of these investment categories in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, mutual funds, equity securities, and exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	In July 2015, we acquired an additional 28.9% interest in Ibbotson Associates Japan K.K. (IAJ), increasing our ownership to 100% from 71.1% .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	As we previously owned more than 50% of the company, IAJ's financial results were consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements prior to acquiring the remaining interest.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	In November 2015, we acquired Total Rebalance Expert (tRx), an automated, tax-efficient investment portfolio rebalancing platform for financial advisors.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	tRx streamlines the rebalancing process for advisors and automates the complexities involved in rebalancing and managing portfolios.

1289419_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Increased Ownership Interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	In June 2014, we acquired an additional 81.3% interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. (HelloWallet), increasing our ownership to 100% from 18.7% .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	HelloWallet combines behavioral economics and the psychology of decision-making with sophisticated technology to provide personalized, unbiased financial guidance to U.S. workers and their families through their employer benefit plans.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on June 3, 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	HelloWallet's total estimated fair value of $54.0 million includes $40.5 million in cash paid to acquire the remaining 81.3% interest in HelloWallet and pay off HelloWallet's indebtedness as well as $13.5 million related to the 18.7% of HelloWallet we previously held.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	We recorded a non-cash holding gain of $5.2 million for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held investment.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	The gain is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	The allocation includes $9.5 million of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $3.6 million mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	We recognized a deferred tax asset of $8.6 million mainly because of net operating losses of HelloWallet which will become available to Morningstar.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	Goodwill of $39.2 million represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to bring together HelloWallet's comprehensive financial wellness expertise with Morningstar's independent, research-based retirement advice to create a holistic retirement savings and advice offering.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	In April 2014, we acquired ByAllAccounts, Inc. (ByAllAccounts), a provider of innovative data aggregation technology for financial applications for $27.9 million in cash.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	ByAllAccounts uses a knowledge-based process, including patented artificial intelligence technology, to collect, consolidate, and enrich financial account data and deliver it to virtually any platform.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P119_S2	We began including the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on April 1, 2014.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition:

1289419_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $3.3 million mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	We recognized a deferred tax asset of $4.0 million mainly because of net operating losses of ByAllAccounts which will become available to Morningstar.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Goodwill of $18.5 million represents the premium we paid over the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to integrate the service into our offerings as well as expand and develop ByAllAccounts' third-party distribution relationships.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	In May 2013, we acquired an additional 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden AB (Morningstar Sweden), increasing our ownership to 100% from 24% .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	Morningstar s main offerings in Sweden include Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, Morningstar Enterprise Components (formerly Integrated Web Tools), and Morningstar.se, a website for individual investors.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P126_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 2, 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	Morningstar Sweden's total estimated fair value of $18.5 million included $14.5 million in cash paid to acquire the remaining 76% interest in Morningstar Sweden and $4.0 million related to the 24% of Morningstar Sweden we previously held.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	We determined the fair value of the previously held 24% investment independent of the acquired controlling interest by applying a minority interest discount based on analysis of comparable transactions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash holding gain of $3.6 million , which is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The allocation included acquired intangible assets, as follows:

1289419_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	Goodwill of $8.9 million represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer Morningstar's full suite of products and services to investors in Sweden and further leverage Morningstar's global reach, investment databases, and technology expertise.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015 :
1289419_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	We did not record any impairment losses in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 , as the estimated fair values of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year.

1289419_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their expected economic useful lives.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Based on acquisitions and divestitures completed through December 31, 2015 , we expect intangible amortization expense for 2016 and subsequent years to be as follows:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful life, and currency translations.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated entities consist primarily of the following:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	Morningstar Japan K.K. Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) develops and markets products and services customized for the Japanese market.

1289419_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	Deferred rent includes build-out and rent abatement allowances received, which are amortized over the remaining portion of the original term of the lease as a reduction in office lease expense.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	We include deferred rent, as appropriate, in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Deferred rent, noncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	Our shareholders approved the Morningstar 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) on May 17, 2011.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	As of that date, we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).
1289419_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	The 2004 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Morningstar 2000 Stock Option Plan, and the Morningstar 2001 Stock Option Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P154_S1	The 2011 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including, among other things, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and stock options.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	We granted restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options under the 2004 Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P155_S1	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P155_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P155_S3	Any shares subject to awards under the 2011 Plan, but not under the 2004 Plan, that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following table summarizes the number of shares available for future grants under our 2011 Plan:

1289419_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2015 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	Our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense annually in the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four -year period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P162_S3	For restricted stock units granted through December 31, 2008, employees could elect to defer receipt of the Morningstar common stock issued upon vesting of the restricted stock unit.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	In 2014, we introduced a long-term incentive award program consisting of performance shares.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P165_S1	In March 2015, executive officers, other than Joe Mansueto, and certain other employees, were granted performance share awards.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P165_S2	These awards entitle the holder to a number of shares of Morningstar common stock equal to the number of notional performance shares that become vested.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P165_S3	Each award specifies a number of performance shares that will vest if pre-established target performance goals are attained.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P165_S4	The number of performance shares that actually vest may be more or less than the specified number of performance shares to the extent Morningstar exceeds or fails to achieve, respectively, the target performance goals over a three -year performance period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	We base the grant date fair value for these awards on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to the grant date.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the satisfaction of the performance condition that is most likely to be satisfied over the three -year performance period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	The table below shows target performance share awards granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for performance share awards granted as of December 31, 2015 :
1289419_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four -year period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P168_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P168_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P169_S2	All options granted in 2011 have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P169_S3	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P169_S4	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2015 :
1289419_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2015 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P173_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $81.18 on December 30, 2015.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, requires that we classify the cash flows that result from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	Excess tax benefits correspond to the portion of the tax deduction taken on our income tax return that exceeds the amount of tax benefit related to the compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P174_S2	The following table summarizes our excess tax benefits for the past three years:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 :
1289419_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P181_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	As a result of our retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , our December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $9.0 million reclassification of current deferred tax assets to non-current liabilities.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	The decrease in U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards in our U.S. operations.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	The decrease in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $142.7 million as of December 31, 2015 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P189_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $12.1 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P190_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P190_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P191_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2016 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $4.2 million and a non-current liability of $6.0 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P193_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $5.1 million and a non-current liability of $6.6 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P193_S2	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	In 2015 , we recorded a net increase of $6.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $2.1 million increased our income tax expense by $2.1 million .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P195_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $3.5 million for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $3.4 million decreased our income tax expense by $3.2 million .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $14.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $10.5 million , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $9.4 million .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	We recorded the decrease in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2015 .
1289419_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Over the past several years, we ve developed new research tools that provide a more holistic approach to investing and asset allocation.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Whereas traditional asset allocation methodologies focus solely on financial assets (such as stocks and bonds), we ve developed methodologies that provide a more complete view of all sources of wealth, including financial capital, human capital, housing assets, and retirement and pension benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Develop Morningstar Direct as our flagship decision support platform.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	In 2015, we began rolling out the next-generation version of Morningstar Direct, our institutional investment research platform.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The new software is designed to be more intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	It provides a more consistent, cohesive experience with a strong emphasis on Morningstar s proprietary research and tools.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We also improved the underlying technology, including a more streamlined development process for commonly used Morningstar capabilities such as portfolio management tools.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The new software is fully web-based, which eliminates the need for desktop software installations and allows immediate access to new features.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	It allows to us innovate more rapidly and more easily configure our software solutions to meet client needs.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	It also addresses the growing need for mobile-optimized capabilities to extend the desktop experience onto mobile devices.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Over the past several years, we've started migrating many of our core software capabilities to Morningstar Direct, which will serve as our main platform for clients looking for information to support the investment decisions they make on their own or validate investment recommendations from another party.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We're also continuing to expand the user base for Morningstar Direct by enhancing capabilities for our existing asset management clients and adding workflows for new types of clients, such as financial advisors.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	3. Build world-class investment management solutions based on our proprietary research.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We leverage our innovative, proprietary research by building world-class investment management solutions that help investors achieve better outcomes.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our goal is to connect our existing capabilities to create holistic solutions that help financial advisors, asset managers, and individual investors with portfolio construction, monitoring, security selection, and implementation.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	This customer group includes independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker-dealers, dually registered advisors, and captive advisors who are employees of a broker-dealer.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	Captive broker-dealers include wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, and banks.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	In total, Cerulli Associates estimates there were approximately 310,000 financial advisors in the United States as of the end of 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe our deep understanding of individual investors needs allows us to work with advisors to help them make more efficient use of their time and deliver better investment outcomes for their clients.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our advisor solutions also draw on Morningstar s proprietary investment research methodologies and research insights.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We're expanding the range of services we offer to help financial advisors with all aspects of their daily workflow needs, including investment decision-making, portfolio construction, client monitoring and reporting, practice management, portfolio rebalancing that connects with custodial and trading interfaces, and financial planning.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, and distribution, as well as investment management (often referred to as the buy side ), which includes portfolio management and research.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	In the workplace (also known as retirement) market, millions of investors are now charged with planning for their own retirement, mainly through self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k) plans in the United States.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Assets in 401(k) plans totaled an estimated $4.6 trillion as of December 31, 2016, based on data from Cerulli Associates.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, we believe individual investors, financial advisors, employers, and government organizations have all become more aware of the need for advice and guidance that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that provide administrative and record-keeping services) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).

1289419_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	We design most of our products for individual investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing or want to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial advisors.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	We treat our brand, product names and logos, software, technology, databases, and other products as proprietary.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	We seek to protect this intellectual property by using trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; licensing and nondisclosure arrangements; and other security measures.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P124_S2	For example, we generally provide our intellectual property to third parties through standard licensing agreements, which define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we generally seek to register one or both of them in all of the relevant international classes under the trademark laws that apply to jurisdictions where we operate.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	We have registered the Morningstar name and/or logo in numerous countries and the European Union and have applied for registrations in various other countries.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	We license our products and/or other intellectual property to our customers, generally for a fee.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P128_S1	As a rule, we use our standard agreements, whether in paper or electronic form, and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with most of our larger operating companies.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	We put these agreements in place so these companies can use our intellectual property, such as our products and trademarks, to market our products and develop and sell country-specific variants of products under the Morningstar name in their operating territories.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party sources, developing it internally, and recording it based on information found in public filings.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P131_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P131_S2	We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P131_S3	This tends to offset most of the seasonality in our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P132_S1	The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	In 2016, our largest customer accounted for less than 2% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	The economic and financial information industry includes a few large firms as well as numerous smaller companies, including startup firms.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, technology, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P136_S1	We strive to adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.

1289419_17_ITEM1_P180_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P181_S0	We maintain a website at http://www.morningstar.com/company.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P181_S1	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P181_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P181_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_17_ITEM1_P181_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our investment management operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Three of our subsidiaries, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, Morningstar Investment Services LLC, and Morningstar Research Services LLC, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	These requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As registered investment advisors, these subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, in cases where these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	As of December 31, 2016, we had $46.9 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Problems could arise if these programs assigned retirement plan participants to the wrong portfolios, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Clients may take legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty, or based on our investment management fees and expenses.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on approximately $200 billion in assets as of December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We believe independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We rely on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as any negative publicity or media reports about Morningstar, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation and damage our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered by our institutional clients.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In some cases, we make investment recommendations (such as Select Lists) within the framework of client constraints.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	While we don t charge asset management firms for their products to be rated, we do charge licensing fees for the use of our ratings.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also receive payments from issuers for our new-issue ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities and corporate bond issues.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These payments may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to produce competitive performance in our investment management offerings.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 32 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	More recently, we ve developed unique concepts and tools such as the Wealth Forecasting Engine, Gamma, and Total Wealth Approach.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We believe these innovations set us apart because most of our competitors focus on providing data or software rather than creating their own proprietary research frameworks.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also believe our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools is at the core of what drives Morningstar s value for all of our customer groups.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we fail to continuously innovate and develop new tools to meet the needs of our customers, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we re perceived as not moving quickly enough to meet the changing needs of investors.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain attention from our clients.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe lower technology costs and the growth of open software platforms have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Smaller companies, including startup firms funded by private equity and venture capital, may be able to move more quickly to develop research and tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and frameworks, we may not generate enough interest from potential clients to win new business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Examples include the shift from local network computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our software development process is based on frequently rolling out new features so that we can quickly incorporate user feedback.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we fail to develop and implement new technology rapidly enough, we may sacrifice new business opportunities or renewals from existing customers.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may also incur additional operating expense if major software projects take longer than anticipated.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, if our execution speed is too slow, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, or if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds, and part of our growth since 1984 can be attributed to favorable industry trends.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 to 40 years, but suffered during the market downturn of 2008 and 2009.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Over the past 15 years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend has accelerated in recent years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In 2016, actively managed mutual funds suffered about $340 billion in net outflows, compared with net inflows of more than $500 billion for passively managed funds.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Overall, we estimate that passively managed portfolios now account for more than one-third of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Prolonged downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products, including our software, data, and analyst research.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Customers routinely enter personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we handle increasing amounts of personally identifiable information in areas such as Morningstar Retirement Manager, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, ByAllAccounts, Morningstar Office, Enterprise Data Management, Morningstar.com, and HelloWallet.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Through HelloWallet's website and mobile applications, employees enter their goals and priorities and add their financial information, including income, bank accounts, credit cards, retirement plans, insurance, and investments.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	ByAllAccounts uses technology to collect, consolidate, and transform financial account data and deliver it to any platform.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Accordingly, both HelloWallet and ByAllAccounts handle a large volume of personally identifiable information as part of their normal business operations.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Any failure to safeguard this information could damage our reputation and business results.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We must continuously invest in systems, processes, and controls to guard against the risk of improper access to this information, which could be disclosed through employee errors, other inadvertent release, failure to restrict access, or failure to properly purge and protect data.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may suffer malicious attacks by individuals or groups seeking to penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These attacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated, and difficult to detect.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other information about individuals or their accounts.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Given the growing concern over data privacy and identity theft, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to increased scrutiny by clients and regulators.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, Social Security number, account numbers, portfolio holdings, credit card information, or other personal information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations could adversely affect our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our investment management operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our investment advisory activities are complex.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act and ERISA.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	If we fail to comply with securities laws and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary is an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance, corporate credit issuers, and financial institutions.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Credit rating and research providers have been under increasing regulatory scrutiny in recent years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examination by the SEC, as well as periodic investigations by the SEC and other governmental authorities relating to matters of regulatory interest such as industry practices and personnel matters.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, the broad scope of our business operations makes it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory or credit rating services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	An outage of our database, technology-based products and services, or network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, which is located across multiple facilities in the United States.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are increasingly complex and interdependent, which increases the risk of failure.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Problems in our network systems may lead to cascading effects involving product downtime, overloading of third-party data centers, and other issues that may affect our clients.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	To defend against these threats, we implement a series of controls focusing on both prevention and detection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, automated scanning and testing, server hardening, anti-virus software, and patch management.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We make significant investments in servers, storage, and other network infrastructure to prevent incidents of network failure and downtime, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will work as planned.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Most of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our data, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our headquarters.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The concentration of data and development work carried out at our offshore facilities may have a negative effect on our business operations, products, and services.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We now have approximately 900 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control and the relationship between the United States and China is experiencing a period of increased political, military, and commercial tensions, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Several news reports have heightened concerns about problems related to data privacy, security, and protection of intellectual property rights in China, as well.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The concentration of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	While we have short-term backup plans in place, it would be difficult for us to maintain and update our mutual fund database if we were unable to access our Shenzhen operations for an extended period of time.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We have approximately 600 employees who work at our data collection facility in Mumbai, India, which may also be subject to regulatory and political risk (including potential terrorist acts).
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Like the Shenzhen operation, these facilities also involve operational risks for our network infrastructure.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	PitchBook, which we acquired in December 2016, has approximately 180 contract employees based in Calcutta and Pune, India who support its data and research operations and approximately 75 contract employees based in Ukraine who work on software development.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Ukraine has been subject to significant political unrest and military incursions.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Any disruption to PitchBook's contract operations in these locations would make it difficult for PitchBook to meet its operating goals.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our acquisitions and other investments may not produce the results we anticipate.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We have also incurred debt in connection with acquisitions, which may limit our financial flexibility.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We've completed numerous acquisitions over the past 10 years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In 2016, we paid approximately $188 million (subject to working capital adjustments) for the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook in a transaction that valued the company at $225.0 million.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	This acquisition presents several potential challenges and risks.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not achieve the growth targets that we established for PitchBook at the time of the acquisition.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The process of integration may require more resources than we anticipated.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We may assume unintended liabilities or experience operating difficulties or costs that we did not anticipate.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	We may also fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business, including PitchBook founder and chief executive officer John Gabbert, which would make it difficult to follow through on our operating goals for the acquisition.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S5	If our acquisition of PitchBook does not generate the results we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P57_S6	We may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from this acquisition to earn a positive return on the associated purchase price.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	To fund this acquisition, we increased the principal amount available for borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility to $300 million and extended the term of this facility to three years.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Under the terms of our agreement with the lender, we are now subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants, which may limit our financial flexibility.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve a number of risks.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	They can be time-consuming and may divert management s attention from day-to-day operations, particularly if numerous acquisitions are in process at the same time.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities, reduce our financial flexibility because of reductions in our cash balance, or result in a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may hurt our results, resulting in lower revenue from asset-based fees, transaction-based revenue, or other parts of our business.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our business results are partly driven by factors outside of our control, including general economic and financial market trends.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Any unfavorable changes in the environment we operate in could cause a corresponding negative effect on our business results.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	As a result, we may experience lower revenue, operating income, and other financial results in the event of a market downturn.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Many of our customers are asset management firms and other financial services companies, which are also subject to external trends and changes.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	For example, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to spending cutbacks among many of the companies we sell to.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Some institutional clients have implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	For example, several large insurers withdrew from the variable annuity market in recent years, while others curtailed their new sales efforts.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P63_S5	This has had a negative effect on the services we provide to institutional clients that offer variable annuities.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Many companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation and pressure to reduce fees.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In turn, many of these firms have sought to reduce their operating costs by working with fewer service providers and/or negotiating lower fees for services they purchase.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In addition, our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines, cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage, and the industry-wide trend toward lower asset-based fees.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In 2016, revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 17% of our consolidated revenue and a greater percentage of our operating income.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The amount of revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The value of assets under advisement may show substantial declines during periods of significant market volatility.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Asset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P66_S4	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales, which made up about 3% of consolidated revenue in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Many advertisers have been shifting to programmatic buying platforms that target users on other sites, which as had a negative effect on advertising revenue for our website for individual investors, Morningstar.com.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our structured credit rating business, which made up about 3% of consolidated revenue in 2016, is subject to volatility from trends in new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If industry-wide issuance for commercial mortgage-backed securities declines, our revenue associated with this line of business may also go down.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We recently expanded our coverage to include corporate credit issuers, financial institutions, and other types of asset-backed securities, which are also subject to volatility in issuance patterns.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our PitchBook Data business may also be subject to cyclical trends.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Many of PitchBook's clients are investment banks, which are subject to periodic business downturns driven by changes in the global capital markets.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	During these downturns, they often seek to reduce spending on third-party services as well as the number of employees, which would directly affect the number of prospective clients for PitchBook.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	As a data and research provider focusing on the private capital markets (including venture capital, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions), PitchBook may also be subject to volatility based on the amount of activity and market interest in these areas.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We experience competition for analysts, technology experts, and other employees from other companies and organizations.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These organizations often have greater resources than we do and are often able to offer significantly more attractive compensation packages to potential employees.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman and controlling shareholder.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Joe has recently changed his role to focus less on our day-to-day business operations, but remains heavily involved our strategy and overall company direction.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The loss of Joe or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P73_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our operations outside of the United States involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $208.1 million in revenue in 2016, or about 26% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on issuers of structured credits and corporate credits.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We also incorporate data from a variety of third-party sources for PitchBook Data.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We could be subject to claims by providers of publicly available data and information we compile from websites and other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of the source s copyrights or terms of use.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We could also be subject to claims from third parties from which we license data and information that we have used or re-distributed the data or information in ways not permitted by our license rights.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our continued ability to market one or more of our products under their current names could be adversely affected in those jurisdictions where another person registers or has a pre-existing registration on one or more of them.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2016, Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman, owned approximately 57% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In addition, because we manage our business with a long-term perspective, we generally don t make significant adjustments to our strategy or cost structure in response to short-term factors.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S3	As a result, our operating results may suffer in the short term.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S4	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may be volatile.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P87_S6	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_17_ITEM1A_P89_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we leased approximately 400,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our corporate headquarters located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease another 400,000 square feet of office space in 26 other countries around the world, including approximately 140,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 17, 2017 , the last reported sale price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $79.93 per share, and there were 1,302 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table shows dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	We paid four dividends during 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 23 cents per share in 2017 .
1289419_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P8_S1	The authorization expires on December 31, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made through September 30, 2016 and during the three months ended December 31, 2016 :
1289419_17_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_17_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 15, 2017:
1289419_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plan for Steven Kaplan completed in accordance with its terms.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares Gail Landis will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plan.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2016, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2017 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM5_P12_S3	Gail may amend or terminate her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 included a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Non-operating income in 2016 included a $37.1 million holding gain related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P3_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P3_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P3_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P4_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P4_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program and dividend payments.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P5_S1	These cash outflows are partially offset by proceeds from our revolving credit facility, stock option exercises, and excess tax benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P5_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for financing activities.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P6_S0	(6) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers and record these balances as deferred revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM6_P7_S0	(7) Long-term liabilities in 2016 includes $250.0 million of long-term debt.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	trends in the asset management industry, including the increasing popularity of passively managed investment vehicles.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	challenges faced by our non-U.S. operations, including the concentration of data and development work at our offshore facilities in China and India.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and individual investors.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook Data, through license agreements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	In our credit ratings business, we generate transaction-based revenue for our ratings on new issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our investment management business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client and region.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	In our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Deferred revenue is the second largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2016 , totaled $179.5 million (of which $165.4 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.1 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	At the end of 2015 , the amount of deferred revenue was $152.0 million (of which $140.7 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $11.3 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	In recent years, our deferred revenue balance has increased at a more moderate rate, partly because we've been issuing more quarterly and monthly invoices versus up-front, annual invoices.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	In addition, as we ve discontinued some subscription-based products such as Principia, we have less subscription-based revenue contributing to the deferred revenue balance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our acquisition of PitchBook in December 2016 also contributed approximately $24.0 million of deferred revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	This reflects our business focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	Cost of revenue also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases and data lines.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and other marketing professionals.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our capital expenditures are mainly for capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the United States and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We account for certain minority-owned investments, including Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK), using the equity method.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not build long-term shareholder value.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenue (including organic revenue); Operating income (loss); and Free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Organic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	For subscription-based products, we calculate a retention rate based on the number of subscriptions retained during the year as a percentage of the number of subscriptions up for renewal.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	After posting relatively modest returns in 2015 and beginning 2016 with significant volatility, the U.S. stock market finished 2016 on a stronger note.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year with a 12.4% gain.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	Morningstar s Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished the year up 6.4%.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Despite the more favorable market, the fund industry showed moderate growth in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total U.S. mutual fund assets edged up to $16.3 trillion as of December 31, 2016, compared with $15.6 trillion as of December 31, 2015, based on data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Based on Morningstar s analysis of fund flow trends, long-term mutual funds had aggregate net inflows of about $160 billion in 2016, down from about $200 billion in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios a trend that continued accelerating in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In 2016, passively managed funds had net inflows of more than $500 billion, while actively managed mutual funds suffered about $340 billion in net outflows.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2016 with $2.5 trillion in assets under management based on ICI data, up from about $2.1 trillion as of December 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Trends in online advertising by financial services companies were mixed in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	A report published by eMarketer in September 2016 estimated that global online advertising spending would increase by about 20% across all industries in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	However, sales trends for some sites have been weaker because of the industry-wide shift toward programmatic buying, which allows advertisers to digitally place keyword advertisements on a broad range of sites instead of working directly with content providers to place advertisements on one site.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Finally, political and regulatory uncertainty has made some of our clients more cautious, resulting in longer-than-usual sales cycles for some products and lower revenue growth for some of our license-based products.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	In 2016, the referendum by voters in the United Kingdom to exit the European Union added to this uncertainty.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	During any period of heightened market volatility and uncertainty, we typically experience delays in completing new client contracts and renewals.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	As clients spend more time trying to evaluate the long-term effects of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union as well as other geopolitical changes and risks, they may be reluctant to commit to larger contracts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	This creates some headwinds for us in terms of both new business and renewals.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	In addition to industry developments in 2016, there are several longer-term trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors, although UK regulators are reportedly considering changes to this restriction.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	In the European Union, the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, also known as MiFID II, is now scheduled to go into effect in January 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	In Australia, the government has continued to implement the series of Future of Financial Advice reforms that began in July 2013.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Some of these reforms include requirements relating to annual fee disclosure and compensation structures for financial advisors.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	In response, we believe financial advisors have become more focused on client engagement to demonstrate the value of the services they provide.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	In the United States, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a final version of a new fiduciary standard that would expand the definition of a fiduciary for certain financial advisors who provide advice related to retirement planning.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The new rule was previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	However, President Trump recently signed an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review the rule.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	It's unclear if implementation of the rule will be delayed or rolled back from what was previously anticipated.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Despite this uncertainty, we believe recent shifts, such as a greater emphasis on serving investors interests and lowering fees, are fundamental changes, that will continue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	We've introduced several new product offerings and bundled solutions to help financial advisors determine, demonstrate, and document that their advice is in the best interest of the investor.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	We believe Morningstar is well-positioned to help our clients adapt to this new landscape and have had many positive discussions with financial advisors and asset managers about the solutions we can provide.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	In particular, we ve increased our manager research coverage in response to growing demand for information that helps financial advisors show investors the thought process behind their investment recommendations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	(1) The asset totals shown above (including assets we either manage directly or for which we provide consulting or subadvisory work) only include assets for which we receive basis-point fees.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Some of our client contracts include services for which we receive a flat fee, but we do not include those assets in the total reported above.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	In the majority of our Investment Management business (except for Morningstar Managed Portfolios) it's difficult for us to quantify these cash inflows and outflows.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	(2) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.

1289419_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2016 and 2015, our consolidated revenue rose 1.2% and 3.8%, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Foreign currency movements were a factor in our 2016 results, although to a lesser extent than in 2015, as continued strength in the U.S. dollar reduced revenue from our international operations when translated into U.S. dollars.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	This has been an ongoing trend for several years and reduced revenue by $9.5 million in 2016 and $26.9 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We experienced modest revenue growth during 2016, as well as significant differences in trends between products, especially revenue from transaction-based fees.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Some of the main contributors to the 2016 revenue increase were Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, and Workplace Solutions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Positive results for these products were partially offset by decreases in Morningstar Credit Ratings (our structured credit ratings business) and Internet advertising sales on Morningstar.com.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	During 2016, we experienced more moderate growth rates for license-based products such as Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Data.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Revenue from Morningstar Direct was the biggest contributor to growth in both 2016 and 2015, with revenue increasing by $8.8 million in 2016 and $9.9 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to about 12,500 worldwide at the end of 2016, compared with about 11,400 at the end of 2015 and 10,000 at the end of 2014, with modest growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	Growth in Morningstar Direct reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Morningstar Data revenue also increased $7.6 million in 2016, mainly reflecting new contracts and renewals for managed products data and real-time data.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	In December 2016, we acquired the remaining interest in PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook), which contributed $4.1 million of revenue during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Products and services that mainly generate revenue from asset-based fees increased $6.2 million during 2016, mainly driven by strong growth in Workplace Solutions and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Revenue from Morningstar Credit Ratings decreased $11.3 million.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Negative trends in industry-wide issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to weigh down revenue for our credit ratings business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Industry-wide issuance volume for CMBS during 2016 was down about 25% compared with 2015, based on data from SIFMA, but showed some signs of improvement during the second half of 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	In addition to negative trends in issuance volume, competitive conditions have also created some revenue pressure for us in this area.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Revenue from Internet advertising sales on Morningstar.com also declined $5.7 million in 2016 as advertisers have continued shifting to programmatic buying platforms that target users on other sites.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	This has been an ongoing trend for several quarters.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The asset-based fees we earn are generally based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $192.6 billion in 2016, compared with $179.7 billion in 2015 and $167.3 billion in 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	We had $138.7 million in revenue from asset-based fees in 2016 , a 18.6% increase over 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	In 2014 , revenue from asset-based fees was $94.1 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	Revenue from asset-based fees made up approximately 17% of consolidated revenue in 2016 , an increase of 2.0 percentage points compared with 15% in 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2015 , some of the main contributors to the 3.8% increase in consolidated revenue were Morningstar Direct, Workplace Solutions, Morningstar Credit Ratings, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Positive results for these products were partially offset by decreases in Morningstar Enterprise Components and Principia, a product we discontinued.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	To make it easier to compare our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	During 2016, we acquired Requisight, LLC (RightPond), InvestSoft Technology, Inc. (InvestSoft), and PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	In November 2015, we acquired Total Rebalance Expert (tRx).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	In 2016 , we had $5.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	In addition, foreign currency translations reduced revenue by about $9.5 million in 2016 , mainly because of the weaker British pound and Canadian dollar.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 1.7% in 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	In 2015 , we had $4.1 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from ByAllAccounts and HelloWallet.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, foreign currency translations reduced revenue by about $26.9 million in 2015, mainly because of the weaker Euro, Australian dollar, British pound, and Canadian dollar.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 6.8% in 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	International revenue made up about 26% of our consolidated revenue in both 2016 and 2015 , compared with 28% in 2014 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Revenue from international operations increased $4.4 million, or 2.2% , in 2016 and international organic revenue increased 6.8% .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	In 2015, revenue from international operations decreased 2.7% and international organic revenue increased 10.2%.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	International revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue has been relatively flat the past few years, partly reflecting negative effects of foreign currency translations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The graph below illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data, Investment Advisory services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 96% in 2016 , compared with 99% in 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	The decrease mainly reflects lower renewal rates for some larger products, including Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Research.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal, as well as changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	In 2016 , we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products, including Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, Morningstar Office, and newsletter products, was approximately 66%, compared with 67% in 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decline was mainly driven by slightly lower retention rates for Morningstar.com Premium Memberships and Morningstar Office.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	In 2016 , our operating expense was up $19.6 million , or 3.3% .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Because of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $11.5 million in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $26.2 million in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	We had approximately 4,595 employees worldwide at the end of 2016, compared with 3,930 in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives and mainly includes technology, sales, and analyst roles in the United States, India, and China.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	The growth in compensation expense was partially offset by a $13.1 million reduction in bonus expense during 2016 compared to 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P89_S4	Bonus expense was lower mainly because we did not meet our internal targets for revenue growth during 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Depreciation expense, professional fees, and production expense also increased during 2016 as we continued to invest in our business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	We have also accelerated development of our major software platforms and therefore had an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	In 2016, we capitalized $28.2 million of software development expense for ongoing enhancements of key platforms and new development of upgraded software platforms.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	In comparison, we capitalized $21.8 million of software development expense in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sales commission expense decreased $2.8 million in 2016 , reflecting declines in new sales closed.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $7.5 million of operating expense, primarily for salaries, professional fees, and amortization expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	In 2015, our operating expense was down $56.3 million, or 8.6%.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	We settled a legal dispute for $61.0 million in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	In addition, foreign currency translations reduced operating expense by $23.9 million during 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Commission expense decreased $14.7 million in 2015, mainly because we changed to a new sales commission structure that requires a different accounting treatment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	In the first quarter of 2014, we started expensing sales commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the term of the underlying contracts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	However, we continued to amortize the prepaid commission balance from the previous commission plan.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	This amortization triggered an additional $3.5 million and $9.8 million of sales commission cost in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Legal and other professional fees were down $4.2 million in 2015, mainly reflecting litigation-related fees in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Also reducing operating expense was an increase in capitalized software development.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	In 2015, we capitalized $21.8 million of software development expense for ongoing enhancements of key platforms and new development of upgraded software platforms.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	In comparison, we capitalized a total of $18.8 million of software development expense in 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Compensation expense (including salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $6.3 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	While headcount remained relatively flat during the first nine months of the year, net headcount increased by about 100 employees during the fourth quarter as we continued to invest in our key growth initiatives.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Cost of revenue increased $14.2 million in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Higher salary expense of $19.9 million was the largest contributor to the increase and was mainly driven by additional headcount.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	Higher company-sponsored benefits and software subscriptions also contributed to the growth in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was a $9.1 million decrease in bonus expense, as well as an increase in capitalized software development.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	As mentioned above, we capitalized $28.2 million associated with software development activities in 2016, compared with $21.8 million included in 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $1.3 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for salary expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	In 2015, cost of revenue was up $11.5 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Higher salary expense of $7.9 million was the main reason for the increase, reflecting new hires we made to support the growth of our business as well as annual merit increases.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Higher expense for bonus, professional fees, and production expense also contributed to the change in this category.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was a higher level of capitalized software development, which reduced cost of revenue during 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	We capitalized $21.8 million associated with software development activities in 2015 versus $18.8 million in 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased 1.2 percentage points in 2016 and was unchanged in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $ 1.0 million in 2016, reflecting a $2.7 million increase in compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) and a $1.0 million increase in advertising and marketing spend.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	Partly offsetting these increases were decreases in sales commission expense of $1.9 million and bonus expense of $1.0 million.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $2.7 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for salary and sales commission expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Sales and marketing expense decreased $14.5 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Lower sales commission expense of $13.9 million (mainly reflecting the change in sales commission structure discussed above) as well as lower salary expense of $2.1 million were the primary contributors to the decrease.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	Partly offsetting these decreases was a $3.0 increase in advertising and marketing expense.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was unchanged in 2016 and down 2.4 percentage points in 2015 compared with 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	General and administrative expense decreased $1.9 million in 2016, mainly because of a $3.0 million decline in bonus expense and a $2.0 million decline in stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of $3.8 million in professional fees in connection with legal and compliance and other company initiatives.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) also increased $0.9 million.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $2.5 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for salary expense, professional fees, and stock-based compensation expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	General and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	Legal fees decreased $3.5 million as a result of litigation-related legal fees in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P112_S2	Salary expense also decreased $0.9 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P112_S3	These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in rent and utilities expense, mainly because of new and expanded office space in New York and London.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was down 0.4 percentage points in 2016 and 0.7 percentage points in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Overall, depreciation and amortization increased $6.3 million in 2016 and $9.5 million in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Depreciation expense rose $8.9 million in 2016 , mainly driven by higher capital expenditures for computer equipment and additional depreciation expense for capitalized software development.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.6 million in 2016 as certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $0.9 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for amortization expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	Depreciation expense rose $9.8 million in 2015, mainly because of higher capital expenditures for computer software and additional depreciation expense for capitalized software development.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	Intangible amortization expense increased $0.3 million in 2015, as certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions were fully amortized.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	We estimate that this expense will total approximately $24.4 million in 2017 , an increase from 2016, primarily because of the PitchBook acquisition.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, dispositions, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and foreign currency translation.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	We recorded a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense in the second quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015 or 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	This expense is included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and contributed nearly half of the increase in operating expense in 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Consolidated operating income decreased $9.8 million in 2016 as revenue increased $9.8 million and operating expense increased $19.6 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	Operating margin was 22.6% , down 1.6 percentage points compared with 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	Consolidated operating income increased $85.0 million in 2015 as our revenue increased $28.7 million and operating expense decreased by $56.3 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	Operating margin was 24.2% , an increase of 10.3 percentage points compared with 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P121_S2	The decrease in operating expense in 2015 mainly reflects the $61.0 million litigation settlement expense incurred in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table presents the components of non-operating income, net:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance of the credit facility we established in 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	Non-operating income in 2016 includes the $37.1 million gain we recorded with the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Non-operating income in 2014 included the $5.2 million gain we recorded with our purchase of the remaining ownership interest in HelloWallet, which was also previously a minority investment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	Other income, net primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of our business operations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entities primarily reflects income from Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) offset by losses in our other equity method investments.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 28.3% , a decrease of 3.8 percentage points compared with 32.1% in 2015, mainly because the $37.1 million holding gain recorded in connection with the December 2016 purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook was not taxable.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2015 was 32.1% , an increase of 0.8 percentage points compared with 31.3% in 2014, primarily reflecting higher state taxes.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $304.0 million , up $55.4 million from the end of 2015.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	The increase reflects cash provided by operating activities and $215.0 million of net borrowings under our credit facility primarily in connection with our December 2016 acquisition of PitchBook.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	These items were partially offset by $208.1 million used for acquisitions and purchases of minority investments, $62.8 million of capital expenditures, $48.8 million used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, and $37.9 million of dividends paid.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	In 2016 , cash provided by operating activities was $213.7 million , reflecting $208.5 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $5.2 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	In November 2016, we expanded our single-bank revolving credit facility in the United States, which we intend to use for general corporate purposes, from $100.0 million to $300.0 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	We had an outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million as of December 31, 2016, leaving borrowing availability of $50.0 million.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P134_S3	We were in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P135_S2	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P135_S3	We invest a portion of our investment balance (approximately $29.2 million, or 65% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2016 ) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P135_S4	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	Approximately 29% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2016 was held by our operations in the United States, up from about 26% as of December 31, 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	We do not expect to repatriate earnings from our international subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P136_S2	We have not recognized deferred tax liabilities for the portion of the outside basis differences (including unremitted earnings) relating to international subsidiaries because the investment in these subsidiaries is considered to be permanent in duration.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P136_S3	It is not practical to quantify the deferred tax liability associated with these outside basis differences.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	In December 2015, our board of directors approved a $300.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $1.0 billion .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	In 2016 , we repurchased a total of approximately 0.6 million shares for $49.5 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P138_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we had repurchased a total of 10.0 million shares for $672.9 million since we announced the share repurchase program in September 2010.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	In 2016 , we also paid dividends of $37.9 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	In February 2017 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 23 cents per share.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	The dividend is payable on April 28, 2017 to shareholders of record as of April 7, 2017 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P139_S3	We expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 23 cents per share in 2017 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	We expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2017 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	We also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2017 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $38.0 million related to the 2016 bonus.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P142_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	We generated free cash flow of $150.9 million in 2016 , a decrease of $33.3 million versus 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	The change reflects a $27.8 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $5.5 million increase in capital expenditures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	We generated free cash flow of $184.2 million in 2015, an increase of $105.9 million versus 2014.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	The change reflects a $104.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $1.0 million decrease in capital expenditures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	Free cash flow for 2014 included a $61.0 million cash outflow in connection with a litigation settlement.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	We paid a total of $267.1 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	We describe these acquisitions, including purchase price and product offerings, in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P149_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P151_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P151_S2	We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P151_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	Deferred revenue is the second largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2016 , totaled $179.5 million (of which $165.4 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.1 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P156_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P157_S2	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P158_S3	On occasion we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation experts for significant assets.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and non-compete agreements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P162_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P162_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P162_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P163_S2	We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P163_S3	If we determine that goodwill is impaired, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	For purposes of performing the impairment test, we determine fair values based on a discounted cash-flow methodology.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, long-term growth estimates, and determination of weighted average cost of capital.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	We believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	We measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S3	We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S4	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P166_S5	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	We believe the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	Because of timing differences required by tax law, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P170_S2	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P170_S3	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $55.0 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $91.6 million .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	The deferred tax assets include $3.0 million of deferred tax assets related to $14.6 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $6.8 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P173_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $36.9 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	If we determine a lower allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P174_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P175_S2	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P175_S3	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P175_S4	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P177_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P179_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P179_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required us to adopt it beginning on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S4	We elected the deferral, and the new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S5	The company has obtained an understanding of ASU No. 2014-09 and has begun to analyze the impact of the new standard on its financial results.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S6	We have completed a high-level assessment of the attributes within the company s contracts for its major products and services, and we have started assessing potential impacts to our internal processes, control environment, and disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P180_S7	While the company does not currently anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in a material change to the timing of when revenue is recognized and believes that it will retain similar accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under current standards, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new standard on our financial results and other possible impacts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	The company is in the process of determining the method of adoption it will elect and the impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	We will continue to provide enhanced disclosures as we continue our assessment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which provides guidance on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.

1289419_17_ITEM7_P182_S2	On May 6, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC guidance because of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2014-16 pursuant to staff announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , which rescinds the following SEC Staff Observer comments from ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , upon an entity's early adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : Revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including reseller of the vendor's products).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P182_S3	On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09 and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and clarify certain aspects of the standard.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P182_S4	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	The effective date and transition requirements for ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P184_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P184_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P184_S3	Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P186_S2	The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting after the effective date.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P186_S3	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-07 in the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P188_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P188_S2	Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-09 in the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P189_S2	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, where the cumulative effective of these changes are required to be recorded.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P189_S3	We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used for financing activities of $2.6 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in our consolidated cash flow statements because such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which reduces diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	The new guidance clarifies the classification of cash activities related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity-method investments, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P192_S2	The guidance also describes a predominance principle in which cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P193_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P193_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a retrospective transition method.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which revises the definition of a business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P196_S1	To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P196_S2	The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input and substantive process are present (including for early-stage companies that have not generated outputs).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	To be a business without outputs, there will now need to be an organized workforce.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P197_S1	The new guidance also narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1289419_17_ITEM7_P197_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P197_S3	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S2	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S4	Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S5	The same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S6	Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S7	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S8	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P198_S9	Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-05 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for office space.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	(2) The minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits).
1289419_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM7_P203_S2	The table excludes $5.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	These accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $304.0 million.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in the interest rates related to our long-term debt.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The interest rates are based upon the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin for such loans or the lender's base rate plus an applicable margin for such loans.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	On an annualized basis, based on December 31, 2016 estimated LIBOR rates, we estimate a 100 basis-point change in the LIBOR rate would have a $2.5 million impact.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The table below shows our exposure to foreign currency denominated revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 :
1289419_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The table below shows our net investment exposure in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2016 :

1289419_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Morningstar, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) , and our report dated February 28, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Morningstar Inc. s internal control over financial reporting.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited Morningstar, Inc. s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	Morningstar, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P8_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P8_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, Morningstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

1289419_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	We consolidate assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Certain amounts reported in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities as these relate mainly to investments tracking the strategies of our newsletter portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of equity securities, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 6 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which generally is three years.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	We include capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The table below summarizes our depreciation expense related to internally developed software for the past three years:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The table below summarizes our capitalized software development costs for the past three years:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	When we make acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their full fair values as of the date we obtain control, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P46_S4	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , on the acquisition date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	We did not record any impairment losses in 2016 , 2015 , or 2014 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P50_S4	We did not record any impairment losses in 2016 , 2015 , or 2014 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Delivery of our products and services has taken place.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, Premium Membership subscriptions for Morningstar.com, our structured credit ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	For new-issue ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Our Investment Management business includes a broad range of services.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Pricing for consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service provided, and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed and determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Our Workplace Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that provide administrative and record-keeping services) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	For our Workplace Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The revenue arrangements for Workplace Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed and determinable.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements combine multiple products and services.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of licenses or subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Through December 31, 2013, we paid sales commissions based on a formula driven by the total contract value of sales opportunities closed, with any subsequent adjustments (such as clawbacks for contract cancellations) reflected in future commission payouts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	We considered the corresponding commission expense an incremental direct acquisition cost and treated it as a deferred charge, which we expensed over the term of the underlying sales contracts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	In the first quarter of 2014, we modified our sales incentive plan.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	The revised plan is based on a combination of net new sales and specific business objectives not solely tied to revenue growth.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	Because of this new structure and the discretion involved in determining the related incentives, we started expensing sales commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the contract terms.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	However, we continued to amortize the deferred charge capitalized in connection with sales commissions paid in 2013 and previous periods as part of the previous incentive plan.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	This amortization added $0.6 million , $3.5 million , and $9.8 million of sales commission cost in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and stock options.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	For stock options, we estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	In some of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, Morningstar's full-time employees are generally eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave and include this liability in Accrued Compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	In November 2016, we amended and restated our credit agreement, which now provides us with a three -year credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The credit agreement also provides for issuance of up to $25.0 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	The interest rate applicable to any loan under the credit agreement is, at our option, either: (i) the applicable London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00% and 1.75% , based on our consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 2.00% and 2.75% , based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	We had an outstanding principal balance of $250.0 million at a one-month LIBOR interest rate plus 100 basis points as of December 31, 2016 , leaving borrowing availability of $50.0 million .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The following table shows the number of weighted average restricted stock units and performance share awards excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	We report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 2 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	We evaluate the performance of our reporting segment based on revenue and operating income.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The tables below summarize our revenue and long-lived assets by geographical area:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	We classify our investments into three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Our investment portfolio consists of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P87_S3	We classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized losses on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The table below shows the fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a fair value hierarchy:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting each of these investment categories in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, mutual funds, equity securities, and exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	In December 2016, we acquired an additional 78% interest in PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook), increasing our ownership to 100% from 22% .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	PitchBook delivers data, research, and technology covering the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on December 1, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P99_S2	PitchBook contributed $4.1 million of revenue and $7.5 million of operating expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	PitchBook's total preliminary estimated fair value of $235.1 million includes $188.2 million in cash paid to acquire the remaining 78% interest in PitchBook as well as a $46.9 million fair value related to our previous 22% ownership interest.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The book value of this ownership immediately prior to the acquisition date was $9.8 million , and we recorded a preliminary non-cash holding gain of $37.1 million for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held investment.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	We used the income approach and a discounted cash flow analysis of PitchBook s projected revenue, operating expense, and other amounts to arrive at the estimated fair value.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P100_S3	The gain is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary estimates of fair value available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may be adjusted during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition as further information becomes available.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P101_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the primary areas that are not yet finalized due to information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values assigned to various assets and liabilities, include the fair values of acquired intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities, assumed deferred revenue, as well as assumed tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, all of which are preliminary pending completion of the final valuation:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Accounts receivable acquired were recorded at gross contractual amounts receivable, which approximates fair value.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	We expect to collect substantially all of the gross contractual amounts receivable within a reasonable period of time after the acquisition date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	The preliminary allocation includes $60.7 million of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	We recognized a preliminary net deferred tax liability of $12.8 million mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	Preliminary goodwill of $193.6 million represents the excess over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer comprehensive data coverage across the full life cycle of private market transactions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The preliminary goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	We recognized a deferred tax liability of $3.6 million mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	We recognized a deferred tax asset of $8.6 million mainly because of net operating losses of HelloWallet which will become available to Morningstar.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	Goodwill of $39.2 million represents the premium over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to bring together HelloWallet's comprehensive financial wellness expertise with Morningstar's independent, research-based retirement advice to create a holistic retirement savings and advice offering.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	Most of our larger annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense annually in the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four -year period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	In 2014, we introduced a long-term incentive award program consisting of performance shares.

1289419_17_ITEM8_P164_S2	These awards entitle the holder to a number of shares of Morningstar common stock equal to the number of notional performance shares that become vested.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P164_S3	Each award specifies a number of performance shares that will vest if pre-established target performance goals are attained.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P164_S4	The number of performance shares that actually vest may be more or less than the specified number of performance shares to the extent Morningstar exceeds or fails to achieve, respectively, the target performance goals over a three -year performance period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	We base the grant date fair value for these awards on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to the grant date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the satisfaction of the performance condition that is most likely to be satisfied over the three -year performance period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	The table below shows target performance share awards granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for performance share awards granted as of December 31, 2016 :
1289419_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	In connection with our acquisition of PitchBook, we adopted a management bonus sub-plan under the 2011 Plan for certain employees of PitchBook (the PitchBook Plan).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P167_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the PitchBook Plan, awards having an aggregate target value equal to $30.0 million will be available for issuance with annual grants of $7.5 million for 2017, $7.5 million in 2018, and $15.0 million in 2019.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	Each grant will consist of performance-based share unit awards which will vest over a one -year period and will be measured primarily based on the achievement of certain annual revenue targets specifically related to PitchBook s business.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	Upon achievement of these targets, earned performance units will be settled in shares of our common stock on a one -for-one basis.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P168_S2	If PitchBook exceeds certain performance conditions, the PitchBook Plan participants may receive payment for performance units in excess of the aggregate target values described above.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P168_S3	If PitchBook fails to meet threshold performance conditions, the PitchBook Plan participants will not be entitled to receive payment for any performance units.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P168_S4	In certain circumstances, the PitchBook Plan participants may be able to receive a catch-up award with respect to 2017 or 2018 if certain additional performance conditions are met in a subsequent year.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P169_S0	The table below shows target performance share awards granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for performance share awards granted as of December 31, 2016 :

1289419_17_ITEM8_P170_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P170_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P171_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P171_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P171_S2	All options granted in 2011 have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P171_S3	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P171_S4	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2011 was $23.81 per share, based on the following assumptions:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following tables summarize stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P172_S1	The first table includes activity for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date; the second table includes activity for all other option grants.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2016 :
1289419_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P175_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $73.56 on December 30, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	In 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:

1289419_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P182_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The net increase in the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflects $23.9 million of acquired U.S federal NOLs from the acquisition of PitchBook in 2016 offset by $8.6 million of utilization of U.S. federal NOLs from prior acquisitions during 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $36.9 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	The decrease in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	We have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $171.6 million as of December 31, 2016 , because these earnings have been permanently reinvested.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P188_S1	It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P189_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $6.8 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P190_S1	In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P190_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P191_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P191_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2017 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P192_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $8.9 million and a non-current liability of $5.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P193_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $4.2 million and a non-current liability of $6.0 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P193_S2	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	In 2016 , we recorded a net increase of $4.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $3.1 million increased our income tax expense by $2.8 million .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P195_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $0.6 million for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $0.6 million decreased our income tax expense by $0.4 million .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $18.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $14.4 million , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $13.3 million .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P197_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	We recorded the decrease in the liability, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation that have arisen in the normal course of our business.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010 and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P200_S1	The authorization expires on December 31, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had repurchased a total of 10,028,125 shares for $672.9 million under this authorization, leaving approximately $327.1 million available for future repurchases.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S2	The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required us to adopt it beginning on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S4	We elected the deferral, and the new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S5	The company has obtained an understanding of ASU No. 2014-09 and has begun to analyze the impact of the new standard on its financial results.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S6	We have completed a high-level assessment of the attributes within the company s contracts for its major products and services, and we have started assessing potential impacts to our internal processes, control environment, and disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P203_S7	While the company does not currently anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in a material change to the timing of when revenue is recognized and believes that it will retain similar accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under current standards, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new standard on our financial results and other possible impacts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	The company is in the process of determining the method of adoption it will elect and the impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P204_S2	We will continue to provide enhanced disclosures as we continue our assessment.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which provides guidance on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P205_S1	On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P205_S2	On May 6, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC guidance because of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2014-16 pursuant to staff announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , which rescinds the following SEC Staff Observer comments from ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , upon an entity's early adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : Revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including reseller of the vendor's products).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P205_S3	On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09 and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and clarify certain aspects of the standard.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P205_S4	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	The effective date and transition requirements for ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P206_S1	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P207_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P207_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P207_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P207_S3	Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P208_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P209_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P209_S2	The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting after the effective date.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P209_S3	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-07 in the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P211_S2	Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-09 in the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P212_S1	The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P212_S2	Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, where the cumulative effective of these changes are required to be recorded.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P212_S3	We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used for financing activities of $2.6 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P213_S1	The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in our consolidated cash flow statements because such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which reduces diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	The new guidance clarifies the classification of cash activities related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity-method investments, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P215_S2	The guidance also describes a predominance principle in which cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a retrospective transition method.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which revises the definition of a business.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input and substantive process are present (including for early-stage companies that have not generated outputs).
1289419_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	To be a business without outputs, there will now need to be an organized workforce.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	The new guidance also narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1289419_17_ITEM8_P220_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P220_S3	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S2	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S4	Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S5	The same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S6	Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S7	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S8	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P221_S9	Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-05 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	(1) Non-operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $37.1 million holding gain related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We design disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, participated in and supervised this evaluation.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act meets the requirements listed above.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of PitchBook Data, which we acquired on December 1, 2016.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The operations of PitchBook Data constituted $283.3 million of our consolidated assets and $4.1 million of our consolidated revenue as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 .
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and incorporated herein by reference.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2016 , we completed the migration of our remaining international operations to the new version of our primary accounting system.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	This application is an integral part of our financial reporting process and materially affects our internal control environment over financial reporting.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , management is not aware of any control deficiencies related to this change.
1289419_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Other than the change noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_17_ITEM9B_P0_S0	There is no information that was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that was not reported.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Morningstar Rating for stocks is based on the stock's current price relative to our analyst-generated fair value estimates, as well as the company's level of business risk and economic moat.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our analysts cover approximately 1,500 stocks using a consistent, proprietary methodology that focuses on fundamental analysis, competitive advantage assessment, and intrinsic value estimation.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	In addition to our analyst-driven coverage, we provide quantitative ratings and reports for approximately 56,000 companies globally.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	These equity ratings draw on the fundamental research of our equity analyst team and provide a forward-looking statistical view of the valuation, competitive advantage, and level of uncertainty for stocks that are often under-followed by other research firms.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	PitchBook, which we acquired in December 2016, provides venture capital and private equity firms, corporate development teams, investment banks, limited partners, lenders, law firms, and accounting firms with a robust, all-in-one workstation that focuses on private capital markets.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	We use the concept of human capital-or potential future earning ability-to provide a more complete picture of an investor s financial worth and optimize a portfolio s asset mix.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our independence and our history of innovation make us a trusted resource for investors.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our strategy is to widen our economic moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, and build shareholder value by focusing on our three key objectives, which we describe in more detail below.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	1. Produce the most effective investment data, research, and ratings to help investors reach their financial goals.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe the quality and scope of our independent investment research offers a competitive advantage that would be difficult for competitors to replicate.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our goal is to leverage our proprietary research and intellectual property to help investors with both decision support (via Morningstar Direct and PitchBook) and outsourced investment management.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We re focusing our research efforts on several different areas, as described below.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our goal for manager research is to improve investor outcomes through ratings efficacy, coverage expansion, and innovation.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our analyst team qualitatively assesses thousands of managed investments using a structured and uniform approach.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	With the release of the Morningstar Quantitative Rating for Funds in the U.S., we have used machine-learning techniques to extend the qualitative Analyst Rating to thousands of funds that our analysts don t cover.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition, our analysts contribute to research and data innovations that we surface in the products and services we offer and oversee other ratings systems and tools that we offer to help investors make more-informed decisions when selecting securities, constructing portfolios, or measuring risk.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had about 120 manager research analysts, including teams in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our analysts follow a rigorous methodology that emphasizes a bottom-up, long-term, fundamentals-based valuation approach.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	We believe that our deep industry knowledge and Economic Moat TM Ratings, which identify sustainable competitive advantages, differentiate our equity research and help investors achieve better investment outcomes.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had about 100 equity analysts globally, making us one of the largest providers of independent equity research.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Over the past several years, we ve developed new research tools that provide a more holistic approach to investing and asset allocation.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Whereas traditional asset allocation methodologies focus solely on financial assets (such as stocks and bonds), we ve developed methodologies that provide a more complete view of all sources of wealth, including financial capital, human capital, housing assets, and retirement and pension benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Develop Morningstar Direct and PitchBook as our key decision support platforms.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	In 2017, we continued to develop the next-generation version of Morningstar Direct, our institutional investment research platform.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The new software is fully web-based, which eliminates the need for desktop software installations and allows immediate access to new features.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	It allows to us innovate more rapidly and more easily configure our software solutions to meet client needs.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	It also addresses the growing need for mobile-optimized capabilities to extend the desktop experience onto mobile devices.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Over the past several years, we've started migrating many of our core software capabilities to Morningstar Direct, which will serve as our main platform for clients seeking information to support the investment decisions they make on their own or to validate investment recommendations from another party.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	We're also continuing to expand the user base for Morningstar Direct by enhancing capabilities for our existing asset management clients and adding workflows for new types of clients, such as financial advisors.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	The PitchBook Platform is an all-in-one web-based research and analysis workstation centered on the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The PitchBook Platform also offers a mobile application, Excel plug-in, Chrome extension and optional CRM integrations, all designed to help users source deals, raise funds, build buyer lists, create benchmarks, network, and more.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Morningstar s in-depth public company fundamental data and institutional equity research were integrated into the platform, which when combined with PitchBook s best-in-class private market data, offers seamless access to cross-market insights, allowing institutional investors to better capitalize on opportunities in both public and private markets.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	We also doubled our private European company coverage.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	In 2017, PitchBook also launched a new interface and user experience, creating a more scalable product and helping users quickly uncover trends and opportunities.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	For example, the new Chrome extension allows users to instantly view hard-to-find company data while browsing other web content, thereby creating efficiency and value for users in their research.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	3. Build world-class investment management solutions based on our proprietary research.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	We leverage our innovative, proprietary research by building world-class investment management solutions that help investors achieve better outcomes.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Leveraging our existing capabilities, we create holistic solutions that help financial advisors, asset managers, and individual investors with portfolio construction, monitoring, security selection, and implementation.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Given the core capabilities discussed above, we're focusing on five primary customer groups:
1289419_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Financial advisors work with individual investors to help them reach their financial goals.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	This customer group includes independent advisors at registered investment advisor (RIA) firms, advisors affiliated with independent broker-dealers, dually registered advisors, and captive advisors who are employees of a broker-dealer.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	Such broker-dealers include wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, and banks.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The advisor landscape is broad in both the United States, and in other parts of the world where we focus.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	The U.S. is our largest market, and in total, Cerulli Associates estimates there were approximately 313,000 financial advisors in the U.S. as of the end of 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We believe our deep understanding of individual investors needs allows us to work with advisors to help them make more efficient use of their time and deliver better investment outcomes for their clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our advisor solutions also draw on Morningstar s proprietary investment research methodologies and research insights.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	We sell our advisor-related solutions both directly to independent financial advisors and through enterprise licenses, which allow financial advisors associated with the licensing firm to use our products.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We're expanding the range of services we offer to help financial advisors with all aspects of their daily workflow needs, including investment decision-making, portfolio construction, client monitoring and reporting, practice management, portfolio rebalancing that connects with custodial and trading interfaces, and financial planning.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Because advisors are increasingly outsourcing investment management, we're continuing to enhance Morningstar Managed Portfolios to help advisors save time and reduce compliance risk.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our main products for financial advisors are Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office) and Morningstar Managed Portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Asset management firms manage and distribute investment portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We estimate that there are more than 3,000 asset management firms globally, ranging from large, global firms to firms with small fund lineups and operations in a single market or region.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	The asset management customer group includes individuals involved in sales, marketing, product development, and distribution, as well as investment management (often referred to as the buy side ), which includes portfolio management and research.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our asset management offerings help companies connect with their clients because of Morningstar s strong brand presence with both financial advisors and individual investors.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	We offer a global reach and have earned investors trust in our unbiased approach, investor-centric mission, and thought leadership.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	In the U.S. workplace (also known as retirement) market, millions of investors are now charged with planning for their own retirement, mainly through self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k) plans in the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Assets in 401(k) plans totaled an estimated $5.6 trillion as of December 31, 2017, based on data from Cerulli Associates.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, we believe individual investors, financial advisors, employers, and government organizations have all become more aware of the need for advice and guidance that helps individuals build assets for retirement and beyond.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our retirement offerings help retirement plan participants of all ages plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that provide administrative and record-keeping services) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our main product offerings for the workplace/retirement customer group include retirement advice and managed accounts, fiduciary services, and custom models.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	We offer products for individual investors who invest to build wealth and save for other goals, such as retirement or college tuition.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	A Gallup survey released in April 2017 found that approximately 54% of individuals in the United States invest in the stock market either directly or through mutual funds or self-directed retirement plans.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We design most of our products for individual investors who are actively involved in the investing process and want to take charge of their own investment decisions.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We also reach individuals who want to learn more about investing or want to validate the advice they receive from brokers or financial advisors.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our main product for individual investors is Morningstar.com, which includes both paid Premium Memberships and free content available to registered users and visitors.

(PitchBook), which we acquired in December 2016, we reach approximately 2,700 investment and research firms and their service providers, including venture capital and private equity firms, corporate development teams, investment banks, limited partners, lenders, law firms, and accounting firms.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P119_S1	The goal of the project is to lower benchmarking costs for the industry and improve outcomes for investors in response to the escalating cost of market-cap-weighted equity indexes.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P119_S2	Participants receive price return, total return, net return, and month-end constituent data for indexes included in the project.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	We currently license Morningstar Indexes to numerous institutions that offer ETFs and exchange-traded notes based on the indexes.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P120_S1	Firms license Morningstar Indexes for both product creation (where we typically receive the greater of a minimum fee or basis points tied to assets under management) and data licensing (where we typically receive annual licensing fees).
1289419_18_ITEM1_P120_S2	In both cases, our pricing varies based on the level of distribution, the type of user, and the specific indexes licensed.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	We treat our brand name and logo, product names, databases and related content, software, technology, know-how, and the like as proprietary.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P123_S1	We seek to protect this intellectual property by using: (i) trademark, copyright, patent and trade secrets laws; (ii) licensing and nondisclosure agreements; and (iii) other security and related technical measures designed to restrict unauthorized access and use.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P123_S2	For example, we generally provide our intellectual property to third parties through the use of standard licensing agreements, which define the extent and duration of any third-party usage rights and provide for our continued ownership in any intellectual property furnished.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	Because of the value of our brand name and logo, we generally seek to register one or both of them as trademarks in all relevant international classes in any jurisdiction in which we have business offices or significant operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P124_S1	We have registered the Morningstar name and/or logo in approximately 50 jurisdictions, including the European Union, and currently have registrations pending in several others.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P124_S2	In some jurisdictions, we may also choose to register one or more product names.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	Morningstar and the Morningstar logo are both registered marks of Morningstar in the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	In addition to trademark registrations, we currently hold several patents in the United States, including a recently issued patent for a coordinate-based document processing system and several patents held by our wholly owned subsidiary, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, for lifetime asset allocation and asset allocation with annuities.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	We license our products and related intellectual property to our customers, generally for a fee.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	As a rule, we use our standard agreement forms and we do not provide our products and services to customers or other users without having an agreement in place.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	We maintain licensing agreements with most of our larger Morningstar operating companies around the world to allow them to access and use our intellectual property, including, without limitation, our products, trademarks, databases and content, technology, and know-how.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P128_S1	We put these agreements in place to allow our operating companies to both market standard Morningstar products and services in their operating territories and to develop and sell territory-specific variants of those products under the Morningstar name in their specific territories.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we obtain and use intellectual property from a wide variety of sources, including licensing it from third-party providers, developing it internally, and gathering it through publicly available sources (e.g., regulatory filings).
1289419_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	We believe our business has a minimal amount of seasonality.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	Some of our smaller products, such as our annual investment conference in Chicago, generate the majority of their revenue in the first or second quarter of the year.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P130_S2	We sell most of our products with subscription or license terms of at least one year, though, and we recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription or license agreement.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P130_S3	This tends to offset most of the seasonality in our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	We believe market movements generally have more influence on our performance than seasonality.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P131_S1	The revenue we earn from asset-based fees depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	In 2017, our largest customer accounted for less than 2% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	The economic and financial information industry includes a few large firms as well as numerous smaller companies, including startup firms.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P133_S1	Some of our main competitors include Bloomberg, S P Global, and Thomson Reuters.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	We believe the most important competitive factors in our industry are brand and reputation, data accuracy and quality, technology, breadth of data coverage, quality of investment research and analytics, design, product reliability, and value of the products and services provided.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	A key aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our investment research capabilities and enhance our existing products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	We strive to adopt new technology that can improve our products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P135_S2	As a general practice, we manage our own websites and build our own software rather than relying on outside vendors.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P135_S3	This allows us to control our technology development and better manage costs, enabling us to respond quickly to market changes and to meet customer needs efficiently.

1289419_18_ITEM1_P180_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located at 22 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	We maintain a website at http://www.morningstar.com/company.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents are available free of charge on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	We also post quarterly press releases on our financial results and other documents containing additional information related to our company on this site.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P181_S3	We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only.
1289419_18_ITEM1_P181_S4	That information is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our investment management operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Three of our subsidiaries, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, Morningstar Investment Services LLC, and Morningstar Research Services LLC, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As registered investment advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	These requirements relate to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As registered investment advisors, these subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, in cases where these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our subsidiaries outside the United States that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Such activities have been the subject of increasing class action litigation in recent years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	For example, in 2017, a participant in a pension plan filed a putative class action proceeding against us alleging that we, together with other defendant parties, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by allegedly engaging in actions to steer plan participants into high-cost investments that pay unwarranted fees to the defendants.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We are vigorously contesting this proceeding, which is described in more detail in Item 3 of this Form 10-K under Legal Proceedings.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had $57.6 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We could face substantial liabilities related to our management of these assets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Problems could arise if these programs assigned retirement plan participants to the wrong portfolios, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Clients may take legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on the quality and outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty, or based on our investment management fees and expenses.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on approximately $195 billion in assets as of December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest or by other negative publicity or media reports.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We believe independence is at the core of our business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We rely on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us could damage our reputation as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment research and information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as any negative publicity or media reports about Morningstar, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation and damage our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	For instance, in October 2017, The Wall Street Journal ran an article critical of our fund star and analyst ratings.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We publicly and comprehensively disputed the assertions made in the article, but the publication of such an article illustrates the risks of negative publicity to our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered by our institutional clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also provide investment advisory and investment management services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In some cases, we make investment recommendations (such as Select Lists) within the framework of client constraints.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	While we don t charge asset management firms for their products to be rated, we do charge licensing fees for the use of our ratings.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We also receive payments from issuers for our new-issue ratings on various types of asset-backed securities and corporate bond issues.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These payments may create the perception that our ratings, research, and recommendations are not impartial.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	This perception may undermine the confidence of our customers and potential customers in our reputation as a provider of independent research.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Any such loss of confidence or damage to our reputation could hurt our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment products.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to produce competitive performance in our investment management offerings.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Failing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools may harm our competitive position and business results.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We attribute much of our company's success over the past 34 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	More recently, we ve developed unique concepts and tools such as the Wealth Forecasting Engine, Gamma, Total Wealth Approach, and Best Interest Scorecard.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We believe these innovations set us apart because most of our competitors focus on providing data or software rather than creating their own proprietary research frameworks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also believe our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools is at the core of what drives Morningstar s value for all of our customer groups.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we fail to continuously innovate and develop new tools to meet the needs of our customers, our competitive position and business results may suffer.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we re perceived as not moving quickly enough to meet the changing needs of investors.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Clients may also delay purchases of our currently offered research tools in anticipation of us offering new products or enhanced versions of existing products.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools that gain attention from our clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We believe lower technology costs, the growth of open software platforms, and cloud computing technologies have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Smaller companies, including startup firms funded by private equity and venture capital, may be able to move more quickly to develop research and tools that gain a wide following.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, the value of our data, research and software tools may be negatively affected by the increasing amount of information and tools that are available for free, or at low cost, through internet sources or other low-cost delivery systems.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although we believe our products and services contain value-added features and functionality that deeply embed them in our customers workflows, such developments may over time reduce the demand for, or customers willingness to pay for, certain of our products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and frameworks, we may not generate enough interest from potential clients to win new business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition, we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources often before knowing whether such investments will result in products or services that satisfy our clients needs or generate revenues sufficient to justify such investments.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, from time to time, we also incur costs to transition clients to new or enhanced products or services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Such transitions can involve material execution risks and challenges.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If we are unable to manage these investments and transitions successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Failing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Examples include the shift from local network computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, and rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our software development process is based on frequently rolling out new features so that we can quickly incorporate user feedback.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we fail to develop and implement new technology rapidly enough, we may sacrifice new business opportunities or renewals from existing customers.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may also incur additional operating expense if major software projects take longer than anticipated.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, if our execution speed is too slow, or if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our results could suffer if the mutual fund industry continues to experience slower growth, if actively managed equity funds continue to attract less investor attention, or if the industry continues to meaningfully consolidate.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds, and part of our growth since 1984 can be attributed to favorable industry trends.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 to 40 years, but suffered during the market downturn of 2008 and 2009.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Since then, fund assets have increased, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Some of that slower growth is attributable to the growth of ETFs as a mutual fund alternative, and we have accordingly expanded our research coverage and analyst ratings to include ETFs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, ETFs generally track passive investing strategies and charge lower management fees than active strategies, which may affect both the profitability of asset managers, on whose success we in part depend, and the perceived value of our research regarding ETFs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Over the past 15 years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend has accelerated in recent years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In 2017, actively managed mutual funds suffered about $7 billion in net outflows, compared with net inflows of more than $690 billion for passively managed funds.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Overall, we estimate that passively managed portfolios now account for more than one-third of combined mutual fund and ETF assets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The growth of online wealth management tools that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice, sometimes called robo-advice, may further accelerate the adoption of passively managed portfolios and reduce demand for our data and analyst research.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The growth of the mutual fund industry is also being affected by increasing merger and acquisition activity within the asset management industry, which is reducing the number of asset managers offering mutual funds and ETFs, the pruning by some mutual fund and ETF platforms of the number of funds available for purchase, and the continuing impacts of regulation, such as MiFID II s requirement that asset managers pay banks and brokers for investment research, which may be a competitive advantage for larger asset managers better able to absorb such costs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Prolonged downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could continue to reduce investor interest and investment activity.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for our products, including our software, data, and analyst research.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business continuity program may not be adequate in the event of a material emergency affecting one or more of our United States or offshore business centers or adverse political or regulatory developments in countries in which we have significant data and development operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have approximately 1,360 employees working at our corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These include most of our executive leadership team as well as substantial numbers of employees involved in the delivery of most of our major products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If our headquarters were to become unusable due to a natural disaster, a violent incident or another dangerous emergency, we might not be able to continue business operations at an acceptable level that would meet all our legal and contractual commitments.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our failure to successfully implement and deploy a business continuity plan, either at an enterprise level or with respect to particular business centers, could materially affect our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We now have approximately 950 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control and the relationship between the United States and China is experiencing a period of increased political, military, and commercial tensions, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Laws and regulations relating to data privacy, security, and protection of intellectual property rights in China, as well as the enforcement environment for such laws and regulations, are in certain cases uncertain and evolving.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, this facility is subject from time to time to extreme weather events.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The concentration of certain types of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for parts of our network infrastructure.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	While we have short-term backup plans in place, it would be difficult for us to maintain and update our mutual fund database if we were unable to access our Shenzhen operations for an extended period of time.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have approximately 935 employees who work at our data collection, technology and operational center in Mumbai, India.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These employees maintain and update our equity database and provide shared services to many of our operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	This location is subject to extreme weather events and political unrest, including public protests which can disrupt transportation and make it difficult for employees to commute to and from work.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The electrical infrastructure of Mumbai is also subject to more frequent interruptions than are experienced at our other major facilities.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, Mumbai has experienced and may in the future experience terrorist attacks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	While we have short-term backup plans in place to address such business continuity issues, it would be challenging for us to maintain and update our equity database or continue to provide certain shared services to our worldwide operations if we were unable to access our Mumbai operations for an extended period of time.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	PitchBook, which we acquired in December 2016, has approximately 230 contract employees based in Calcutta and Pune, India who support its data and research operations and approximately 100 contract employees based in Ukraine who work on software development.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Ukraine has been subject to significant political unrest and military incursions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Any disruption to PitchBook's contract operations in these locations would make it difficult for PitchBook to meet its operating goals.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We could face liability related to our storage of personal information about individuals as well as portfolio and account-level information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Customers routinely enter personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information, on our websites.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, we handle increasing amounts of personally identifiable information in areas such as Morningstar Retirement Manager, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, ByAllAccounts, Morningstar Office, Enterprise Data Management, and Morningstar.com.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	ByAllAccounts uses technology to collect, consolidate, and transform financial account data and deliver it to any platform, and accordingly handles a large volume of personally identifiable information as part of its normal business operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Any failure to safeguard this information could damage our reputation and business results.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We must continuously invest in systems, processes, and controls to guard against the risk of improper access to this information, which could be disclosed through employee errors, other inadvertent release, social engineering, failure to restrict access, or failure to properly purge and protect data.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may suffer malicious attacks by individuals or groups seeking to attack our products and services or penetrate our network and databases to gain access to personal data or to launch or coordinate distributed denial of service attacks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	These attacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated, and difficult to detect.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Contractual commitments to customers as well as laws and industry regulations related to data protection, system availability, and privacy require us to safeguard critical data.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We are also required to take appropriate steps to safeguard credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other information about individuals or their accounts.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become effective in May 2018, will among other things impose stringent additional requirements regarding the information to be provided to, and the consents required from, individuals to justify a business using their personal data, as well as new rights of data subjects to be forgotten, data portability rights and the right to object to certain automated decision-making processes.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Given the growing concern over data privacy and identity theft, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to increased scrutiny by clients and regulators.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	We could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately collect, retain, or disclose any user's personal information or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any user's name, address, Social Security number, account numbers, portfolio holdings, credit card information, or other personal information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We could also be subject to liability if we fail to meet the requirements of laws and regulations such as the GDPR, which contemplate substantial enterprise-level penalties for non-compliance, in a timely or thorough manner.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit rating operations could adversely affect our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our investment management operations are a growing part of our overall business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The securities laws and other laws that govern our investment advisory activities are complex.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The activities of our investment advisory operations are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act and ERISA.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P46_S5	If we fail to comply with securities laws and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Over the past several years, we have also made significant investments in our credit rating business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC subsidiary is an NRSRO that specializes in structured finance, corporate credit issuers, and financial institutions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Credit rating and research providers continue to be subject to intensive regulatory scrutiny.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	As an NRSRO, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to various requirements and regulations under the Exchange Act relating to, among other things, record-keeping, reporting, governance, and conflicts of interest.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	As part of its NRSRO registration, Morningstar Credit Ratings is subject to annual examination by the SEC, as well as periodic investigations by the SEC and other governmental authorities relating to matters of regulatory interest such as industry practices and personnel matters.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P47_S5	The cost and management distraction resulting from such examinations and investigations may have a negative effect on our credit rating business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our index business could be negatively affected by increased regulation of benchmarks generally, which could increase the costs and risks of producing and administering indexes.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such regulations may discourage market participants from continuing to use, administer or contribute to indexes, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies relating indexes, and/or lead to declining demand for indexes.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The laws, rules, and regulations, and their interpretations, applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes without extensive changes to our business practices.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, the broad scope of our business operations makes it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory, credit rating or index services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We rely primarily on our computer equipment, database storage facilities, and other network equipment, which is located across multiple facilities in the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We also have extensive information systems outside the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our mission-critical databases and networks are complex and interdependent, which increases the risk of failure.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Problems in our network systems may lead to cascading effects involving product downtime, overloading of third-party data centers, and other issues that may affect our clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	To defend against these threats, we implement a series of controls focusing on both prevention and detection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, automated scanning and testing, server hardening, anti-virus software, training, and patch management.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We make significant investments in servers, storage, and other network infrastructure to prevent incidents of network failure and downtime, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will work as planned.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Most of our products and services currently depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet, although we are shifting the delivery of several of our products and services to cloud-based delivery systems.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our data, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our headquarters.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our gradual movement of parts of our technological infrastructure to the public cloud and software as a service (SaaS) solutions presents a variety of additional risks, including risks relating to sharing the same computing resources with other users, the use by cloud and SaaS providers of virtualization products and various security issues relating thereto, reliance on cloud and SaaS providers authentication, authorization and access control mechanisms, a lack of control over cloud and SaaS providers redundancy systems and fault tolerances, and a reduced ability to directly address client concerns over data security and privacy.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Any disruption of or interference with our use of the public cloud or SaaS solutions, or any information security breach at any cloud or SaaS provider, could materially impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Over time, a growing dependence of our technology infrastructure on the public cloud and SaaS solutions also risks us becoming overly dependent on particular suppliers, which could adversely affect the pricing we receive from such suppliers and limit our ability to transition away from such suppliers in the event of service-quality issues.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Downturns in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may hurt our results, resulting in lower revenue from asset-based fees, transaction-based revenue, or other parts of our business.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our business results are partly driven by factors outside of our control, including general economic and financial market trends.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Any unfavorable changes in the environment we operate in could cause a corresponding negative effect on our business results.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As a result, we may experience lower revenue, operating income, and other financial results in the event of a market downturn.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Many of our customers are asset management firms and other financial services companies, which are also subject to external trends and changes.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	For example, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to spending cutbacks among many of the companies to which we sell.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Some institutional clients have implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Some institutional clients have also reduced the scope of their operations, and merger and acquisition activity in the asset management sector has in the past, and may in the future, reduce the number of potential asset management clients.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Many companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation and pressure to reduce fees.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In turn, many of these firms have sought to reduce their operating costs by working with fewer service providers and/or negotiating lower fees for services they purchase.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In addition, our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines, cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage, and the industry-wide trend toward lower asset-based fees.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In 2017, asset-based revenue made up approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The amount of asset-based revenue we earn primarily depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In 2017, the U.S. and many international markets experienced substantial valuation increases.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These market trends were highly favorable in terms of the value of assets we have under management or advisement, but there can be no assurance that these trends will continue and, if they do not, our asset-based revenue may be negatively affected.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Asset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	A drop in net inflows or an increase in redemptions can result from a variety of factors, including overall market conditions and volatility or a decline in investment performance.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales, which made up about 3% of consolidated revenue in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Many advertisers have shifted some of their advertising spend to programmatic buying platforms that target users on other sites, which has from time to time had a negative effect on advertising revenue for our website for individual investors, Morningstar.com.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We are uncertain whether this trend will continue.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our structured credit rating business, which made up about 3% of consolidated revenue in 2017, is subject to volatility from trends in new issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If industry-wide issuance for such securities declines, our revenue associated with this line of business may also go down.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We have also expanded our coverage to include corporate credit issuers and financial institutions, which are also subject to volatility in issuance patterns based on market conditions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our PitchBook Data business may also be subject to cyclical trends.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Many of PitchBook's clients are investment banks and other participants in the capital and merger and acquisition markets, which are subject to periodic business downturns driven by changes in such markets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	During these downturns, they often seek to reduce spending on third-party services as well as the number of employees, which would directly affect the number of prospective clients for PitchBook.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	As a data and research provider focusing on the private capital markets (including venture capital, private equity, and M A), PitchBook may also be subject to volatility based on the amount of activity and market interest in these areas.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our acquisitions and other investments may not produce the results we anticipate.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We have also incurred debt in connection with acquisitions, which may limit our financial flexibility.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We've completed numerous acquisitions over the past 10 years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	This acquisition presents several potential challenges and risks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	We may not achieve the growth targets that we established for PitchBook at the time of the acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	The process of integration may require more resources than we anticipated.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S4	We may assume unintended liabilities or experience operating difficulties or costs that we did not anticipate.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S5	We may also fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business, including PitchBook founder and chief executive officer John Gabbert, which would make it difficult to follow through on our operating goals for the acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S6	If our acquisition of PitchBook does not generate the results we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P69_S7	We may also fail to generate enough revenue or profits from this acquisition to earn a positive return on the associated purchase price.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	To fund this acquisition, we increased the principal amount available for borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility to $300.0 million and extended the term of this facility to three years.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Under the terms of our agreement with the lender, we are now subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants, which may limit our financial flexibility.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	As of December 31, 2017, borrowings in the principal amount of $180.0 million remain outstanding under such facility.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	In 2017, we purchased a 40% interest in Sustainalytics Holding B.V. (Sustainalytics), a leading global provider of environmental, social and governance (ESG) research and ratings.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	While we obtained various rights in connection with that investment, including representation on Sustainalytics Board of Directors, we do not own a controlling interest in Sustainalytics and the future value of our investment is highly dependent on the management skill of the managers of Sustainalytics.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve a number of risks.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	They can be time-consuming and may divert management s attention from day-to-day operations, particularly if numerous acquisitions are in process at the same time.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities, reduce our financial flexibility because of reductions in our cash balance, or result in a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We experience competition for analysts, technology experts, and other employees from other companies and organizations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman and controlling shareholder.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	At the end of 2016, Joe changed his role to focus less on our day-to-day business operations, but he remains heavily involved our strategy and overall company direction.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	The loss of Joe, our chief executive officer, Kunal Kapoor, or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	We do not have employment agreements, non-compete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our operations outside of the United States involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our operations outside of the United States generated $224.7 million in revenue in 2017, or about 25% of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	There are risks inherent in doing business outside the United States, including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We could face liability for the information we publish or the reports and other documents produced by our software products, including information, reports and documents based on data we obtain from other parties.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and ratings on issuers of structured credits and corporate credits.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Clients of our software products used by advisors or asset managers or governmental regulation of such clients may make claims against us based on software or data errors that affect investment reporting or client billing.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Even though most of our contracts for such products contain limitations of our liability in such cases, we may be required to make such clients or their customers whole for any losses in order to maintain our business relationships.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P81_S4	We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We also incorporate data from a variety of third-party sources for PitchBook Data.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We could be subject to claims by providers of publicly available data and information we compile from websites and other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of the source s copyrights or terms of use, or based on the provisions of new legislation such as GDPR that limits the bases on which businesses can collect personal information from and about individuals.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We could also be subject to claims from third parties from which we license data and information that we have used or re-distributed the data or information in ways not permitted by our license rights.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Failure to protect our intellectual property rights , or claims of intellectual property infringement against us, could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret rights, as well as contractual protections and technical safeguards, to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Despite these efforts, third parties may still attempt to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our rights or improperly obtain our proprietary information.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	From time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Our continued ability to use the Morningstar name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name or otherwise.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We have from time to time been subject to claims by third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Such claims can also be alleged against clients, customers, or distributors of our products or services whom we have agreed to indemnify against third party claims of infringement.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	The defense of such claims can be costly and consume valuable management time and attention.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, which can include the payment of damages, the entry into royalty or licensing arrangements on commercially unfavorable terms, or the suspension of our ability to offer affected products or services.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S4	If litigation were to arise from any such claim, there can be no certainty we would prevail in it.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P87_S5	If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Control by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2017, Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman, owned approximately 57% of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	As a result, he has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	He also has the ability to control our management and affairs.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P89_S3	This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control; impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar; discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company; or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In addition, because we manage our business with a long-term perspective, we generally don t make significant adjustments to our strategy or cost structure in response to short-term factors.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	As a result, our operating results may suffer in the short term.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S4	In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may not always reflect the intrinsic value of our business and assets.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P91_S6	If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	A reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P93_S2	In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price.
1289419_18_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.
1289419_18_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We do not have any unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.
1289419_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we leased approximately 457,000 square feet of office space for our U.S. operations, primarily for our corporate headquarters located in Chicago, Illinois.
1289419_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also lease another 435,000 square feet of office space in 26 other countries around the world, including approximately 141,000 square feet in Shenzhen, China.
1289419_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We believe that our existing and planned office facilities are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute space is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	In August 2017, Michael D. Green, individually and purportedly on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaint names as defendants Morningstar, Inc., Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co., and contains one count alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
1289419_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Plaintiff, a participant in a pension plan, alleges that the defendants engaged in concerted racketeering actions to steer plan participants into high-cost investments that pay unwarranted fees to the defendants.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages for plaintiff and the members of the putative class, treble damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys fees.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	Morningstar has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which is fully briefed and under advisement by the court.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Although Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claim asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	Other Matters We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and litigation that arise in the normal course of our business.
1289419_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MORN.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table shows the high and low price per share of our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market:
1289419_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 16, 2018 , the last reported sale price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for our common stock was $96.55 per share, and there were 1,164 shareholders of record of our common stock.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	See Note 12 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our equity compensation plans.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table shows dividends declared and paid for the periods indicated:
1289419_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	We paid four dividends during 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	Due to timing, we declared two dividends during the fourth quarter of 2017, one at 23 cents per share and one at 25 cents per share.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P5_S2	While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share in 2018 .
1289419_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P6_S1	Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	We had an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P8_S1	The authorization expired on December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P8_S2	On December 8, 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P8_S3	The authorization expires on December 31, 2020.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	The following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made during the three months ended December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM5_P10_S0	Our directors and executive officers may exercise stock options or purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P10_S1	We encourage them to make these transactions through plans that comply with Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c).
1289419_18_ITEM5_P10_S2	Morningstar will not receive any proceeds, other than proceeds from the exercise of stock options, related to these transactions.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P10_S3	The following table, which we are providing on a voluntary basis, shows the Rule 10b5-1 sales plans entered into by our directors and executive officers that were in effect as of February 15, 2018:
1289419_18_ITEM5_P11_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2017, the previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 sales plan for Steven Kaplan, Gail Landis, and Jack Noonan completed in accordance with their terms.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P12_S0	_______________________________ (1) This column reflects an estimate of the number of shares Gail Landis will beneficially own following the sale of all shares under the Rule 10b5-1 sales plan.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P12_S1	This information reflects the beneficial ownership of our common stock on December 31, 2017, and includes shares of our common stock subject to options that were then exercisable or that will have become exercisable by March 1, 2018 and restricted stock units that will vest by March 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P12_S2	The estimates do not reflect any changes to beneficial ownership that may have occurred since December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM5_P12_S3	Gail may amend or terminate her Rule 10b5-1 sales plan and may adopt additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected historical financial data shown below should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have derived our Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The Consolidated Statements of Income Data and Consolidated Cash Flow Data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and Consolidated Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Operating income and free cash flow for 2014 included a $61.0 million litigation settlement expense and corresponding cash outflow.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Non-operating income in 2016 included a $37.1 million holding gain related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	Non-operating income in 2017 includes a $16.7 million gain related to the sale of HelloWallet.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC regulations.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	We present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P3_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required to be reported under GAAP, nor should this data be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P3_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, capital expenditures, purchases of equity and cost- method investments, and proceeds from the sale of businesses.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	The level of investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these categories.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P4_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for investing activities.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program and dividend payments.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P5_S1	These cash outflows are partially offset by proceeds from our revolving credit facility, stock option exercises, and excess tax benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P5_S2	Refer to Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information concerning cash used for financing activities.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	(6) We frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers and record these balances as deferred revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P6_S1	These amounts represent both current and non-current deferred revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM6_P7_S0	(7) Long-term liabilities in 2016 and 2017 includes $250.0 million and $180.0 million of long-term debt, respectively.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion included in this section, as well as other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	These statements are based on our current expectations about future events or future financial performance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	For us, these risks and uncertainties include, among others:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	the failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of intellectual property infringement against us.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results may vary significantly from what we expected.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	All dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as increase, decrease, grew, declined, was up, was down, was flat, or was similar refer to a comparison with the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.

1289419_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We offer an extensive line of products and services for individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors in the private capital markets.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a result, we typically generate recurring revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	We generate revenue by selling a variety of investment-related products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We sell many of our products and services, including Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook Data, through license agreements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our license agreements typically range from one to three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	We sell some of our other products, such as Premium Membership service on Morningstar.com, via subscriptions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	These subscriptions are mainly offered for a one-year term, although we offer terms ranging from one month to three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S5	We also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P5_S6	In our credit ratings business, we generate transaction-based revenue for our ratings on new issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured credits.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our investment management business has multiple fee structures, which vary by client and region.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	In general, we seek to receive asset-based fees for any work we perform that involves managing investments or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	For any individual contract, we may receive flat fees, variable asset-based fees, or a combination of the two.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	Some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level, above which we also receive variable asset-based fees.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	In the majority of our contracts that include variable asset-based fees, we bill clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	Other contracts may include provisions for monthly billing or billing based on assets as of the last day of the billing period rather than on average assets.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	In our Workplace Solutions area, our contracts may include one-time setup fees, technology licensing fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We also offer plan sponsor advice and custom target-date consulting arrangements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	For Morningstar Managed Portfolios, we charge asset-based fees, which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Deferred revenue is the largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2017 , totaled $185.5 million (of which $171.3 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	At the end of 2016 , the amount of deferred revenue was $179.5 million (of which $165.4 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.1 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	In recent years, our deferred revenue balance has increased at a more moderate rate, partly because we've been issuing more quarterly and monthly invoices versus up-front, annual invoices.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	In addition, as we ve discontinued some subscription-based products, we have less subscription-based revenue contributing to the deferred revenue balance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our acquisition of PitchBook in 2016 also contributed to the increase in deferred revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary software, databases, and content.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	While the fixed costs of the investments we make in our business are relatively high, the variable cost of adding customers is relatively low.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	This reflects our business focus on Internet-based platforms and assets under management.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	At times, we may make investments in building our databases and content that cause weaker short-term operating results.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	During other periods, our profitability may improve because we're able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	When revenue decreases, however, we may not be able to adjust our cost base at a corresponding rate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	We include stock-based compensation expense, as appropriate, in each of these categories.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	This reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Cost of revenue also includes other expense such as third-party data purchases and data lines.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and marketing professionals.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We also include the cost of advertising, direct mail campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our capital expenditures are mainly for capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had majority-owned operations in 26 countries outside of the United States and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	We account for certain minority-owned investments, including Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK), using the equity method.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts but may not build long-term shareholder value.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Organic revenue and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Organic revenue is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	We present free cash flow as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	To evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue, we calculate retention and renewal rates using two different methods.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	For subscription-based products, we calculate a retention rate based on the number of subscriptions retained during the year as a percentage of the number of subscriptions up for renewal.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	For products sold through contracts and licenses, we use the contract value method, which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount, unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	We also include variable-fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter's actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees, migrations to other Morningstar products, and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We use these insights to help inform our company strategy, product development plans, and marketing initiatives.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	2017 was a strong year for equities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	With the bull market in U.S. equities fast approaching its nine-year anniversary, we ve seen a growing tendency for diversification outside of the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	Morningstar's U.S. Market Index, a broad market benchmark, ended the year with a robust 21.5% gain; however, international equities as a group fared slightly better.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	Morningstar s Global Markets ex-U.S. Index finished the year up 28.0%, with the Developed Markets ex-U.S. Index up 25.5% and the Emerging Markets Index up almost 36.0%.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	However, all bond categories were still able to deliver healthy returns because the long end of the yield curve was relatively flat in the last year.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Based on Morningstar Asset Flows data, total U.S. mutual fund assets edged up to $18.1 trillion as of December 31, 2017, compared with $15.1 trillion as of December 31, 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	ETFs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The U.S. ETF industry closed out 2017 with $3.4 trillion in assets under management based on Morningstar Asset Flows data, up from about $2.5 trillion as of December 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Based on our analysis of fund flow trends, long-term mutual funds and exchange traded products had aggregate net inflows of about $680 billion in 2017, up significantly from about $160 billion in 2016, and outpacing the most recent record of $460 billion set in 2014.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Net outflows in actively managed mutual funds slowed to $7 billion in 2017 versus $340 billion in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Nevertheless, the overall decline remains consistent with the trend of investor preference for passively managed funds, which experienced over $690 billion in net inflows in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	In addition to industry developments in 2017, there are several longer-term trends we consider relevant to our business, as outlined below.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, regulators have continued to implement new frameworks for financial services companies globally.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Many of these rules relate to financial advisor compensation, fees and expenses, investor disclosure, and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	In the United Kingdom, for example, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees, higher professional standards for financial advisors, and "whole of market" investment solutions, became effective in January 2013.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The RDR also restricted the use of commission payments for products sold to individual investors, although UK regulators are reportedly considering changes to this restriction.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The UK regulator is monitoring the implementation of RDR and is scheduled to publish a review of its findings in 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	In addition to the RDR, the UK regulator and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) launched the Financial Advice Market Review (FAMR) in 2015 in light of concerns that the market for financial advice was not working well for consumers.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	FAMR aimed to explore ways in which the government, industry, and regulators could take collective steps to stimulate the development of a market which delivers affordable and accessible financial advice and guidance to everyone.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	FAMR's final report, published in March 2016, set out 28 recommendations intended to tackle barriers to consumers accessing advice.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	The FCA and HMT will review the outcomes of FAMR in 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	In the European Union, the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, also known as MiFID II, became effective in January 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The main provisions include, among other things, limits on portfolio managers' use of third-party research, quality and organizational rules regarding the provision of advice, additional governance requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and structured deposits, requirements for firms to provide clients with details of all costs and charges related to their investments, and new rules for disclosing the cumulative effect of costs on investor returns.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	With respect to indexes, European Union Benchmarks Regulation 2016/1011 came into force on June 30, 2016 with a majority of its provisions having a compliance date of January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The principal objective of the Regulation is to ensure benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (e.g., a tracking index of a ETF) are free of conflicts of interest, are used appropriately and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	This Regulation applies to Morningstar s index group as a result of making available its indexes to European investable product sponsors (e.g., ETF sponsors) as the tracking index for their investable product.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In Australia, in an effort to improve trust and confidence in the financial services industry, the government has announced many regulatory reforms and inquiries ranging from enhanced enforcement powers for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), new reforms to significantly raise the professional, educational and ethical standards of financial advisors, and a Royal Commission into the alleged misconduct of Australia's banks and other financial services entities with broad terms of reference and the potential to impact many aspects of the financial services industry.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	ASIC has been actively enforcing the Future of Financial Advice reforms that began in July 2013 with actions against financial advisors who failed to act in the best interest of clients and a review of the five largest vertically integrated financial institutions and their management of conflicts of interest.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The fund management industry also continues to be an area of regulatory reform with the introduction of the Asia Region Funds Passport and Corporate Collective Investment Schemes, the implementation of new costs and fee disclosure for managed investment and superannuation funds, and a proposed update and overhaul of regulatory guidance for fund managers.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	In the United States, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a final version of a new fiduciary standard that would expand the definition of a fiduciary for certain financial advisors who provide advice related to retirement planning.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The new rule was previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Parts of the rule went into effect in June 2017 but full implementation of the rule has been pushed back to July 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	The SEC is also considering possible rulemaking in this area.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	In December 2017, the SEC released its updated agenda of regulatory priorities in 2018 and beyond, which listed rulemaking regarding a Personalized Investment Advice Standard of Conduct (i.e., a fiduciary standard) as being at the shorter-term proposed rulemaking stage.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Despite this uncertainty, we believe recent shifts, such as a greater emphasis on serving investors interests and lowering fees, are fundamental changes that will continue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	We've introduced several new product offerings and bundled solutions to help financial advisors determine, demonstrate, and document that their advice is in the best interest of the investor.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	We believe Morningstar is well-positioned to help our clients adapt to this new landscape and have had many positive discussions with financial advisors and asset managers about the solutions we can provide.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	In particular, we ve increased our manager research coverage in response to growing demand for information that helps financial advisors show investors the thought process behind their investment recommendations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The tables below summarize our key product metrics and other supplemental data.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	(1) Included for informational purposes only; Morningstar did not acquire full ownership of PitchBook until December 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	(2) The asset totals shown above (including assets we either manage directly or for which we provide consulting or subadvisory work) only include assets for which we receive basis-point fees.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Some of our client contracts include services for which we receive a flat fee, but we do not include those assets in the total reported above.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Excluding changes related to new contracts and cancellations, changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources: gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance, and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Except for Morningstar Managed Portfolios, it's difficult for our Investment Management business to quantify these cash inflows and outflows.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The information we receive from most of our clients does not separately identify the effect of cash inflows and outflows on asset balances for each period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	We also cannot specify the effect of market appreciation or depreciation because the majority of our clients have discretionary authority to implement their own portfolio allocations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	(3) Many factors can cause changes in assets under management and advisement for our managed retirement accounts, including employer and employee contributions, plan administrative fees, market movements, and participant loans and hardship withdrawals.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances caused by market movement.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	(5) Revised to include assets from South Africa.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	(6) Decline due to client losses related to a strategic shift away from our customized investment management offerings to Managed Portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	(7) Includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and corporate and financial institutions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	(8) Revised to exclude temporary employees and part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	(9) Key product and investment area revenue and revenue by type includes the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	(10) Revised to exclude Morningstar Office.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Excluding the negative 6.5 percentage point impact of the HelloWallet divestiture, revenue increased by 9.7% for the full year.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	(12) License-based revenue includes Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, Morningstar Enterprise Components, Morningstar Research, PitchBook Data, and other similar products.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	(13) Asset-based revenue includes Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, and Morningstar Indexes.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	(14) Transaction-based revenue includes Morningstar Credit Ratings, Internet advertising sales, and Conferences.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Please refer to the discussion in How We Evaluate our Business for more detail.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2017 and 2016 , our consolidated revenue rose 14.2% and 1.2% , respectively.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our acquisition of PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook) in December 2016 contributed $57.2 million of revenue growth during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	Foreign currency movements had no net material impact on revenue in 2017 and reduced revenue by $ 9.5 million in 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We experienced strong revenue growth across all revenue types during 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	License-based revenue grew 15.6% during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	We experienced stronger growth rates for license-based products such as Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Data.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Revenue from Morningstar Direct was the biggest contributor to growth in both 2017 and 2016 , with revenue increasing by $13.9 million in 2017 and $8.8 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	The number of licenses for Morningstar Direct increased to 13,884 worldwide at the end of 2017, compared with 12,492 at the end of 2016 and 11,428 at the end of 2015, with modest growth in both the United States and internationally.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	Growth in Morningstar Direct reflects additional licenses for both new and existing clients.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Morningstar Data revenue increased $10.9 million in 2017, mainly reflecting new contracts and renewals for managed products data and our market data business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Asset-based revenue increased 10.3% during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Morningstar Managed Portfolios and Workplace Solutions were the primary drivers of the increase.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The asset-based fees we earn are generally based on average asset levels during each quarter.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Average assets under management and advisement (calculated based on available average quarterly or monthly data) were approximately $207.9 billion in 2017 , compared with $192.8 billion in 2016 and $179.9 billion in 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Transaction-based revenue grew 11.1% during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Revenue from Morningstar Credit Ratings (our structured credit ratings business) increased $5.0 million during the year, primarily due to new-issue growth in asset-backed securities partially offset by a slight decrease in ratings on commercial mortgage-backed securities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Some of the main contributors to the 2016 revenue increase were Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Data, and Workplace Solutions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Positive results for these products were partially offset by decreases in Morningstar Credit Ratings and Internet advertising sales on Morningstar.com.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	In December 2016, we acquired the remaining interest in PitchBook, which contributed $4.1 million of revenue during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	To make it easier to compare our results in different periods, we provide information about organic revenue, which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	In 2017, we divested HelloWallet and did not make any acquisitions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	During 2016, we acquired Requisight, LLC (RightPond), InvestSoft Technology, Inc. (InvestSoft), and PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	We did not divest any businesses in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Contribution from PitchBook was treated as acquired revenue through November 2017 and was incorporated into organic growth statistics after December 1, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Because HelloWallet was divested in the second quarter of 2017, we excluded HelloWallet's last six months of 2016 revenue from our organic revenue growth calculation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2017 , we had $57.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Revenue in 2016 included $4.4 million of revenue from HelloWallet, which we divested in the second quarter of 2017, and that did not recur in the second half of 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, foreign currency translations had no net material impact on revenue in 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 7.6% in 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	In 2016 , we had $5.5 million in incremental revenue from acquisitions, primarily from PitchBook.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	In addition, foreign currency translations reduced revenue by about $9.5 million in 2016 , mainly because of the weaker British pound and Canadian dollar.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency translations, organic revenue was up 1.7% in 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	The tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Organic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	Organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	International revenue made up about 25% of our consolidated revenue in 2017 , compared with 26% in both 2016 and 2015 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	About 60% of our international revenue is from Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	We also have a fairly large revenue base in Australia and Canada.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revenue from international operations increased $16.6 million, or 8.0% , in 2017 and international organic revenue increased 8.0% .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	In 2016, revenue from international operations increased 2.2% and international organic revenue increased 6.8%.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The tables below present a reconciliation from international revenue to international organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations):
1289419_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	International revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue has been relatively flat the past few years, partly reflecting negative effects of foreign currency translations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	International organic revenue (international revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The definition of international organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	International organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	As discussed in How We Evaluate Our Business, we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	The graph below illustrates these two metrics over the past five years:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	For contract-based products and services (such as Morningstar Data including PitchBook, Investment Advisory services, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation), we estimate that our weighted average annual renewal rate was approximately 102% in 2017 , compared with 96% in 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase mainly reflects higher renewal rates for some larger products, including Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Investment Management, Workplace Solutions, Morningstar Research, and PitchBook.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	The figure for contract-based products includes the effect of price changes; increasing client bases upon contract renewal; changes to the contract value upon renewal (such as increased users); and changes in the value of variable-fee contracts.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	These factors, therefore, can lead to a renewal rate percentage over 100%.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2017 , we estimate that our annual retention rate for subscription-based products, including Morningstar.com's Premium Membership service, Morningstar Office, and newsletter products, was approximately 66%, which was unchanged from 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	In 2017 , our operating expense was up $124.1 million , or 20.1% .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $0.6 million in 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $76.0 million of operating expense, primarily for salaries, amortization expense, professional fees, commission expense, and management bonus expense during the year.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	PitchBook expenses exceeded revenue in 2017, primarily due to $10.6 million of deal-related intangible amortization and $7.9 million of vesting of performance share awards associated with the acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	PitchBook also had $4.6 million of capitalized labor during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The remaining increase was primarily a result of higher compensation expense (including salaries, bonus, and other company-sponsored benefits), depreciation expense, professional fees, and production expense, which includes third-party data and infrastructure hosting.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Excluding PitchBook, compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $16.2 million in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	Bonus expense also increased $14.5 million in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	Bonus expense was higher due to stronger performance against our internal targets.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Depreciation expense in 2017 includes a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud-based strategy.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Partially offsetting our total operating expense increase was an increase in internally developed capitalized software.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	We have accelerated development of our major software platforms, resulting in an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	In 2017, we capitalized $41.7 million, which excludes the PitchBook capitalized labor noted above, associated with software development activities, mainly related to Morningstar Data, Workplace Solutions, and additional enhancements to reporting, financial planning, and other capabilities in our products.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	In comparison, we capitalized $28.2 million of software development expense in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We had approximately 4,920 employees worldwide at the end of 2017, compared with 4,550 in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives, including data operations in India and China and PitchBook in the United States and Europe.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	In 2016, our operating expense was up $19.6 million, or 3.3%.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency translations reduced our operating expense by $11.5 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $26.2 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	We had approximately 4,550 employees worldwide at the end of 2016, compared with 3,880 in 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	This increase reflects continued investment in our key growth initiatives and mainly includes technology, sales, and analyst roles in the United States, India, and China.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	The growth in compensation expense was partially offset by a $13.1 million reduction in bonus expense during 2016 compared to 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P93_S4	Bonus expense was lower mainly because we did not meet our internal targets for revenue growth during 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Depreciation expense, professional fees, and production expense also increased during 2016 as we continued to invest in our business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	We have also accelerated development of our major software platforms and therefore had an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	In 2016, we capitalized $28.2 million of software development expense for ongoing enhancements of key platforms and new development of upgraded software platforms.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	In comparison, we capitalized $ 21.8 million of software development expense in 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Sales commission expense decreased $2.8 million in 2016, reflecting declines in new sales closed.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $7.5 million of operating expense, primarily for salaries, professional fees, and amortization expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	We include compensation expense for approximately 80% of our employees in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Cost of revenue increased $42.3 million , or 12.3% , in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $14.0 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for professional fees, salary expense, and capitalized labor during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	The remaining increase was largely due to higher salary expense of $13.6 million, mainly driven by additional headcount.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	Higher bonus expense, professional fees, and production expense also contributed to the increase in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in internally developed capitalized software.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	We have accelerated development of our major software platforms, resulting in an increase in capitalized software development, which reduced operating expense.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	During 2017, we capitalized $41.7 million, which excludes the PitchBook capitalized labor noted above, associated with software development activities, mainly related to Morningstar Data, Workplace Solutions, and additional enhancements to reporting, financial planning, and other capabilities in our products.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	In comparison, we capitalized $28.2 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cost of revenue increased $14.2 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Higher salary expense of $19.9 million was the largest contributor to the increase and was mainly driven by additional headcount.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	Higher company-sponsored benefits and software subscriptions also contributed to the growth in this category.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Partially offsetting these increases was a $9.1 million decrease in bonus expense, as well as an increase in capitalized software development.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	As mentioned above, we capitalized $28.2 million associated with software development activities in 2016, compared with $21.8 million included in 2015 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	PitchBook contributed $1.3 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for salary expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2017 and increased 1.2 percentage points in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $36.7 million , or 37.6% , in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $34.9 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for salary and sales commission expense in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	The remaining increase was due to an increase in sales commission expense of $3.7 million, partially offset by decreases in compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits), advertising and marketing spend, and professional fees.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Sales and marketing expense increased $1.0 million in 2016, reflecting a $2.7 million increase in compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) and a $1.0 million increase in advertising and marketing spend.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	Partly offsetting these increases were decreases in sales commission expense of $1.9 million and bonus expense of $1.0 million.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $2.7 million during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense increased 2.5 percentage points in 2017 and was unchanged in 2016 compared to 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	General and administrative expense increased $24.6 million , or 23.3% , during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $16.1 million of operating expense in this cost category, primarily for management bonus plan expense and salary expense during 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	Bonus expense, software subscriptions, and rent expense contributed to the remaining increase in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	General and administrative expense decreased $1.9 million in 2016, mainly because of a $3.0 million decline in bonus expense and a $2.0 million decline in stock-based compensation expense.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of $3.8 million in professional fees in connection with legal and compliance and other company initiatives.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	Compensation expense (including salaries and other company-sponsored benefits) also increased $0.9 million.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	PitchBook contributed $2.5 million in 2016, primarily for salary expense, professional fees, and management bonus plan expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was up 1.0 percentage points in 2017 and down 0.4 percentage points in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	Overall, depreciation and amortization increased $20.5 million , or 28.9% , in 2017 and $6.3 million , or 9.9% , in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our acquisition of PitchBook contributed $11.0 million of operating expense in this cost category in 2017 and $0.9 million in 2016, primarily for intangible amortization expense related to the acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	Depreciation expense rose $16.3 million in 2017 , mainly driven by depreciation expense related to capitalized software development and computer equipment incurred over the past several years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	Depreciation expense during 2017 also includes a $4.1 million impairment charge for certain software licenses due to a shift toward a cloud- based strategy.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P115_S2	Intangible amortization expense increased $4.2 million in 2017 due to additional amortization expense for the intangible assets of PitchBook offset by certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions that are now fully amortized.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	Depreciation expense rose $8.9 million in 2016, mainly driven by higher capital expenditures for computer equipment and additional depreciation expense for capitalized software development.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	Intangible amortization expense decreased $2.6 million in 2016 as certain intangible assets from some previous acquisitions are now fully amortized.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	We expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	We estimate that this expense will total approximately $20.7 million in 2018 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful lives, and foreign currency translation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	Consolidated operating income decreased $11.0 million in 2017 as revenue increased $113.1 million and operating expense increased $124.1 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	Operating margin was 18.6% , down 4.0 percentage points compared with 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	Consolidated operating income decreased $9.8 million in 2016 as revenue increased $9.8 million and operating expense increased $19.6 million.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	Operating margin was 22.6% , down 1.6 percentage points compared with 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	We reported adjusted operating income, which excludes PitchBook, of $182.2 million in 2017 and $184.1 million for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P120_S1	Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure; the table below shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	We present adjusted operating income (operating income excluding PitchBook) to show the effect of this acquisition, to better reflect period-over-period comparisons, and improve overall understanding of our current and future financial performance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	We reported an adjusted operating margin, which excludes PitchBook, of 21.5% in 2017 and 23.2% in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure; the table below shows a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	We present adjusted operating margin (operating margin excluding PitchBook) to show the effect of this acquisition, better reflect period-over-period comparisons, and improve overall understanding of our current and future financial performance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table presents the components of non-operating income, net:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	Interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance of the credit facility we established in 2014.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	Gain on sale of business relates to our sale of HelloWallet in June 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	Non-operating income in 2016 includes the $37.1 million gain we recorded with the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	Other income (expense), net primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from resulting from U.S. dollar denominated short-term investments held in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entities primarily reflects income from Morningstar Japan K.K. (MJKK) offset by losses in our other equity method investments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	We describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	The following table summarizes the components of our effective tax rate:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	The legislation also causes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a new tax on U.S. cross-border payments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P131_S2	Furthermore, the legislation includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	In response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	While our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $10.6 million discrete net tax benefit in our 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	This net benefit is primarily comprised of a $14.7 million provisional deferred tax benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	We have also recorded a provisional tax charge of $7.5 million payable over 8 years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S3	This tax expense is offset by the provisional tax benefit of a $6.4 million reduction of a deferred tax liability previously recorded for our foreign equity method investments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S4	We have also recorded a provisional expense of $3.0 million for the establishment of a deferred tax liability related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S5	However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are evaluating the accounting impacts of the legislation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S6	As part of our evaluation, we will continue to assemble and analyze all of the information required to quantify the effects of the legislation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S7	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P133_S8	See Note 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	For a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2017 was 23.9% , a decrease of 4.4 percentage points compared with 28.3% in 2016, primarily because of the provisional tax impacts of the new U.S. tax legislation detailed above.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 28.3% , a decrease of 3.8 percentage points compared with 32.1% in 2015, mainly because the $37.1 million holding gain recorded in connection with the December 2016 purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook was not taxable.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $353.3 million , up $49.3 million from the end of 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	The increase reflects cash provided by operating activities and proceeds of $23.7 million related to the sale of HelloWallet.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P137_S2	These items were partially offset by $70.0 million of repayments of long-term debt, $66.6 million of capital expenditures, and $42.3 million used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, of which $0.7 million was repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2016 but settled and paid early in the first half of 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P137_S3	Dividends paid of $39.3 million and purchases of equity-method investments of $24.8 million also offset the cash inflows.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	In 2017 , cash provided by operating activities was $250.1 million , reflecting $226.8 million of net income, adjusted for non-cash items and $23.3 million in positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	In November 2016, we amended our credit agreement to provide us with a three-year credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	We had an outstanding principal balance of $180.0 million as of December 31, 2017, leaving borrowing availability of $120.0 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P139_S2	The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P139_S3	We were in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	We invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	We maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P140_S3	We invest a portion of our investment balance (approximately $23.1 million, or 51% of our total investments balance as of December 31, 2017 ) in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P140_S4	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	Approximately 69% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2017 was held by our operations outside the United States, down from about 71% as of December 31, 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	In December 2015, our board of directors approved a $300.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized under the program to $1.0 billion .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	The authorization expired on December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P143_S2	On December 8, 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P143_S3	The authorization expires on December 31, 2020.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	In 2017 , we repurchased a total of approximately 0.5 million shares for $41.9 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had repurchased a total of 10.6 million shares for $714.8 million since we announced the share repurchase program in September 2010.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	In 2017 , we also paid dividends of $39.3 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	In February 2018 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	The dividend is payable on April 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 6, 2018 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	We expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 25 cents per share in 2018 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	We expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2018 , primarily for computer hardware and software, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	We have commenced migrating our infrastructure to the cloud.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P146_S2	The migration will have some transitional effects on our level of capital expenditures and operating expenses and we expect to maintain certain redundant infrastructure prior to a full transition.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	We also expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of 2018 to make annual bonus payments of approximately $48.2 million related to the 2017 bonus compared to $38.0 million in 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	As described in more detail above, we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P148_S2	Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under GAAP.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	We generated free cash flow of $183.5 million in 2017 , an increase of $32.6 million versus 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	The change reflects a $36.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $3.8 million increase in capital expenditures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	We generated free cash flow of $150.9 million in 2016, a decrease of $33.3 million versus 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	The change reflects a $27.8 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $5.5 million increase in capital expenditures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	We paid a total of $203.7 million , less cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	We describe these acquisitions in Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	We paid a total of $47.5 million related to purchasing additional investments in unconsolidated entities over the past three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	We describe these investments in Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	We sold HelloWallet in 2017 and received a total of $ 23.7 million related to this sale.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	For more information, please see Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P157_S3	Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P157_S4	If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	Much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for data, software, and Internet-based products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P159_S3	We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition, including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	For contracts that combine multiple products and services, we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	Delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	If arrangements include an acceptance provision, we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections and assess the probability of collection on a case-by-case basis.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions, licenses, or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P164_S1	Deferred revenue is the second largest liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and, at the end of 2017 , totaled $185.5 million (of which $171.3 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $14.2 million included in other long-term liabilities).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P164_S2	We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription, license, and service agreements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	We believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate, and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P166_S2	Allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and non-compete agreements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We consider various approaches to value the intangible assets.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets; and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S3	For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S4	We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S5	Instead, it is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist, based on a discounted cash-flow model.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S6	We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P170_S7	If we determine that goodwill is impaired, we reduce the goodwill balance to reflect the revised fair value.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	For purposes of performing the impairment test, we determine fair values based on a discounted cash-flow methodology.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, long-term growth estimates, and determination of weighted average cost of capital.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P171_S2	We believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations and subsequent goodwill impairment testing are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	We include stock-based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, and market stock units.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	We measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the award's vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day before the grant.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S2	We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S3	We later adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S4	Therefore, changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not change the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P173_S5	Instead, different forfeiture assumptions would only affect the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	We believe the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	As a result of the U.S. tax reform and the related SEC guidance, we included provisional estimates in our consolidated financial statements for some impacts of the new tax legislation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	See Note 14 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	Our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	Because of timing differences required by tax law, the effective tax rate reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return (our cash tax rate).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	Some of these differences, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, are permanent.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P178_S2	Other differences, such as depreciation expense, reverse over time.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P178_S3	These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $34.5 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $56.1 million .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	The deferred tax assets include $3.1 million of deferred tax assets related to $14.8 million of net operating losses (NOLs) of our non-U.S. operations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P181_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.4 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P181_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $9.1 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence, including tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income, and recent financial performance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P182_S1	If we determine a lower allowance is required at some point in the future, we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P182_S2	These adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P182_S3	This would cause our income tax expense, effective tax rate, and net income to fluctuate.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	We use judgment to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts of uncertain tax positions to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P183_S1	We recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P183_S2	We adjust these liabilities, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P183_S3	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P183_S4	The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	We use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	We generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	It typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P185_S2	We recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	Assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	These legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and government actions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P187_S2	Assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P187_S3	If actual results differ from our assessments, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would be affected.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P188_S2	The original effective date for ASU No. 2014-09 would have required us to adopt it beginning on January 1, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P188_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P188_S4	We elected the deferral, and the new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	We have obtained an understanding of ASU No. 2014-09 and have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of the new standard on our financial results.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	We have completed a high-level assessment of the attributes within our contracts for our major products and services, and we have assessed the impacts to our internal processes, control environment, and disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P189_S2	We have determined that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will not result in a material change to the timing of when revenue is recognized and we intend to retain similar accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under current practices.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P189_S3	We have identified that there will be certain changes in accounting treatment related to delivery of third-party content (principal vs. agent) and costs to obtain contracts (e.g., sales commissions).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	The change related to delivery of third-party content (principal vs. agent) is expected to result in no impact on our consolidated operating income; however it will result in a increase in both revenue and cost of revenue versus prior periods of approximately $6 million to $7 million as revenue will be recognized on a gross rather than net basis for certain arrangements.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	The change related to the capitalization of cost to obtain contracts is expected to result in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $25 million to $30 million for commission expenses which were previously expensed.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	We expected to amortize this adjustment over a period not to exceed three years and expect 2018 commission expense resulting from this change will range between $14 million and $16 million.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P191_S2	Additionally, in 2018 we will expense any discretionary payments made under our commission plans as well as pro-rata portions of any new commission amounts paid in 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	We plan to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P192_S2	Upon adoption, we will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as noted above.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P192_S3	Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted and we will discuss the comparability of these adjustments within our 2018 results against the prior periods.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	We are continuing to evaluate the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statement presentation and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P193_S1	We expect expanded disclosures related to the revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability (i.e., deferred revenue) balance at the beginning of the period.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P193_S2	We also plan to provide additional disclosures on our unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period and expected timing of when that contract liability will be recognized into revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which provides guidance on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.

1289419_18_ITEM7_P194_S2	On May 6, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC guidance because of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2014-16 pursuant to staff announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , which rescinds the following SEC Staff Observer comments from ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , upon an entity's early adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : Revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including a reseller of the vendor's products).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P194_S3	On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09 and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and clarify certain aspects of the standard.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P194_S4	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	The effective date and transition requirements for ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P195_S1	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P196_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P196_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P196_S3	Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P197_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P198_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which reduces diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P198_S1	The new guidance clarifies the classification of cash activities related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity-method investments, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P198_S2	The guidance also describes a predominance principle in which cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P199_S0	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P199_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P199_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a retrospective transition method.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P200_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P201_S0	On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which revises the definition of a business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P202_S0	When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P202_S1	To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P202_S2	The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input and substantive process are present (including for early-stage companies that have not generated outputs).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P203_S0	To be a business without outputs, there will now need to be an organized workforce.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P203_S1	The new guidance also narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1289419_18_ITEM7_P203_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P203_S3	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S0	On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S2	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S4	Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S5	The same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S6	Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S7	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S8	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P204_S9	Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P205_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P206_S0	On May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting , which clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P206_S1	Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P206_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P206_S3	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P206_S4	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P207_S0	The table below shows our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations:
1289419_18_ITEM7_P208_S0	(1) The non-cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for office space.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P209_S0	(2) The minimum payments on the credit facility reflect the current outstanding principal balance of $180.0 million and an estimate for interest and commitment fees.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P210_S0	(3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits (including penalties and interest, less the impact of any associated tax benefits).
1289419_18_ITEM7_P210_S1	The amount included in the table represents items that may be resolved through settlement of tax audits or for which the statutes of limitations are expected to lapse during 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P210_S2	The table excludes $7.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, included as a long-term liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 , for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment.
1289419_18_ITEM7_P211_S0	(4) U.S. federal income tax on deemed mandatory repatriation is payable over 8 years pursuant to the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	These accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $353.3 million.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in the interest rates related to our long-term debt.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The interest rates are based upon the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin for such loans or the lender's base rate plus an applicable margin for such loans.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	On an annualized basis, based on December 31, 2017 estimated LIBOR rates, we estimate a 100 basis-point change in the LIBOR rate would have a $1.8 million impact.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the United States.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.
1289419_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The table below shows our exposure to foreign currency denominated revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 :

1289419_18_ITEM8_P4_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P4_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2011.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Morningstar, Inc.:

1289419_18_ITEM8_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1289419_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	We consolidate assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	We account and report the noncontrolling (minority) interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	A noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent company.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	We report the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity separate from the shareholders' equity attributable to Morningstar, Inc.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	In addition, we present the net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Morningstar, Inc.'s shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of Equity.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the United States that are considered variable interest entities.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	For the majority of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest in them.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	We state them at cost, which approximates fair value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	We state the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds at fair value, as these funds are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	We account for our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	We classify our investments into three categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Trading: We classify certain other investments, primarily equity securities, as trading securities as these relate mainly to investments tracking the strategies of our newsletter portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	We include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments as a component of our operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of equity securities, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	We record these securities at their fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	We follow FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances and does not require any new fair value measurements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to valuation under FASB ASC 820 in Note 6 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	No single customer is large enough to pose a significant credit risk to our operations or financial condition.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	If receivables from our customers become delinquent, we begin a collections process.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the probable losses of accounts receivable.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	We depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which generally is three years.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Computer Software and Internal Product Development Costs.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software , FASB ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs, and FASB ASC 985, Software .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Internal product development costs mainly consist of employee costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	We include capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service in our construction in progress balance.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The table below summarizes our depreciation expense related to internally developed software for the past three years:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The table below summarizes our capitalized software development costs for the past three years:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	When we make acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	We follow FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired operation as a whole, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their full fair values as of the date we obtain control, regardless of the percentage ownership in the acquired operation or how the acquisition was achieved.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as advisory, accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , on the acquisition date.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	We performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	We did not record any impairment losses in 2017 and 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 25 years.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, Subsequent Measurement Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P48_S4	We did not record any impairment losses in 2017 and 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition , ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple Element Arrangements , and ASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Delivery of our products and services has taken place.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	We generate revenue through sales of Morningstar Data, Morningstar Advisor Workstation (including Morningstar Office), Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Research, Premium Membership subscriptions for Morningstar.com, our structured credit ratings offerings, and a variety of other investment-related products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	We generally structure the revenue agreements for these offerings as licenses or subscriptions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	We recognize revenue from licenses and subscription sales ratably as we deliver the product or service and over the service obligation period defined by the terms of the customer contract.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	For new-issue ratings and analysis for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), other asset-backed securities (ABS), and corporate and financial institutions, we charge asset-based fees that are paid by the issuer on the rated balance of the transaction and recognize the revenue immediately upon issuance.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	We also generate revenue from Internet advertising, primarily from impression-based contracts.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	For advertisers who use our cost-per-impression pricing, we charge fees each time we display their ads on our site.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Our Investment Management business includes a broad range of services.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	Pricing for consulting services is based on the scope of work and the level of service provided and includes asset-based fees for work we perform that involves investment management or acting as a subadvisor to investment portfolios.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	In arrangements that involve asset-based fees, we generally invoice clients quarterly in arrears based on average assets for the quarter.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P55_S3	We recognize asset-based fees once the fees are fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Our Workplace Solutions offerings help retirement plan participants plan and invest for retirement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	We offer these services both through retirement plan providers (typically third-party asset management companies that provide administrative and record-keeping services) and directly to plan sponsors (employers that offer retirement plans to their employees).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	For our Workplace Solutions offerings, we provide both a hosted solution as well as proprietary installed software advice solution.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	Clients can integrate the installed customized software into their existing systems to help investors accumulate wealth, transition into retirement, and manage income during retirement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	The revenue arrangements for Workplace Solutions generally extend over multiple years.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Our contracts may include one-time setup fees, implementation fees, technology licensing and maintenance fees, asset-based fees for managed retirement accounts, fixed and variable fees for advice and guidance, or a combination of these fee structures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Upon customer acceptance, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	We recognize asset-based fees and variable fees in excess of any minimum once the value is fixed or determinable.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Some of our revenue arrangements combine multiple products and services.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	These products and services may be provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same arrangement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	We allocate fees to the separate deliverables based on the deliverables relative selling price, which is generally based on the price we charge when the same deliverable is sold separately.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	We record taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions (such as sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes) on a net basis; therefore, we exclude such taxes from revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Deferred revenue represents the portion of licenses or subscriptions billed or collected in advance of the service being provided which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Certain arrangements may have cancellation or refund provisions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	If we make a refund, it typically reflects the amount collected from a customer for which we have not yet provided services.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The refund therefore results in a reduction of deferred revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Through December 31, 2013, we paid sales commissions based on a formula driven by the total contract value of sales opportunities closed, with any subsequent adjustments (such as clawbacks for contract cancellations) reflected in future commission payouts.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	We considered the corresponding commission expense an incremental direct acquisition cost and treated it as a deferred charge, which we expensed over the term of the underlying sales contracts.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In the first quarter of 2014, we modified our sales incentive plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The revised plan is based on a combination of net new sales and specific business objectives not solely tied to revenue growth.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	Because of this new structure and the discretion involved in determining the related incentives, we started expensing sales commissions as incurred instead of amortizing them over the contract terms.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	However, we continued to amortize the deferred charge capitalized in connection with sales commissions paid in 2013 and previous periods as part of the previous incentive plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	This amortization added $0.2 million , $0.6 million , and $3.5 million of sales commission cost in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Advertising costs include expenses incurred for various print and Internet ads, search engine fees, and direct mail campaigns.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	We expense advertising costs as incurred.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	The table below summarizes our advertising expense for the past three years:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, market stock units, and stock options.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share awards on the date of grant based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	For market stock units, we estimate the fair value of the awards using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	For stock options, we estimate the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of all employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience as needed.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	In some of our operations, we offer employees a sabbatical leave.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Although the sabbatical policy varies by region, Morningstar's full-time employees are generally eligible for six weeks of paid time off after four years of continuous service.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	We account for our sabbatical liability in accordance with FASB ASC 710-10-25 , Compensated Absences .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	We record a liability for employees' sabbatical benefits over the period employees earn the right for sabbatical leave and include this liability in Accrued Compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	FASB ASC 740 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	In November 2016, we amended our credit agreement to provide us with a three -year credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The credit agreement also provides for issuance of up to $25.0 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The interest rate applicable to any loan under the credit agreement is, at our option, either: (i) the applicable London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00% and 1.75% , based on our consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 2.00% and 2.75% , based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The credit agreement also contains financial covenants under which we: (i) may not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) are required to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	We had an outstanding principal balance of $180.0 million at a one-month LIBOR interest rate plus 100 basis points as of December 31, 2017 , leaving borrowing availability of $120.0 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following table shows how we reconcile our net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The number of weighted average restricted stock units, performance share awards, and market stock units excluded from our calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive was immaterial during the periods presented.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	We report our results in a single reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates our financial results.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Because we have a single reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found directly in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 2 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	We evaluate the performance of our reporting segment based on revenue and operating income.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The tables below summarize our revenue and long-lived assets by geographical area:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	We classify our investments into three categories: available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, and trading.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Our investment portfolio consists of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	We classify our investment portfolio as shown below:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following table shows the cost, unrealized gains (losses), and fair values related to investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , investments with unrealized losses for greater than a 12-month period were not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not deemed to have other than temporary declines in value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	The table below shows the cost and fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity based on their contractual maturities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table shows the realized gains and losses arising from sales of our investments classified as available-for-sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	We determine realized gains and losses using the specific identification method.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following table shows the net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	The table below shows the fair value of our assets subject to fair value measurements that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a fair value hierarchy:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	Based on our analysis of the nature and risks of our investments in equity securities and mutual funds, we have determined that presenting each of these investment categories in the aggregate is appropriate.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	We measure the fair value of money market funds, mutual funds, equity securities, and exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	We did not hold any securities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions in 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	In December 2016, we acquired an additional 78% interest in PitchBook Data, Inc. (PitchBook), increasing our ownership to 100% from 22% .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	PitchBook delivers data, research, and technology covering the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of this acquisition in our Consolidated Financial Statements on December 1, 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	PitchBook contributed $4.1 million of revenue and $7.5 million of operating expense during the one-month period that PitchBook was included in our consolidated results for 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	PitchBook's total estimated fair value of $235.1 million includes $188.2 million in cash paid to acquire the remaining 78% interest in PitchBook as well as a $46.9 million fair value related to our previous 22% ownership interest.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The book value of this ownership immediately prior to the acquisition date was $9.8 million , and we recorded a non-cash holding gain of $37.1 million for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held investment.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	We used the income approach and a discounted cash flow analysis of PitchBook s projected revenue, operating expense, and other amounts to arrive at the estimated fair value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	The gain is classified as "Holding gain upon acquisition of additional ownership of equity-method investments" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Adjustments recorded in the measurement period to the purchase price allocation were not significant.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The following table summarizes our allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Accounts receivable acquired were recorded at gross contractual amounts receivable, which approximates fair value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The allocation includes $60.7 million of acquired intangible assets, as follows:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	We recognized a net deferred tax liability of $12.3 million mainly because the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Goodwill of $192.0 million represents the excess over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired with this acquisition.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	We paid this premium for a number of reasons, including the opportunity to offer comprehensive data coverage across the full life cycle of private market transactions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as if we had completed the PitchBook acquisition as of January 1, 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	This unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	In calculating the pro forma information below, we included an estimate of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired, stock-based compensation expense related to the PitchBook bonus plan (see Note 12 for additional information), and interest expense incurred on the long-term debt.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The 2016 pro forma net income excludes the $37.1 million non-cash holding gain generated in connection with the transaction.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	On March 31, 2016, we acquired RequiSight, LLC, which does business as RightPond, a provider of business intelligence data and analytics on defined contribution and defined benefit plans for financial services firms.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of RightPond in our Consolidated Financial Statements on March 31, 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	On May 31, 2016, we acquired InvestSoft Technology, Inc. (InvestSoft), a provider of fixed-income analytics.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	We began consolidating the financial results of InvestSoft in our Consolidated Financial Statements on May 31, 2016.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	In July 2015, we acquired an additional 28.9% interest in Ibbotson Associates Japan K.K. (IAJ), increasing our ownership to 100% from 71.1% .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	Because we previously owned more than 50% of the company, IAJ's financial results were consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements prior to acquiring the remaining interest.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	In November 2015, we acquired Total Rebalance Expert (tRx), an automated, tax-efficient investment portfolio rebalancing platform for financial advisors.

1289419_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	We began consolidating the financial results of tRx in our Consolidated Financial Statements on November 2, 2015.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	We did not record any impairment losses in 2017 and 2016 as the estimated fair values of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The following table summarizes our intangible assets:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The following table summarizes our amortization expense related to intangible assets:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	We did not record any impairment losses involving intangible assets in 2017 and 2016 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their expected economic useful lives.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	Based on acquisitions and divestitures completed through December 31, 2017 , we expect intangible amortization expense for 2018 and subsequent years to be as follows:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by additional acquisitions, divestitures, changes in the estimated average useful life, and foreign currency translation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	In June 2014, we acquired the remaining 81.3% interest in HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. (HelloWallet), increasing our ownership to 100% .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	This valued HelloWallet at $54.0 million , an amount that included $39.2 million of goodwill and $9.5 million of intangible assets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	On June 30, 2017, we sold HelloWallet to KeyBank National Association, a bank-based financial services company.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	We recorded a noncash gain on the sale of $16.7 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	This gain mainly represents the sale proceeds of $23.7 million less $2.4 million of goodwill and the write-off of the remaining net book value on the acquired intangible assets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P123_S3	As some aspects of HelloWallet had been integrated into Morningstar's single reporting unit, the goodwill attributable to this transaction was calculated using a relative fair value allocation method.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The sale of HelloWallet did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation because the divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts included in the gain on sale of business for the year ended December 31, 2017:

1289419_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	Deferred rent includes build-out and rent abatement allowances received, which are amortized over the remaining portion of the original term of the lease as a reduction in office lease expense.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	We include deferred rent, as appropriate, in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Deferred rent, noncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our shareholders approved the Morningstar 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) on May 17, 2011.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P142_S1	As of that date, we stopped granting awards under the Morningstar 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	The 2004 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Morningstar 2000 Stock Option Plan, and the Morningstar 2001 Stock Option Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	The 2011 Plan provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including, among other things, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share awards, market stock units, and stock options.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	We granted restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock options under the 2004 Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P144_S1	All of our employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P144_S2	Grants awarded under the 2011 Plan or the 2004 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, settled, or otherwise terminated without a distribution of shares, or shares withheld by us in connection with the exercise of options, will be available for awards under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P144_S3	For any shares subject to awards that are withheld by us in connection with the payment of any required income tax withholding, the 2011 Plan provides for the ability to have these shares become available for new awards, but this feature of the 2011 plan has not been implemented.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following table summarizes the number of shares available for future grants under our 2011 Plan:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit we recorded in the past three years:

1289419_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following table summarizes the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2017 and the expected number of months over which the expense will be recognized:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Most of our larger annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	We adjust the stock-based compensation expense annually in the third quarter to reflect those awards that ultimately vested and update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	Restricted stock units represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P151_S1	Restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over a four -year period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P151_S2	Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity during the past three years:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	In March 2015 and 2016, executive officers, other than Joe Mansueto, and certain other employees, were granted performance share awards.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P154_S1	These awards entitle the holder to a number of shares of Morningstar common stock equal to the number of notional performance shares that become vested.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P154_S2	Each award specifies a number of performance shares that will vest if pre-established target performance goals are attained.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P154_S3	The number of performance shares that actually vest may be more or less than the specified number of performance shares to the extent Morningstar exceeds or fails to achieve, respectively, the target performance goals over a three -year performance period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	We base the grant date fair value for these awards on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to the grant date.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the satisfaction of the performance condition that is most likely to be satisfied over the three -year performance period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	The table below shows target performance share awards granted and shares that would be issued at current performance levels for performance share awards granted as of December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	Market Stock Units In May and November 2017, executive officers, other than Joe Mansueto, and certain other employees, were granted market stock units.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	These market stock units represent the right to receive a target number of shares that will vest at the end of a three-year performance period depending on the company s total shareholder return over that three-year period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	We measure the fair value of our market stock units on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of our market stock units during 2017:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	The table below shows market stock units granted and target market stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	In connection with our acquisition of PitchBook, we adopted a management bonus sub-plan under the 2011 Plan for certain employees of PitchBook (the PitchBook Plan).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the PitchBook Plan, awards having an aggregate target value equal to $30.0 million will be available for issuance with annual grants of $7.5 million for 2017, $7.5 million in 2018, and $15.0 million in 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	Each grant will consist of performance-based share unit awards which will vest over a one -year period and will be measured primarily based on the achievement of certain annual revenue targets specifically related to PitchBook s business.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	Upon achievement of these targets, earned performance units will be settled in shares of our common stock on a one -for-one basis.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P162_S2	If PitchBook exceeds certain performance conditions, the PitchBook Plan participants may receive payment for performance units in excess of the aggregate target values described above.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P162_S3	If PitchBook fails to meet threshold performance conditions, the PitchBook Plan participants will not be entitled to receive payment for any performance units.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P162_S4	In certain circumstances, the PitchBook Plan participants may be able to receive a catch-up award with respect to 2017 or 2018 if certain additional performance conditions are met in a subsequent year.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	The table below shows target performance share awards granted and shares that will be issued based on final performance levels for performance share awards granted as of December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	Stock options granted to employees vest ratably over a four -year period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	Grants to our non-employee directors vest ratably over a three -year period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P164_S2	All grants expire 10 years after the date of grant.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	In May 2011, we granted 86,106 stock options under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P165_S1	In November 2011, we granted 6,095 stock options under the 2011 Plan.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P165_S2	All options granted in 2011 have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P165_S3	We estimated the fair value of the options on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity in the past three years for our various stock option grants:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	The following table summarizes the total intrinsic value (difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option) of options exercised:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	The table below shows additional information for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2017 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value all option holders would have received if they had exercised all outstanding options on December 31, 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P169_S1	The intrinsic value is based on our closing stock price of $96.97 on December 29, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P170_S0	We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our U.S.-based employees to voluntarily contribute pre-tax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P170_S1	In 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in the United States in an amount equal to 75 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 7% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following table summarizes our matching contributions:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following table shows our income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 :
1289419_18_ITEM8_P173_S0	On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform Act").
1289419_18_ITEM8_P173_S1	The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, changing to a territorial tax system and imposing a transitional tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P173_S2	The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P174_S0	On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	We have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the changes under the Tax Reform Act and have included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P174_S2	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions that we may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P174_S3	The accounting is expected to be complete when our 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P175_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P175_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P175_S3	As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $14.7 million tax benefit in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	With respect to the transitional tax related to the change to a territorial system, the Tax Reform Act provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ("E P") through the year ended December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	We had an estimated $183.7 million of undistributed foreign E P subject to the deemed mandatory repatriation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P176_S2	After the utilization of corresponding tax credits, we have recorded a provisional tax charge of $7.5 million on the deemed mandatory repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries payable over 8 years.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P176_S3	We have also recorded a provisional reduction of a deferred tax liability of $6.4 million previously recorded for our foreign equity method investments.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P176_S4	The transitional tax charge of $7.5 million offset by the reduction of the $6.4 million deferred tax liability results in a net tax expense of $1.1 million on the deemed mandatory repatriation of earnings of our foreign affiliates.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	We are continuing to assess our indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	We have recorded a provisional estimate of deferred taxes in the amount of $3.0 million for foreign withholding taxes that would be due upon remittance of dividends from certain of our foreign affiliates.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S2	We are still evaluating whether to change our overall indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Tax Reform Act and consider our conclusion to be incomplete under SAB 118.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S3	Accordingly, we consider that most of our remaining foreign outside basis differences to be indefinitely reinvested.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S4	Accordingly, we have not recorded deferred taxes on those outside basis differences.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S5	As part of our continuing evaluation, we will need to gather additional information to compute outside basis differences for our foreign affiliates in order to assess whether any new deferred taxes should be recorded.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S6	We will also need to account for any prospective interpretive guidance issued on the Tax Reform Act as part of our evaluation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P177_S7	If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period allowed under SAB 118, we will account for a change in assertion as part of our accounting for the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Tax Reform Act also establishes other provisions that may affect our 2018 results, including but not limited to, the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT); a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low-Tax Income, or "GILTI"); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminate the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P179_S1	We are still evaluating the BEAT provisions which are applicable after December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	While the Tax Reform Act generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by certain subsidiaries may be included in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules (as a result of U.S. expense allocation rules).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P180_S1	Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Reform Act and the application of U.S. GAAP.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P180_S2	Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy election and either treat taxes due from GILTI as a current-period expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P180_S3	Our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI rules will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI, and if so, what the impact is expected to be.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P180_S4	We have not yet computed a reasonable estimate of the effect of this provision, and therefore, we have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes related to GILTI nor have we made any adjustments related to GILTI tax in our year-end financial statements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following table reconciles our income tax expense at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income tax expense as recorded:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	The following table provides our income before income taxes and equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, generated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	We recognize deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and their tax basis.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P184_S1	The tax effects of the temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	The deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following table summarizes our U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P187_S0	The net decrease in the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 primarily reflects the utilization of U.S. federal NOLs.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P187_S1	We have not recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. federal NOLs of $9.1 million because we expect the benefit of the U.S. federal NOLs to be fully utilized before expiration.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P188_S0	The following table summarizes our NOL carryforwards for our non-U.S. operations:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	The change in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 primarily reflects the use of NOL carryforwards offset by NOLs generated.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P190_S1	We have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately $5.4 million of the non-U.S. NOLs, reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of these NOLs will not be realized.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	We conduct business globally and as a result, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P191_S1	In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P191_S2	The open tax years for our U.S. Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2008 to the present.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	We are currently under audit by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	It is likely that the examination phase of some of these U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2018 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $8.7 million and a non-current liability of $7.0 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P194_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $8.9 million and a non-current liability of $5.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P194_S2	These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	The table below reconciles the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as follows:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	In 2017 , we recorded a net increase of $2.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits before settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $2.9 million increased our income tax expense by $3.1 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P196_S1	In addition, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $2.6 million for settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, of which $2.6 million decreased our income tax expense by $2.2 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $18.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $15.0 million , if recognized, would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by $14.4 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our income tax expense.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P198_S1	The following table summarizes our gross liability for interest and penalties:
1289419_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	We recorded the increase in the liabilities for penalties and interest, net of any tax benefits, to income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	In August 2017, Michael D. Green, individually and purportedly on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P200_S1	The complaint names as defendants Morningstar, Inc., Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co., and contains one count alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	Plaintiff, a participant in a pension plan, alleges that the defendants engaged in concerted racketeering actions to steer plan participants into high-cost investments that pay unwarranted fees to the defendants.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P201_S1	The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages for plaintiff and the members of the putative class, treble damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys fees.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P201_S2	Morningstar has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which is fully briefed and under advisement by the court.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	Although Morningstar is vigorously contesting the claim asserted, we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	Other Matters We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and litigation that arise in the normal course of our business.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	We had an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our board of directors in September 2010 and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P204_S1	The authorization expired on December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had repurchased a total of 10,574,857 shares for $714.8 million under this authorization, leaving no shares available for future repurchases as the plan expired on December 31, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	On December 8, 2017, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P205_S2	The authorization expires on December 31, 2020.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	We may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P207_S1	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P207_S2	The original effective date for ASU No. 2014-09 would have required us to adopt it beginning on January 1, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P207_S3	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P207_S4	We elected the deferral, and the new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	We have obtained an understanding of ASU No. 2014-09 and have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of the new standard on our financial results.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	We have completed a high-level assessment of the attributes within our contracts for our major products and services, and we have assessed the impacts to our internal processes, control environment, and disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P208_S2	We have determined that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will not result in a material change to the timing of when revenue is recognized and we intend to retain similar accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under current practices.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P208_S3	We have identified that there will be certain changes in accounting treatment related to delivery of third-party content (principal vs. agent) and costs to obtain contracts (e.g., sales commissions).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	The change related to delivery of third-party content (principal vs. agent) is expected to result in no impact on our consolidated operating income; however it will result in a increase in both revenue and cost of revenue versus prior periods of approximately $6 million to $7 million as revenue will be recognized on a gross rather than net basis for certain arrangements.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The change related to the capitalization of cost to obtain contracts is expected to result in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $25 million to $30 million for commission expenses which were previously expensed.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	We expected to amortize this adjustment over a period not to exceed three years and expect 2018 commission expense resulting from this change will range between $14 million and $16 million .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	Additionally, in 2018 we will expense any discretionary payments made under our commission plans as well as pro-rata portions of any new commission amounts paid in 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	We plan to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P211_S2	Upon adoption, we will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as noted above.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P211_S3	Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted and we will discuss the comparability of these adjustments within our 2018 results against the prior periods.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	We are continuing to evaluate the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statement presentation and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	We expect expanded disclosures related to the revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability (i.e., deferred revenue) balance at the beginning of the period.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	We also plan to provide additional disclosures on our unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period and expected timing of when that contract liability will be recognized into revenue.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which provides guidance on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	On May 6, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC guidance because of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2014-16 pursuant to staff announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , which rescinds the following SEC Staff Observer comments from ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , upon an entity's early adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : Revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including a reseller of the vendor's products).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P213_S3	On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09 and provides practical expedients to simplify the transition to the new standard and clarify certain aspects of the standard.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P213_S4	On December 21, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which makes narrow-scope amendments to ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	The effective date and transition requirements for ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11, ASU No. 2016-12, and ASU No. 2016-20 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P215_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P215_S3	Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which reduces diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P217_S1	The new guidance clarifies the classification of cash activities related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity-method investments, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P217_S2	The guidance also describes a predominance principle in which cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P218_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P218_S2	The new standard must be adopted using a retrospective transition method.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which revises the definition of a business.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P221_S1	To be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P221_S2	The new guidance provides a framework to evaluate when an input and substantive process are present (including for early-stage companies that have not generated outputs).
1289419_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	To be a business without outputs, there will now need to be an organized workforce.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P222_S1	The new guidance also narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
1289419_18_ITEM8_P222_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P222_S3	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S1	The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S2	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S3	All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S4	Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S5	The same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S6	Entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S7	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S8	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P223_S9	Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P224_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-04 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	On May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting , which clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P225_S1	Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P225_S2	The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P225_S3	The new standard should be applied prospectively.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P225_S4	We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2017-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	(1) Non-operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $37.1 million holding gain related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in PitchBook, which was previously a minority investment.
1289419_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	(2) Non-operating income in the second quarter of 2017 included a $17.5 million gain on the sale of HelloWallet.

1289419_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	(3) Tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a net benefit of $10.6 million related to the impact of the Tax Reform Act.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We design disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, participated in and supervised this evaluation.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act meets the requirements listed above.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 .
1289419_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and incorporated herein by reference.
