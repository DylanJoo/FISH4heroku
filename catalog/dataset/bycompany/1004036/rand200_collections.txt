1004036_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , we owned and operated 31 outlet centers, with a t otal gross leasable area of approximately 9.2 million square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	These outlet centers were 98% occupied and contained over 2,000 stores, representing approximately 360 store brands.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P0_S4	We also operated and had partial ownership interests in two outlet centers totaling approximately 948,000 square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	The outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Tanger GP Trust and the Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	The Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership int erest.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	The Tanger family, through its ownership of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, holds the remaining units as a limited partner.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company, was the sole general partner of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership from its inception until August 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	For further discussion, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed under Item 15 to this Form 10-K.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company, through its ownership of the Tanger GP and Tanger LP Trusts, owned 20,249,017 units of the Operating Partnership and the Tanger Family Limited Partnership owned the remaining 3,033,305 u nits.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Tanger Family Limited Partnership unit is exchangeable for four of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of our common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also operate in a manner intended to enable us to preserve our status as a REIT, including, among other things, making distributions with respect to our outstanding common shares equal to at least 90% of our taxable income each year.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Company is a North Carolina corporation and the Operating Partnership is a North Carolina partnership, which were formed in 1993.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our executive offices are currently located at 3200 Northline Avenue, Suite 360, Greensboro, North Carolina, 27408 and our telephone number is (336) 292-3010.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our website can be accessed at www.tangeroutlet.com.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	A copy of our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks and any amendments thereto can be obtained, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this annual report on Form 10-K or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	In November 2010, we opened our newest Tanger outlet center in Mebane, North Carolina 100% occupied.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The new center contains approximately 319,000 square foot and approximately 80 outlet tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	The total cost for the center was approximately $64.9 million and was funded by operating cash flows and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	During 2010, we began execution of a redevelopment plan for our Hilton Head I, South Carolina center.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The plan included a complete demolition of the existing 162,000 square foot center originally acquired in 2003.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The center, which is scheduled to re-open the first weekend of April 2011, will contain approximately 176,000 square feet as well as four outparcel pads.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	The total incremental cost for the redeveloped center is expected to be approximately $43.0 million and will be funded by operating cash flows and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for three potential new development sites located in League City (Houston), Texas; Scottsdale, Arizona and West Phoenix, Arizona.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	There can be no assurance that these sites will ultimately be developed.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	We expect that these projects, if realized, would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	We may also consider the use of additional operational or developmental joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In January 2 011, we announced that we entered into a letter of intent with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to form an exclusive joint venture for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Any projects developed will be co-owned on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	It is the intention of the joint venture to develop as many as 10 to 15 outlet centers in larger urban markets and tourist areas across Canada, over a five to seven year period.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	The typical size of a Tanger Outlet Center is approximately 350,000 square feet dependent on the individual market and tenant demand.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Assuming these parameters are suitable and materialize in Canada, the overall investment of the joint ven ture is anticipated to be as high as $1 billion, on a fully built out basis,.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	There can be no assurance that the joint venture will be consummated, or even if the joint venture is consummated that the current plans of the joint venture will be realized.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	In June 2010, the Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $300.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes").
1004036_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	The 2020 Notes pay interest semi-annually and were priced at 99.310% of the principal amount to yield 6.219% to maturity.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Notes to (i) repay our $235 million unsecured term loan due in June 2011, (ii) pay approximately $6.1 million to terminate two interest rate swap agreements associated with the term loan, (iii) repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and (iv) for general working capital purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	In November 2010, the Operating Partnership entered into a $385.0 million syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit (the "Syndicated Line").
1004036_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition to the Syndicated Line, the Operating Partnership simultaneously entered into a $15.0 million cash management line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Cash Management Line"), providing total revolving line capacity of $400.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Cash Management Line's terms are substantially the same as the Syndicated Line, including maturity date.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Syndicated Line replaces our previous $325.0 million in bilateral lines of credit that were scheduled to mature between June and August 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Syndicated Line, together with the Cash Management Line, represents an increase in line capacity of more than 20%.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	Through an accordion feature, the maximum borrowing capacity on the Syndicated Line may be increased to up to $500.0 million under certain circumstances.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	The maturity date of the new lines is November 29, 2013, and we have an option to extend the lines for one year.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P16_S4	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a spread over LIBOR of 1.90% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.40% on the total committed amount.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	The initial redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	In October 2010, Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company and member of the Board of Directors, passed away.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Mr. Tanger ceded the role of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer in 2009, but remained a Director of the Company until his passing.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	His legacy lives on and is carried forward by everyone at Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	In August 2010, Thomas E. McDonough joined our management team as Executive Vice-President of Operations.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Mr. McDonough brings nearly 30 years of REIT management, leasing, acquisition and development experience to the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	In September 2010, Thomas R. Reddin was added as a member of the Company's Board of Directors and the Operating Partnership's Board of Trustees.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Mr. Reddin brings over 30 years of consumer marketing and e-commerce experience to the Board.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	In January 2011, Kevin M. Dillon, Senior Vice Presiden t - Construction and Development, announced his resignation effective in April 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Mr. Dillon served in different construction and development related capacities for over 17 years with the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Outlets are manufacturer-operated retail stores that sell primarily first quality, branded products at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Outlet centers offer numerous advantages to both consumers and manufacturers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Manufacturers selling in outlet stores are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, which enhance the manufacturer's profit potential.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Outlet centers enable manufacturers to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, outlet centers benefit manufacturers by permitting them to sell out-of-season, overstocked or discontinued merchandise without alienating department stores or hampering the manufacturer's brand name, as is often the case when merchandise is distributed via discount chains.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide as high of an initial return on investment as has been historically achieved.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Each of our outlet centers carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that national manufacturers and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have developed long-sta nding relationships with many national and regional manufacturers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Because of our established relationships, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,475 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of February 1, 2011, we had a diverse tenant base comprised of approximately 360 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue - Off Fifth, Calvin Klein, Ann Taylor, GAP, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Juicy, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand Jeans, Reebok, Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie Fitch, Eddie Bauer, Coach Leatherware, Brooks Brothers, BCBG, Michael Kors, Nike and others.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Most of the outlet stores are directly operated by the respective manufacturer.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	No single tenant (includin g affiliates) accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	As of December 31 2010, no single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for more than 8.4% of our leasable square feet or 6.6% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	Because our typical tenant is a large, national manufacturer, we generally do not experience any material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 90% of our total revenues in 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues in 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center busi ness in 1981.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	In June 1993, we completed our i nitial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the country.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	We part ner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with approximately 360 brand name manufacturers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Nothing takes the place of experience.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 30 years.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage and a history of accomplishments in the manufacturers' outlet business.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are proud to report that as of December 31, 2010, our wholly- owned outlet centers were 98% occupied with average tenant sales of $354 per square foot.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development and operation of manufacturers' outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Growth does not happen by chance.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing centers, renovating and expanding our mature centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of new outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our leasing team implements an ongoing strategy designed to positively impact our bottom line.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	This is accomplished through the aggressive marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	As we search across North America looking for new markets, we do our homework and determine site viability on a timely and cost-effective basis.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our 30 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	We expect development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	We follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive a t least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Historically, we required that at least 50% of the space in each center is pre-leased prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	This pre-leasing policy is consistent with our conservative financing perspective and the discipline we impose upon ourselves.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Co nstruction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to the opening of the first tenant stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Keeping our shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a remerchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketi ng expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary le asing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	The long-standing retailer relationships that we enjoy allow us the ability to provide our sho ppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	In order for our centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, website, internet advertising, social networks, smart phone applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the message that Tanger is the place to shop for the best brands and the biggest outlet savings - direct from the manufacturer .
1004036_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P54_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence our debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by s trategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcel s on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis , distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2013 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new center.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls and full- and off-price retailers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	Traditional full- and off-price retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet cente rs be located not less than 10 miles from the nearest major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	For this reason, our centers compete only to a very limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	We compete directly with one large national owner of outlet centers and numerous small owners, however, there is the potential for increased competition from other developers who have announced plans to enter the outlet industry.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	We believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier brand name manufacturers, have minimized the number of new outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina in which our corporate headquarters is located.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition, we rent a regional office in New York City, New York under a lease agreement and sublease agreement to better service our principal fashion-related tenants, many of whom are based in and around that area.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	We mainta in offices and employ on-site managers at 32 centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Op erating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease agreement with us.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	As of February 1, 2011, we had 197 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in New York and 32 business offices.
1004036_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	At that date, we also employed 235 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing ou tlet centers successfully.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to vary ing degrees of risk.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We intend to grow our business through acquisitions and developments.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers may increase in the future, which would increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space o n economically favorable terms.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant sp ace for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Such bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders interests.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We own partial interests in and manage two outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We perform the property management and leasing services for these properties and receive fees for these services.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As property manager of the joint ventures that own the properties, we have certain fiduciary responsibilities to the other members in those joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The approval or consent of the other members is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of such properties.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions by the managing member that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans with respect to expansion, development, financing or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of war and earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Historically high fuel prices may impact consumer travel and spending habits.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Most shoppers use private automobile transportation to travel to our outlet centers and many of our centers are not easily accessible by public transportation.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Increasing fuel costs may reduce the number of trips to our centers thus reducing the amount spent at our centers.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Many of our outlet center locations near tourist destinations may experience an even more acute reduction of shoppers if there were a reduction of people opting to drive to vacation destinatio ns.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Such reductions in traffic could adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Increasing fuel costs may also reduce disposable income and decrease demand for retail products.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Such a decrease could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay o r refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securitie s.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90.0% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the R EIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnershi p will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2011, our wholly-owned portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers totaling 9.2 million square feet located in 21 states.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We operate and own interests in two other centers totaling approximately 948,000 square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,475 square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our Riverhead, New York center is the only property that represented more than 10% of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	No property represented more than 10% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	See Properties - Significant Property for further details.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring centers, developing new centers and expanding existing centers.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources o f financing thereof.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of the 31 outlet centers in our wholly-owned portfolio, we own the land underlying 27 and have ground leases on four.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the four centers are located:
1004036_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S0	The initial term of our typical tenant lease averages approximately five years.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S1	Generally, leases provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S2	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S3	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S4	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable center.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P5_S5	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our wholly-owned outlet centers as of February 1, 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P8_S1	(2) Includes a 29,253 square foot warehouse adjacent to the property utilized to support the operations of the retail tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM2_P9_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2011, scheduled lease expirations for our wholly-owned outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options.

1004036_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had 31 wholly-owned centers in 21 states totaling 9.2 million square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The table below sets forth the changes in the number of centers, square feet and states:
1004036_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $ 4.9 million , or 3%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rents from 2009 to 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant space.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	In November 2010, we opened our new outlet center in Mebane, North Carolina and during the second quarter of 2009 opened an additional expansion phase at our Commerce II, Georgia outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, we completed the demolition of approximately 162,000 square feet at our center in Hilton Head, South Carolina.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The redevelopment of this site began during the second quarter of 2010 with the opening of a new 176,000 square foot outlet center expected in the second quarter of 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Also, included in base rentals is the amortization from the value of the above and below market leases recorded as a result of our property acquisitions as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	At December 31, 2010 , the net liability representing the amount of unrecognized combined above and below market lease values totaled approximately $1.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	PERCENTAGE RENTALS Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels (the "breakpoint"), increased $1.1 million, or 16% from the 2009 period to the 2010 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in percentage rentals are directly related to the strength of our tenants' sales.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our wholly owned properties for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 6.6% to $354 per square foot.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $2.1 million , or 3%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements from 2009 to 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimb ursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	OTHER INCOME Other income decreased $2.5 million, or 22%, in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period due primarily to the $3.3 million gain on the sale of a land outparcel at our Washington, PA center in August 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	This decrease was partially offset by the incremental other income generated from the opening of the center in Mebane, NC in November 2010 and an increase in Tanger Club memberships and other vending categories.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $5.2 million, or 6%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The follow ing table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses from 2009 to 2010 thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase in existing property operating expenses is primarily due to increases in snow removal in 2010 due to extreme winter weather in December in the eastern portion of the United States and normal annual increases associated with operating mall offices throughout our portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses decreased $8.0 million, or 25%, in th e 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Effective September 1, 2009, Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company, retired as an employee of the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	His severance, totaling $10.3 million, consisted of a cash payment of $3.4 million and $6.9 million of share-based compensation from the accelerated vesting of restricted common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Excluding this severance, general and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million primarily as a result of additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2010 notional unit plan and increases in other professional and legal fees.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.9 million, or 2%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The majority of the decrease is due to lower levels of intangible lease cost amortization from acquired outlet centers in 2003, 2005 and 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	These decreases were partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.0 million and $6.3 million recognized during the 2010 and 2009 period s, respectively, related to the demolition and redevelopment plan at our Hilton Head I, SC center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	IMPAIRMENT CHARGE In 2005 we sold our outlet center located in Seymour, Indiana, but retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we had sold in recent years.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land in Seymour, IN.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land for sale, we accounted for the land as "held for sale" and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in our consolidated statements of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its fair value at that time.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	We determined the estimated fair value using a market approach considering offers that we had obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $3.6 million, or 9%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	This decrease was due to the significant reduction in the average amount of debt outstanding through an exchange offering in May 2009 and a common share offering in August 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	These two equity transactions in essence retired approximately $259.1 million of outstanding debt.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The 2010 period includes the write-off of approximately $563,000 of unamortized loan origination costs.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	These assets were written-off due to the repayment of the $235.0 million term loan facility in the 2010 period with a portion of the proceeds from the 2020 Notes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	In May 2009, senior exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership in the principal amount of $142.3 million and a carrying amount of $135.3 million were exchanged for common shares of the Company, representing approximately 95.2% of the total senior exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of approximately 9.7 million common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	Following settlement of the exchange offer, senior exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million remained outstanding.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	In connection with the exchange offering, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	LOSS ON TERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES During the second quarter of 2010, we terminated two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $235.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	These agreements were originally entered into in 2008 for the purpose of fixing the LIBOR based interest rate on the $235.0 million term loan facility originally completed in June 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	We paid approximately $6.1 million to terminate the two interest rate swap agreements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The agreements were terminated because the underlying debt for the derivative transaction was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the 2020 Notes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Prior to when they were terminated, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Unrealized gains and losses related to the effective portion of the swaps were recognized in other comprehensive income.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Because the swaps were highly effective, the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income when the swaps were terminated was equal to the amount recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The contemporaneous termination of the swaps and the related debt caused the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassified to earnings.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Additionally, a payment of $6.1 million, which was considered to be an investing activity in the statement of cash flows, was made to relieve the obligation that was recorded as a liability.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	GAIN ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN ACQUIRED JOINT VENTURE On January 5, 2009, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture for a cash price of $32.0 million and the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of $35.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The acquisition was funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	We had owned a 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture since its formation in 2001 and accounted for it under the equity method.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	The joint venture is now 100% owned by us and has been consolidated since January 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	The acquis ition was accounted for under the new guidance for acquisitions which was effective January 1, 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	Under this guidance, we recorded a gain of $31.5 million which represented the difference between the fair market value of our previously owned interest and its cost basis.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by $1.0 million, or 69%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The improvement is due to the natural expiration of $170.0 million of interest rate swaps at the Deer Park joint venture in June 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The expiration of these swaps enabled the joint venture to incur interest at a variable rate based on a LIBOR index that is currently at historically low levels.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The increase was offset slightly by higher interest rate levels at our Wisconsin Dells joint venture which refinanced its $24.8 million mortgage loan in December 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	The new mortgage included a credit spread over the LIBOR rate of 3.00% compared to a credit spread of 1.30% in the expiring mortgage.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In May 2010, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan for our management to sell our Commerce I, Geo rgia center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The facts and circumstances of the plan met the accounting requirements to classify the results of operations of the center as discontinued operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The majority of the center was sold in July 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	The remaining portion of the center was sold during the first quarter of 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the remaining portion of the center to its approximate fair value based on the actual sales contracts related to the center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	In the 2009 period, we recorded an impairment charge for the Commerce I, GA property of $5.2 million which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its estimated fair value at that time.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $16.3 million, or 10%, in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rents from 2008 to 2009 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	In August 2008 we opened our new outlet center in Washington, Pennsylvania and during the second quarter of 2009 opened an additional expansion phase at our outlet center in Commerce, Georgia.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	In January 2009 we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture that held the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17, South Carolina center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 outlet center is now wholly-owned and has been consolidated in our 2009 period results.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant space.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The above increases were partially offset by a reduction at existing centers in the recognition of termination fees in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The 2009 period included approximately $1.0 million of termination fees compared to $1.5 million in the 2008 period due to fewer tenants terminating leases early.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Also, included in base rentals is the amortization from the value of the above and below market leases recorded as a result of our property acquisitions as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	The net amortization of above and below market leases, excluding the newly acquired Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 property, for the 2009 period was an increase to base rentals of approximately $70,000.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	This represents a decrease of approximately $286,000, or 80%, over the 2008 period amount of approximately $356,000.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	The decrease is due to the aging acquired leases that exist in our portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	At December 31, 2009, the net liability representing the amount of unrecognized combined above and below market lease values totaled approximately $2.4 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	PERCENTAGE RENTALS Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volu me above predetermined levels (the "breakpoint"), decreased $257,000, or 4% from the 2008 period to the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in percentage rentals from 2008 to 2009 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The decrease in percentage rentals are directly related to the strength of our tenants' sales.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Tenant sales were negatively impacted by the general weakness in the US economy.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, a significant number of tenants that renewed t heir leases renewed at much higher base rental rates and, accordingly, had increases to their contractual breakpoint levels used in determining their percentage rentals.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	This essentially transformed a variable rent component into a fixed rent component.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $6.8 million, or 9%, in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements from 2008 to 2009 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase is due primarily to the $6.3 million of incremental reimbursed expenses from our new Washington, PA outlet center and the now w holly-owned Myrtle Beach Hwy 17, SC outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	OTHER INCOME Other income increased $4.0 million, or 56%, in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period due primarily to the a $3.3 million gain on the sale of a land outparcel at our Washington, PA center in August 2009 and approximately $473,000 in incremental ot her vending income associated with the incremental addition of the Washington, PA and Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 centers as described above.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The remainder of the increase related to management fees earned from services provided to the Deer Park joint venture which opened in October 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	This increase in fees was partially offset by a decrease in fees from services provided to the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture which became wholly-owned in January 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $6.8 million, or 8%, in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses from 2008 to 2009 (in th ousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase is due primarily to the $6.3 million of incremental operating costs from our new Washington, PA outlet center, the expansion at our Commerce II, GA outlet center and the now wholly-owned Myrtle Beach Hwy 17, SC outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The land that the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 property was constructed on is subject to a land lease of approximately $1.1 million per year.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increases in operating expenses at our existing centers related to various common area maintenance projects and increased snow removal costs.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses increased $10.3 million, or 46%, in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Effective September 1, 2009, Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company, retired as an employee of the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	His severance, totaling $10.3 million, consisted of a cash payment of $3 .4 million and $6.9 million of share-based compensation from the accelerated vesting of restricted common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	The cash payment was made during the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES Depreciation and amortization increased $18.5 million, or 30%, in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 per iod.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	During the first quarter of 2009, we obtained approval from Beaufort County, South Carolina to implement a redevelopment plan at the Hilton Head I, SC outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Based on our redevelopment timeline, we intended to demolish the existing buildings by the end of the second quarter of 2010 and therefore changed the estimated useful life to end at that time.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result of this change in useful life, additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $6.3 million was recognized during the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	The accelerated depreciation and amortization reduced income from continuing operations and net income by approximately $.08 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	Of the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization, $11.4 million is due to the addition of the Washington, PA and Myrtle Beach Hwy 17, SC centers to the wholly-owned portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $3.4 million, or 8%, in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The decrease is primarily related to the extinguishment of a principal amount of $142.3 million of exchangeable notes through the issuance of equity described below and the issuance of 6.9 million common shares in August 2009, the proceeds of which were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Also, a significant portion of our outstanding debt is comprised of unsecured lines of credit which incur interest based on the LIBOR index plus a credit spread.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The 2009 period saw unprecedented low LIBOR index levels which reduced the overall borrowing rate associated with o ur lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	In May 2009, exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership in the principal amount of $142.3 million and a carrying amount of $135.3 million were exchanged for common shares of the Company, representing appr oximately 95.2% of the total exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of approximately 9.7 million common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Following settlement of the exchange offer, exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million, with a carrying amount of $7.0 million, remained outstanding.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	In connection with the exchange offering, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	LOSS ON TERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES During the second quarter of 2008, we settled two interest rate lock protection agreements which were intended to fix the U.S. Treasury index at an average rate of 4.62% for 10 years for an aggregate $200 million of new public debt which was expected to be issued in July 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	We originally entered into these agreements in 2005.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Upon the closing of the LIBOR based unsecured term loan facility, we determined that we were unlikely to execute such a U.S. Treasury based debt offering.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	The settlement of the interest rate lock protection agreements, at a total cost of $8.9 million, was reflected as a loss on settlement of U.S. treasury rate locks in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	GAIN ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN ACQUIRED JOINT VENTURE On January 5, 2009, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture for a cash price of $32.0 million and the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of $35.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The acquisition was funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	We had owned a 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture since its formation in 2001 and accounted for it under the equity method.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P49_S3	The joint venture is now 100% owned by us and has been consolidated since January 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P49_S4	The acquisition was accounted for under the new guidance for acquisitions which was effective January 1, 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	he difference between the fair market value of our previously owned interest and its cost basis.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $2.4 million in the 2009 period compared to the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The 2009 period does not include any equity in earnings from the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture as we acquired the remaining 50% interest in January 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	The acquisition resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.4 million in equity in earnings.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	In addition our equity in the losses incurred by the Deer Pa rk property, decreased in 2009 by approximately $700,000 due to depreciation charges and leverage on the project which was open for a full year in the 2009 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS During the second quarter 2009, we determined for our Commerce I, GA outlet center that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of that property did not exceed the property's carrying value based on deteriorating amounts of net operating income and the expectation that the occupancy rate of the property will significantly decrease in future periods.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Therefore, we recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value at that time.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We determined the fair value using a market approach whereby we considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	There were no such charges during the 2008 period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring cert ain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The Company itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	y may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which was updated in July 2009 that allows the Company to register unspecified various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified and various classes of debt securities.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment comm itments under such guarantees.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Part nership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Based on our 2010 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $39.6 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	We distributed approximately $68.1 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	If events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced, we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our REIT status.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Compa ny does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and t he Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's and the Company's debt and equity offerings.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence our debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Rental and occupancy rates are the primary factors that influence property rental income levels.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in the 2010 period compared to the 20 09 period due to changes in other assets, escrow accounts and accrued liabilities, including the cash payment of $3.4 million to Stanley K. Tanger in 2010 associated with his retirement from the Company in 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Cash flow used in investing activities was higher in 2010 due primarily from a cash payment of $6.1 million to terminate two interest rate swap agreements associated with the underlying debt obligation which was repaid in June 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	In addition, the construction of our Mebane, NC outlet center which opened in November 2010 and our on-going redevelopment project at our center in Hilton Head, South Carolina accounted for higher levels of additions to rental property.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	There were no significant renovation or construction projects during 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	However, 2009 includes the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture that held the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17, South Carolina center at a cash purchase price of $32.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following is a summary of the 2010 and 2009 financing transactions:
1004036_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	In November 2010, the Operating Partnership entered into a total of $400.0 million of syndicated unsecured revolving lines of credit with an initial maturity date of November 20 13.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	In May 2009, in a non-cash transaction, we retired $142.3 million of exchangeable notes through the issuance of 9.7 million common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Throughout 2009, we reduced our amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit from $161.5 million to $57.7 million from cash flow from operations and the August 2009 share issuance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P79_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	In November 2010, we opened our newest Tanger outlet center in Mebane, North Carolina 100% occupied.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The new center contains approximately 319,000 square foot and approximately 80 outlet tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	The total cost for the center was approximately $64.9 million and was funded by operating cash flows and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	During 2010, w e began execution of a redevelopment plan for our Hilton Head I, South Carolina center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	The plan included a complete demolition of the existing 162,000 square foot center originally acquired in 2003.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	The center, which is scheduled to re-open the first weekend of April 2011, will contain approximately 176,000 square feet as well as four outparcel pads.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P81_S3	The total incremental cost for the redeveloped center is expected to be approximately $43.0 million and will be funded by operating cash flows and amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	In April 2010, we terminated our option contract for a new development site in Irving, Texas.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	As the development was deemed no longer probable, we wrote-off approximately $365,000 of predevelopment and due diligence costs associated with the project in the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for three potential new development sites located in League City (Houston), Texas, Scottsdale, Arizona and West Phoenix, Arizona.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	There can be no assurance that these sites will ultimately be developed.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	We expect that these projects, if realized, would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unse cured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital such as collateralized construction loans, public debt or equity offerings.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	We may also consider the use of additional operational or developmental joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	In January 2011, we announced that we entered into a letter of intent with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to form an exclusive joint venture for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Any projects developed will be co-owned on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	It is the intention of the joint venture to develop as many as 10 to 15 outlet centers in larger urban markets and tourist areas across Canada, over a five to seven year period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The typical size of a Tanger Outlet Center is approximately 350,000 square feet dependent on the individual market and tenant demand.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Assuming these parameters are suitable and materialize in Canada, the overall investment of the joint venture is anticipated to be as high as $1 billion, on a fully built out basis,.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	There can be no assurance that the joint venture will be consummated, or even if the joint venture is consummated that the current plans of the joint venture will be realized.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , 100% of our outstanding debt represented unsecured borrowings and 100% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $400.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	All unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of November 29, 2013 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	2010 TRANSACTIONS $300.0 Million Unsecured Bond Issuance In June 2010, the Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $300.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2020.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The 2020 Notes pay interest semi-annually and were priced at 99.310% of the principal amount to yield 6.219%.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Notes to (i) repay our $235 million unsecured term loan due in June 2011, (ii) pay approximately $6.1 million to terminate two interest rate swap agreements associated with the term loan, (iii) repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and (iv) for general working capital purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	In November 2010, the Operating Partnership entered into a $385.0 million syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit (the "Syndicated Line").
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition to the Syndicated Line, the Operating Partnership simultaneously e ntered into a $15.0 million cash management line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Cash Management Line"), providing total revolving line capacity of $400.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	The Cash Management Line's terms are substantially the same as the Syndicated Line, including maturity date.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Syndicated Line replaces our previous $325.0 million in bilateral lines of credit that were scheduled to mature between June and August 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	The Syndicated Line, together with the Cash Management Line, represents an increase in line capacity of more than 20%.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S5	Through an accordion feature, the maximum borrowing capacity on the Syndicated Line may be increased to up to $500.0 million under certain circumstances.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S6	The maturity date of the new lines is November 29, 2013, and we have an option to e xtend the lines for one year.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P90_S7	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a spread over LIBOR of 1.90% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.40% on the total committed amount.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The initial redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	In May 2009, exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership in the principal amount of $142.3 million were exchanged for Company common shares, representing approximately 95.2% of the total exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of approximately 9.7 million Company common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Following settlement of the exchange offer, exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million remained outstanding.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	In connection with the exchange offering, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	A portion of the debt discount recorded amounting to approximately $7.0 million was written-off as par t of the transaction.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	In August 2009, we completed an offering of 6.9 million common shares of the Company at a price of $17.75 per share, with net proceeds of approximately $116.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sel l debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our ex isting lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2013 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our dividend and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2010 .
1004036_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated deb t agreements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	For purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2010 was used.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have $8.3 million remaining as of December 31, 2010 related to the construction contract for the redevelopment of the Hilton Head, SC outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $43.0 million with a grand re-opening scheduled in April 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	The timing of these expenditures may vary due to delays in construction or acceleration of the opening date of this project.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our senior, unsecured notes contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Key financial covenants and their covenant levels include:
1004036_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	(1) For a complete listing of all debt covenants related to our senior unsecured notes, as well as definitions of the above terms, refer to our applicable filings with the SEC.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	Based on our 2010 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $39.6 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	We distributed approximately $68.1 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	If events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced, we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our REIT status.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2010 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	(1) Includes a 29,253 square foot warehouse adjacent to the shopping center with a mortgage note of appr oximately $2.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Each of the above ventures contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees and other provisions where a venture partner can force the other partners to either buy or sell their investment in the joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Should this occur, we may be required to sell the property to the venture partner or incur a significant cash outflow in order to maintain ownership of these outlet centers.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	In March 2005, we established the Wisconsin Dells joint venture to construct and operate a Tanger Outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	In December 2009, the joint venture closed on a new interest-only mortgage loan totaling $25.3 million that matures in December 2012.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	The new loan refinances the original construction loan and bears interest based on the LIBOR index plus 3.00%.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	The loan incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well a limited joint and several guarantee which in total is limited to interest costs plus 50% of the principal.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P110_S4	The loan currently has a balance of $24.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	In October 2003, we and two other members each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	In May 2007, the joint venture closed on the project financing which is structured in two parts.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The first is a $269.0 million loan collateralized by the property as well as limited joint and several guarantees by all three venture partners.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	These guarantees require the venture partners to cover any operating costs shortfalls, if any, including property taxes and interest costs but do not include any guarantee of loan principal.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	In addition, a completion guarantee remains in effect for the final construction phase of the center.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S4	The second is a $15.0 million mezzanine loan secured by the pledge of the partners' equity interests.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S5	The weighted average interest rate on the financing is one month LIBOR plus 1.49%.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S6	Over the life of the loans, if certain criteria are met, the weighted average interest rate can decrease to one month LIBOR plus 1.23%.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S7	The loans had a combined balance $266.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and are scheduled to mature in May 2011 with a one year extension option at that date.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S8	The extension option is contingent upon the joint venture property meeting certain financial and operational levels and th resholds.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S9	Based on the current cash flows and occupancy rate, the joint venture would not qualify for the one-year extension option and is currently in negotiations with the lending institution to refinance the existing loan.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S10	If the joint venture is unable to extend or refinance the loan, each joint venture partner may be required to make a material capital contribution.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P112_S11	If we were required to make a capital contribution, it would be funded by amounts available under our lines of credit.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	In June 2009, the two interest rate swaps entered into by Deer Park in 2007 with a notional amount totaling $170.0 million that had fixed the LIBOR index at an average of 5.38% related to Deer Park's $284.0 million construction loan expired.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	At that time, a forward starting interest rate cap purchased in February 2009 at a cost approximately $290,000 replaced these interest rate protection agreements as a hedge of interest rate risk.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	The agreement caps the 30-day LIBOR index at 4% on a notional amount of $240.0 million for a period through April 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	In June 2008, we and our two other partners formed a separate joint venture to acquire a 29,000 square foot warehouse adjacent to the shopping center to support the operations of the shopping center's tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Each partner maintains a 33.3% ownership interest in this joint venture which acquired the warehouse for a purchase price of $3.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	The venture also closed on a construction loan of $2.3 million with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.85% and a maturity of May 2011 with a one year extension option at that date.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	The extension option is contingent upon the joint venture property meeting certain financial and operational levels and thresholds.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S4	Based on the current cash flows and occupancy rate, the joint venture would not qualify for the one-year extension option and is currently in negotiations with the lending institution to refinance the existing loan.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P114_S5	If the joint venture is unable to extend or refinance the loan, each joint venture partner may be required to make a material capital contribution.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	The table above combines the operational and financial information of both Deer Park ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	During 2008, we made additional capital contributions of $1.6 million to Deer Park joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	Both of the other venture partners made equity contributions equal to ours.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P115_S3	After making the above contribution, the total amount of equity contributed by each venture partner to the projects was approximately $4.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The original purchase of the property in 2003 was in the form of a sale-leaseback transaction, which consisted of the sale of the property to Deer Park for $29 million, including a 900,000 square foot industrial building, which was then leased back to the seller under an operating lease agreement.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	At the end of the lease in May 2005, the tenant vacated the building.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	However, the tenant had not satisfied all of the conditions necessary to terminate the lease.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P116_S3	Deer Park is currently in litigation to recover from the tenant approximately $5.9 million for fourteen months of lease payments and additional rent reimbursements related to property taxes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P116_S4	In addition, Deer Park is seeking other damages and will continue to do so until recovered.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The following table details our share of the debt maturities of the unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	(1) The Deer Park mortgages have one-year extension options which are exercisable in May 2011, subject to certain qualifications.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	Based on the current cash flows and occupancy rate, the joint ventures would not qualify for the one-year extension option and are currently in negotiations with the lending institution to refinance the existing loans.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	If the joint ventures are unable to extend or refinance the loans, each joint venture partner may be required to make a material capital contribution.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	As noted above in Off-Bala nce Sheet Arrangements , we are 50% owners of the Wisconsin Dells joint venture and a 33.3% owner in the Deer Park joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	During 2008 we were also 50% owners of the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	These joint ventures pay us management, leasing and marketing fees, which we believe approximate current market rates, for services provided to the joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	During 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , we recognized the following fees (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Tanger Family Limited Partnership is a related party which holds a limited partn ership interest in and is the noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The only material related party transaction with the Tanger Family Limited Partnership is the payment of quarterly distributions of earnings which were $9.4 million, $9.3 million and $9.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, Stanley K. Tanger, our founder, transferred his general partnership interest in the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, to the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership is the noncontrolling interest in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	The sole trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trus t, and thus effectively the general partner of Tanger Family Limited Partnership, is John H. Vernon.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	Mr. Vernon is a partner at the law firm of Vernon, Vernon, Wooten, Brown, Andrews Garrett (the "Vernon Law Firm"), which has served as the principal outside counsel of the Company and Operating Partnership since their inception in 1993.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P122_S3	Based on Mr. Vernon's new position, as trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust, the general partner of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, he is now considered a related party.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P122_S4	However, Mr. Vernon has neither ownership rights nor economic interests in either the Tanger Family Limited Partnership or the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Fees paid to the Vernon Law Firm were approximately $1.1 million, $851,000 and $1.1 mil lion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, there were no amounts outstanding in accounts payable to the Vernon Law Firm.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non-controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decisions making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of th e associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P129_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	We capitalize all incremental, direct fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases as deferred charges.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	We amortize t hese costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term of five years.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	We capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest costs, once the development becomes probable.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the valu e of our long-lived assets.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P134_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2010 .
1004036_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the le ase.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P137_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	In December 2010, new accounting guidance was issued clarifying that the disclosure of supplementary proforma information for business combinations should be presented such that revenues and earnings of the combined entity are calculated as though the relevant business combinations that occurred during the current reporting period had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	The guidance also improves the usefulness of the supplementary proforma information by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring proforma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combinations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	Funds from Operations re presents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P140_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, indus try-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Other companies in our industr y may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only supplementally.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options and exchangeable notes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	(3) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	We present Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P148_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	In addition, we use AFFO, or some form of AFFO, when certain material, unplanned transactions occur, as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P152_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only supplementally.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	B elow is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options and exchangeable notes.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	(3) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P155_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	As typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	In July 2010, Liz Claiborne announced their intention to transition out of their branded outlet stores.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P158_S1	At that time, the Liz Claiborne brand occupied 22 stores with approximat ely 233,000 square feet, or 2.6% of our portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P158_S2	The combined annualized base and percentage rental revenue from these stores represented less than 1.5% of our total base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P158_S3	As of February 1, 2011, we have successfully retenanted approximately 188,000, or 81%, of the spaces vacated by the Liz Claiborne brand with brands such as Donna Karan, Talbots, Chico's, JoS. A Bank, American Eagle, Forever 21 and Ann Taylor/Loft.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	During 2010 , approximately 1.5 million square feet, or 16% , of our wholly-owned portfolio came up for renewal and 1.7 million square feet, or 18% of our wholly-owned portfolio, will come up for renewal in 2011 .
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	During 2010 , we renewed 83% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 9% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S3	We also re-tenanted 432,000 square feet at a 26% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P159_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 8.4% of our square feet or 6.6% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P160_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_11_ITEM7_P160_S4	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively, occupancy at our wholly-owned centers was 98% and 96%.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In June 2010, we terminated our only two LIBOR based interest rate swap agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and BB T for notional amounts of $118.0 million and $117.0 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The purpose of these swaps was to fix the interest rate on the $235.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility completed in June 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S5	The swaps fixed the one month LIBOR rate at 3.605% and 3.70%, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S6	The term loan was repaid with proceeds from our $300.0 million 6.125% unsecured bond offering.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S7	Since the debt underlying the interes t rate swaps was retired, we terminated the related interest rate swap agreements.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P1_S8	As of December 31, 2010, we were not a party to any interest rate protection agreements.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , 22% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $1.6 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, exchangeable notes, unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $770.1 million and $567.0 million, respectively, and its recorded value was $714.6 million and $584.6 million , respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately $35.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger, and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2010 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Co mpany's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P60_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P60_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P60_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P60_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc ounting principles.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , we owned and operated 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 9.2 million square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	These outlet centers were 98% occupied and contained over 2,000 stores, representing approximately 360 store brands.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Also, we operated and had partial ownership interests in two outlet centers totaling approximately 948,000 square feet.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P73_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P73_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	We own the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Tanger GP Trust and the Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Tanger family, through its ownership of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership holds the remaining units as a limited partner.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , our wholly-owned subsidiaries owned 20,249,017 units of the Operating Partnership and the Tanger Family Limited Partnership owned the remaining 3,033,305 units.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	Each Tanger Family Limited Partnership unit is exchangeable for four of our common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve our status as a REIT.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P76_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non-controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we performed an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they would qualify as variable interest entities ("VIE"), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that Deer Park is a VIE and Wisconsin Dells is not a VIE.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	Deer Park is considered a VIE because it does not meet the criteria of the members having a sufficient equity investment at risk.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	After making the determination that Deer Park was a VIE, we performed an assessment to determine if we would be considered the primary beneficiary and thus be required to consolidate Deer Park's balance sheets and results of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	This assessment was based upon whether we had the following:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	Based on the provisions of the operating and management agreements of Deer Park, we determined that no one member alone has the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of Deer Park.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	We have determined that all three partners share power in the decisions that most significantly impact Deer Park, as well as the financial rights and obligations, and therefore we are not required to consolidate Deer Park.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	Our equity method investment in Deer Park as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $1.6 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and based on the future operating performance of Deer Park.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P81_S3	Our maximum exposure consists of the following components: our investment, our completion guarantee which is currently estimated to be up to $15.0 million and our other operating performance guarantees.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Share Split - The Company's Board of Directors declared a 2 for 1 split of the Company's common shares on January 13, 2011, effected in the form of a share dividend, payable on January 24, 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company retained the current par value of $.01 per share for all common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	All references to the number of shares outstanding, per share amounts and share option data of the Company's common shares have been restated to reflect t he effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S3	Shareholders' equity reflects the split by reclassifying from additional paid in capital to common shares an amount equal to the par value of the additional shares arising from the split.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S4	While the number of Operating Partnership units did not change as a result of the split, each Tanger Family Limited Partnership unit is now exchangeable for four of the Company's common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P82_S5	Previously, the exchange ratio was one unit for two common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interest in Operating Partnership reflects the Tanger Family Limited Partnership's percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	Income is allocated to the Tanger Family Limited Partnership based on its respective ownership interest.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	Related Parties - The Tanger Family Limited Partnership, see Noncontrolling interests , is a related party which holds a limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and is reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	See Note 24 for further discussion of the relationship and transactions between the Tanger Family Limited Partnership and the Company and Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	The nature of our relationships and the related party transactions for our unconsolidated joint ventures are also discussed in Note 4.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumption s that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Operating Segments - We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	Costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including certain general and overhead costs, are capitalized.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P88_S2	The amount of general and overhead costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P88_S3	Direct costs to acquire existing centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 25 to 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and seven years for equipment.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P89_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P89_S4	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P91_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as landscaping and infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	Interest costs capitalized during 2010 , 2009 and 2008 amounted to approximately $1.5 million, $300,000 and $1.7 million, respectively, and internal development costs capitalized amounted to $1.5 million, $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in income from continuing oper ations for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 was $64.5 million, $64.5 million and $49.0 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	These costs are trans ferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P94_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered t o be cash equivalents.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively, we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $550,000 and $750,000, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the average minimum lease term of 5 years.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including internal lease costs and amounts paid to third-party brokers, during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $6.1 million, $4.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P98_S2	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P98_S3	See Rental Property above for a discussion.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is ret ired before the maturity date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	Captive Insurance - Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northline Indemnity, LLC, is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	We recognized impairment losses of $846,000 and $5.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P102_S2	We believe there are no unrecorded impairment losses as of December 31, 2010 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	Real estate assets designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	We classify real estate as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P103_S3	The operating results of real estate assets designated as held for sale and for assets sold are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our results of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are b ased on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protect ion agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P106_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P106_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P107_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P108_S6	The tax years 2007 - 2010 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	In No vember 2005, we issued 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares (liquidation preference $25.00 per share).
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	In 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $1.88 per share, of which $1.85 was treated as ordinary income and $.03 of which was treated as a capital gain distribution.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S2	We paid preferred cash dividends per share of $2.07 and $1.88 in 2010 and 2008, respectively, all of which were treated as ordinary income.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S3	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S4	The initial redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P109_S5	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	Dividends per share were taxable as follows:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 :
1004036_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P112_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded in other assets were approximately $16.7 million and $14.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising an d promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	We provide management, leasing and development services for a fee for certain properties that we partially own through a joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	Fees received for these services are recognized as other income when earned.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2010 , 2009 or 2008 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Riverhead, New York center is the only property that comprises more than 10% of our consolidated gross revenues.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	The Riverhead center, originally constructed in 1994, represented approximately 12% of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P118_S2	The Riverhead center contained 729,475 square feet as of December 31, 2010 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P118_S3	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	In addition, rental property increased by $32.0 million related to the fair market valuation of our previously held interest in excess of carrying amount.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	We also completed a non-cash exchange offer, as described in Note 9, which resulted in the retirement of $142.3 million in principal amount of exchangeable notes which had a carrying value of $135.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	These notes were retired concurrent with the issuance of approximately 9.7 million common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	In August 2009, we closed on the sale of an outparcel of land at our property in Washington, PA.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	A non-cash condition of the sale was the assumption by the buyer of approximately $2.6 million of the tax increment financing liability associated with the property.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	During the second quarter of 2008, upon the closing of our LIBOR based unsecured term loan facility, we determined that we were unlikely to enter into a US Treasury based debt offering.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	In accordance with accounting guidance for derivatives, we reclassified to earnings in the period the amount recorded in other comprehensive income, $17.8 million, related to these derivatives.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S2	This amount had been frozen as of March 31, 2008 when we determined that the probability of the forecast transaction was reasonably possible instead of probable .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S3	Effective April 1, 2008, we discontinued hedge accounting and the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts subsequent to April 1, 2008 resulted in a gain of $8.9 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S4	The accounting treatment of these derivatives resulted in a net loss on settlement of $8.9 million which has been reflected in the statement of cash flows as a non-cash operating activity.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P123_S5	The $8.9 million cash settlement of the derivatives during the second quarter was reflected in the statement of cash flows as a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We may issue non-qualified options and other eq uity-based awards under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan, or the Incentive Award Plan.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements - In December 2010, new accounting guidance was issued clarifying that the disclosure of supplementary proforma information for business combinations should be presented such that revenues and earnings of the combined entity are calculated as though the relevant business combinations that occurred during the current reporting period had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	The guidance also improves the usefuln ess of the supplementary proforma information by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring proforma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combinations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	In November 2010, we opened our newest Tanger outlet center in Mebane, North Carolina 100% occupied.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P126_S1	The n ew center contains approximately 319,000 square feet and approximately 80 outlet tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P126_S2	The total cost for the center was approximately $64.9 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	During 2010, we began execution of a redevelopment plan for our Hilton Head I, South Carolina center.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	The plan included a complete demolition of the existing 162,000 square foot center originally acquired in 2003.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P127_S2	The center, which is scheduled to re-open the first weekend of April 2011, will contain app roximately 176,000 square feet as well as four outparcel pads.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P127_S3	The total incremental cost for the redeveloped center is expected to be approximately $43.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	During the second quarter of 2009, we completed construction of a 23,000 square foot expansion at our Commerce II, Georgia outlet center.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	The majority of the tenants opened during the second quarter of 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	In 2005, we sold our outlet center located in Seymour, Indiana but retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we sold in recent years.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P130_S2	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land, we accounted for the land as "held for sale" and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P130_S3	We determined the fair value using a market approach considering offers that we obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P130_S4	See Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	Two of the outparcels were sold during the first half of 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $200,000 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	We continue to actively market the remaining parcels.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved the plan for our management to sell our Commerce I, Georgia center.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	The majority of the center was sold in July 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $1.4 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S2	The remaining portion of the center, classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, was sold at the end of January 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S3	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the center to its approximate fair value based on the actual sales contracts related the center.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S4	In the second quarter 2009, we recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations whi ch equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value at that time.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P132_S5	We determined the fair value in 2009 using a market approach whereby we considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	In December 2006 the Redevelopment Authority of Washington County, Pennsylvania issued tax increment financing bonds to finance a portion of the public infrastructure improvements related to the construction of the Tanger outlet center in Washington, PA.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	We received the net proceeds from the bond issuance as reimbursement for funds expended on qualifying assets as defined in the bond agreement.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P133_S2	Debt service of these bonds is funded by 80% of the incremental real property taxes assessed within the tax increment financing district and any shortfalls in the debt service are funded by special assessments on the Washington, PA property.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	We originally recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet approximately $17.9 million which represents the funds that we have received and expect to receive from the bonds.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	Associated with this liability is a discount of $5.7 million representing the difference between the amount received and the total amount of the bonds issued.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	The principal amount of bonds issued totaled $23.6 million, mature in July 2035 and bear interest at an effective rate of 7.81% and a stated rate of 5.45%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P134_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010 , approximately $1.2 million of interest expense related to this bond is included in the consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P134_S4	As of December 31, 2010 the bonds had a net carrying amount of $15.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	As discussed in Note 6, a portion of the bonds totaling $2.6 million was assumed by the buyer in an outparcel sale transaction in August 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	Estimated principal reductions in aggregate over the next 5 years are expected to be $1.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	During 2009, we obtained approval from Beaufort County, South Carolina to implement a redevelopment plan at the Hilton Head I, SC outlet cente r. Based on the redevelopment timeline, we intended to demolish the existing buildings during the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	Therefore, we changed the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets to end at the date the center was expected to be vacant in preparation for demolition.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	As a result of this change in useful lives, additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.0 million and $6.3 million was recognized during the 2010 and 2009 period, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P136_S3	The accelerated depreciation and amortization reduced income from continuing operations and net income by approximately $.10 and $.08 per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P136_S4	Once the demolition was completed during the second quarter of 2010, the fully depreciated assets were written-off.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 aggregated $6.4 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P137_S1	We have evaluated the accounting treatment for each of the joint ventures and have concluded based on the current facts and circumstances that the equity method of accounting should be used to account for the individual joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P137_S2	At December 31, 2010 , we were members of the following unconsolidated real estate joint ventures:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	(1) Includes a 29,253 square foot warehouse adjacent to the shopping center with a mortgage note of approximately $2.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting as described below.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	The following management, leasing and marketing fees were recognized from services provided to Wisconsin Dells, Deer Park and Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 (2008 only)(in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Our investments in real estate joint ventures are reduced by 50% of the profits earned for leasing services to Wisconsin Dells and 33.3% of the profits earned for leasing services provided to Deer Park.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	o the book basis, including intercompany profits on sales of services that are capitalized by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P141_S2	The differences in basis are amortized over the various useful lives of the related assets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	In October 2003, we, and two other members each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	In May 2007, the joint venture closed on the project financing which is structured in two parts.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	The first is a $269.0 million loan collateralized by the property as well as limited joint and several guarantees by all three venture partners.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S2	These guarantees require the venture partners to cover any operating costs shortfalls, if any, including property taxes and interest costs but do not include any guarantee of loan principal.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S3	In addition, a completion guarantee remains in effect for the final construction phase of the center.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S4	The second is a $15.0 million mezzanine loan secured by the pledge of the partners' equity interests.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S5	The weighted average interest rate on the financing is one month LIBOR plus 1.49%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S6	Over the life of the loans, if certain criteria are met, the weighted average interest rate can decrease to one month LIBOR plus 1.23%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S7	The loans had a combined balance $266.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and are scheduled to mature in May 2011 with a one year extension option at that date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S8	The extension option is contingent upon the joint venture property meeting certain financial and operational levels and thresholds.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S9	Based on the current cash flows and occupancy rate, the joint venture would not qualify for the one-year extension option and is currently in negotiations with the lending institution to refinance the existing loan.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P143_S10	If the joint venture is unable to extend or refinance the l oan, each joint venture partner may be required to make a material capital contribution.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	In June 2009, the two interest rate swaps entered into by Deer Park in 2007 with a notional amount totaling $170.0 million that had fixed the LIBOR index at an average of 5.38% related to Deer Park's $284.0 million construction loan expired.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	At that time, a forward starting interest rate cap originally purchased by Deer Park in February 2009 at a cost approximately $290,000 replaced these interest rate protection agreements as a hedge of interest rate risk.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P144_S2	The agreement caps the 30-day LIBOR index at 4% on a notional amount of $240.0 million for a period through April 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	In June 2008, we, and our two other partners formed a separate joint venture to acquire a 29,000 square foot warehouse adjacent to the shopping center to support the operations of the shopping center's tenants.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	Each partner maintains a 33.3% ownership interest in this joint venture which acquired the warehouse for a purchase price of $3.3 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S2	The venture also obtained $2.3 million in financing at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.85% and a maturity of May 2011 with a one year extension option at that date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S3	The extension option is contingent upon the joint venture property meeting certain financial and operational levels and thresholds.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S4	Based on the current cash flows and occupancy rate, the joint venture would not qualify for the one-year extension option and is currently in negotiations with the lending institution to refinance the existing loan.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P145_S5	If the joint ve nture is unable to extend or refinance the loan, each joint venture partner may be required to make a material capital contribution.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	During 2008, we made additional capital contributions of $1.6 million to the Deer Park joint venture.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	Both of the other venture partners made equity contributions equal to ours.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P146_S2	After making the above contribution, the total amount of equity contributed by each venture partner to the projects was approximately $4.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	In March 2005, we established the Wisconsin Dells joint venture to construct and operate a Tanger Outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	In December 2009, the joint venture closed on a new interest-only mortgage loan totaling $25.3 million that matures in December 2012.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P147_S2	The new loan refinances the original construction loan and bears interest based on the LIBOR index plus 3.00%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P147_S3	The loan incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well a limited joint and several guarantee which in total is limited to interest costs plus 50% of the principal.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P147_S4	The loan currently has a balance of $24.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	On January 5, 2009, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture for a cash price of $32.0 million and the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of $35.8 million.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had $160.0 million outstanding in total on these lines.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P164_S2	The Company also guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to its $7.2 million of outstanding senior exchangeable notes due in 2026.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P164_S3	However, August 18, 2011 is the first date that the noteholders can require us to repurchase the notes without the occurrence of specified events.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	Debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 consists of the following (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	(1) The effective rate on this facility due to interest rate swap agreements was 5.25%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P166_S1	The facility was repaid and terminated in June 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	(2) Our unsecured lines of credit as of December 31, 2010 bear interest at a rate of LIBOR +1.90% and expire in November 2013.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P167_S1	These lines require a facility fee payment of .40% annually based on the total amount of the commitment.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P167_S2	The credit spread and facility fee can vary depending on our investment grade rating.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	(3) Because this mortgage debt was assumed as part of an acquisition, the debt was recorded at its fair value and carried an effective interest rate of 5.34%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	The unsecured lines of credit and senior unsecured notes include covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% of funds from operations on a cumulative basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P169_S1	As of December 31, 2010 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	In June 2010, the Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $300.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes").
1004036_11_ITEM15_P170_S1	The 2020 Notes pay interest semi-annually and were priced at 99.310% of the principal amount to yield 6.219% to maturity.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	We used the n et proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Notes to (i) repay our $235 million unsecured term loan due in June 2011, (ii) pay approximately $6.1 million to terminate two interest rate swap agreements associated with the term loan, (iii) repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and (iv) for general working capital purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	No prepayment or early termination penalty was paid as a result of the repayment of the term loan; however, unamortized loan origination costs of approximately $563,000 were written-off during the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	In November 2010, the Operating Partnership entered into a $385.0 million syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit (the "Syndicated Line").
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S1	In addition to the Syndicated Line, the Operating Partnership simultaneously entered into a $15.0 millio n cash management line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Cash Management Line"), providing total revolving line capacity of $400.0 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S2	The Cash Management Line's terms are substantially the same as the Syndicated Line, including maturity date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S3	The Syndicated Line replaces our previous $325.0 million in bilateral lines of credit that were scheduled to mature between June and August 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S4	The Syndicated Line, together with the Cash Management Line, represents an increase in line capacity of more than 20%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S5	Through an accordion feature, the maximum borrowing capacity on the Syndicated Line may be increased to up to $500.0 million under certain circumstances.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S6	The maturity date of the new lines is November 29, 2013, and we have an option to extend the lines for one ye ar.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P173_S7	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a spread over LIBOR of 1.90% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.40% on the total committed amount.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	In May 2009, exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership in the principal amount of $142.3 million were exchanged for common shares of the Company, representing approximately 95.2% of the total exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P174_S1	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of 9,734,876 common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P174_S2	Following settlement of the exchange offer, exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million remained outstanding.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P174_S3	In connection with the exchange offering, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P174_S4	A portion of the debt discount recorded amounting to approximately $7.0 million was written-off as part of the transaction.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	In July 2009, Wells Fargo Bank increased the size of its unsecured line of credit from $100.0 million to $125.0 million allowing us to continue to maintain $325.0 million in unsecured lines of credit simultaneous with the natural expiration of our $25.0 million unsecured line of credit with Wachovia Bank.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	Maturities of the existing long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
1004036_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	In accordance with our derivatives policy, all derivatives are assessed for effectiveness at the time the contracts are entered into and are assessed for effectiveness on an on-going basis at each quarter end.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	All of our derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P179_S2	Unrealized gains and losses related to the effective portion of our derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income and gains or losses related to ineffective portions are recognized in the income statement.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	In our March 31, 2008 assessment of the two US treasury rate lock derivatives, we concluded that as of March 31, 2008, the occurrence of the forecasted transactions were considered reasonably possible instead of probable .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P180_S1	Accordingly, amounts previously deferred in other comprehensive income remain frozen until the forecasted transaction either affected earnings or subsequently became not probable of occurring.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P180_S2	The value of the derivatives as of March 31, 2008 included in other comprehensive income and liabilities was $17.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P180_S3	Also, hedge accounting was discontinued going forward and changes in fair value related to these two derivatives after April 1, 2008 were recognized in the statement of operations immediately.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	In conjunction with the closing of the unsecured term loan facility discussed above, we settled two interest rate lock protection agreements which were intended to fix the US Treasury index at an average rate of 4.62% for an aggregate amount of $200.0 million of new debt for 10 years from July 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	We originally entered into these agreements in 2005 in anticipation of executing a public debt offering during 2008 that would be based on the 10 year US Treasury rate.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P181_S2	Upon the closing of the LIBOR based unsecured term loan facility, we determined that we were unlikely to execute a US Treasury based debt offering.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P181_S3	The settlement of the interest rate lock protection agreements, at a total cost of $8.9 million, was reflected as a loss on termination of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	In July 2008 and September 2008, we entered into LIBOR based interest rate swap agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and BB T for notional amounts of $118.0 million and $117.0 million respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S1	The purpose of these swaps was to fix the interest rate on the $235.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility completed in June 2008.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S2	The swaps fixed the one month LIBOR rate at 3.605% and 3.70%, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S3	When combined with the current spread of 160 basis points, which can vary based on changes in our debt ratings, these swap agreements fixed our interest rate on the $235.0 million of variable rate debt at 5.25% until April 1, 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S4	In the second quarter of 2010 we paid $6.1 million to terminate the two interest rate swaps because the underlying debt for the derivative transaction was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the $300.0 million bond offering.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P182_S5	The payment was reflected as a loss on termination of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	The table below presents the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 , respectively (in millions):
1004036_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	(1) The derivative not designated as a hedging instrument was the interest rate swap agreement assumed when we purchased the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture that owned the outlet center in Myrtle Beach, SC on Hwy 17.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P184_S1	We c ould not qualify for hedge accounting for this assumed derivative which had a fair value of $1.7 million upon acquisition and was recorded in other liabilities in the balance sheet.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P184_S2	Changes in fair value of this derivative are recorded through the statement of operations until its expiration in March 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The remaining net benefit from a derivative settled during 2005 in accumulated other comprehensive income was an unamortized balance as of December 31, 2010 of $1.8 million which will amortize into the statement of operations through October 2015.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	This note contains required fair value disclosures for certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	We periodica lly enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and to hedge anticipated future financings similar to those described in Note 10.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P187_S2	These instruments are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	In addition, rental property is considered a nonfinancial asset and the testing of it for impairment is considered nonrecurring in nature.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, the definition of fair value in the context of an impairment evaluation became the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	Fair value guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P190_S1	These tiers are defined as follows:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	The valuation of our financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P191_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P191_S2	The valuation also includes a discount for counterparty risk.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	We have determined that our derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, quantitative disclosure of the fair value for each major category of assets and liabilities is presented below:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	Significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Liabilities:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	(1) We were not a party to any derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	Significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Liabilities:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	(2) Included in "Other liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, exchangeable notes, unsecured term credit facilities and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $770.1 million and $567.0 million, respectively, and its recorded value was $714.6 million and $584.6 million, respectively.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	The initial redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P199_S2	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	In May 2009, exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership, originally issued in August 2006, in the principal amount of $142.3 million were exchanged for common shares of the Company, representing approximately 95.2% of the total exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of 9,734,876 common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P200_S2	Following settlement of the exchange offer, exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million remained outstanding.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P200_S3	In connection with the exchange offer, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P200_S4	A portion of the debt discount recorded amounting to approximately $7.0 million was written-off as part of the transaction.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	In August 2009, the Company completed a common share offering of 6,900,000 shares at a price of $17.75 per share, with net proceeds of approximately $116.8 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	Each unit held by the Noncontrolling Interest in the Operating Partnership is exchangeable for four of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve our status as a REIT.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	Accordingly, 12,133,220 common shares are reserved for the potential exchange of Operating Partnership units.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon exercise of options or i ssuance of restricted share awards, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding unit to the Company on a four shares for one unit basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P203_S1	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 , the ownership interests of the Operating Partnership consisted of the following:
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company, retired as an employee of the Company and resigned as Chairman of the Board effective September 1, 2009.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S1	Pursuant to Mr. Tanger's employment agreement, as mutually agreed upon by the Company and Mr. Tanger, he received a cash severance amount of $ 3.4 million.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S2	Additionally, the Board approved a modification to Mr. Tanger's restricted share agreements whereas, upon his retirement, 432,000 unvested restricted common shares previously granted to Mr. Tanger vested.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S3	As a result of this vesting, we recorded $6.9 million in incremental share-based compensation expense.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S4	Mr. Tanger's severance costs are included in the general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P204_S5	Mr. Tanger continued to serve as a member of the Company's Board of Directors until his passing on October 23, 2010.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share amounts).
1004036_11_ITEM15_P205_S1	Note that per share amounts have been restated to reflect a two-for-one s plit of the Company's common shares in January 2011.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	The exchangeable notes are included in the diluted earnings per share computation, if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P206_S1	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect will be dilutive if the average market price of our common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter is higher than the exchange price of $17.87 per share.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P207_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P207_S1	No options were excluded from the 2010, 2009 or 2008 computations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P207_S2	The assumed conversion of the partnership units held by the nonc ontrolling interest limited partner as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a partnership unit, as if converted, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	The Company's unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P208_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P208_S2	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P208_S3	The notional units were issued in January 2010 and all have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 as none of the contingent conditions were satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per unit amounts):
1004036_11_ITEM15_P210_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon exercise of options or issuance of restricted share awards, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding unit to the Company on a four shares for one unit basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	The senior exchangeable notes are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation, if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect will be dilutive if the average market price of the Company's common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter is higher than the exchange price of $17.87 per common share.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P213_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P214_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to four times the market price of the Company's common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P214_S1	No options were excluded from the 2010 , 2009 or 2008 computations.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P215_S0	The Company's unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P215_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P216_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P216_S1	The notional units were issued in January 2010 and all have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per unit for the year ended December 31, 2010 as none of the contingent conditions were satisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P217_S0	We have a shareholder approved share-based compensation plan, the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P217_S1	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P217_S2	Through December 31, 2010 , we had granted 5,049,960 options, net of options forfeited, and 2,457,420 restricted share awards, net of restricted shares forfeited, and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 1,230,000 common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P217_S3	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 4,260,620 common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P217_S4	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan are determined by the Share and Unit Option Committee of the Board of Directors.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P218_S0	All non-qualified options granted under the Plan expire 10 years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P219_S0	Options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common shares on the day of grant.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P219_S1	Units received upon exercise of unit options are exchangeable for common shares.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P219_S2	There were no option grants in 2010 , 2009 and 2008 .
1004036_11_ITEM15_P220_S0	During 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , the Board of Directors approved the grant of 312,720, 415,000 and 380,000 restricted shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P220_S1	The independent directors' restricted shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P220_S2	For all of the restricted awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the market price of our common shares on the date of grant and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P221_S0	Also during the first quarter of 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee Approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, (the "2010 Multi Year Perform ance Plan").
1004036_11_ITEM15_P221_S1	Under the 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, we granted 410,000 notional units to award recipients as a group.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P222_S0	If the Company's aggregate share price appreciation during the four year period beginning January 1, 2010 equals or exceeds the minimum threshold of 40%, then the notional units will convert into the Company's restricted common shares on a one-for-one basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P222_S1	The notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for-two basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the target threshold of 50% and on a one-for-three basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the maximum of 60%.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P222_S2	The notional amounts will convert on a pro-rata basis between share price appreciation thresholds.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P222_S3	The share price targets will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period, subject to a minimum level price target.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P222_S4	For notional amounts granted in 2010, any shares earned on December 31, 2013 will vest on December 31, 2014 co ntingent on continued employment through the vesting date.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P223_S0	The notional units, prior to the date they are converted into restricted common shares, will not entitle award recipients to receive any dividends or other distributions.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P223_S1	If the notional units are earned, and thereby converted into restricted common shares, then award recipients will be entitled to receive a payment of all dividends and other distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned common shares been issued at the beginning of the performance period.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P223_S2	Thereafter, dividends and other distributions will be paid currently with respect to all restricted common shares that were earned.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P224_S0	At the end of the four-year performance period, if the minimum share price threshold is not achieved but the Company's share performance exceeds the 50th percentile of the share performance of its peer group, the notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for-one basis.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P224_S1	All determinations, interpretations and assumptions relating to the vesting and calculation of the performance awards will be made by the Company's Compensation Committee.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P225_S0	We recorded share based compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively, as follows (in thousands):

1004036_11_ITEM15_P228_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2010 had the following weighted average exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual lives:

1004036_11_ITEM15_P233_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.6 years.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P234_S0	As discussed in Note 17, the Operating Partnership and the Company have a joint plan whereby equity based and performance based awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P235_S0	When shares are issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues corresponding units to the Company based on the current exchange ratio as provided by the Operating Partnership agreement.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P235_S1	Based on the current exchange ratio, each unit in the Operating Partnership is equivalent to four common shares of the Company.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P235_S2	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P236_S0	The maximum units that may be issued to the Company due to e quity awards granted by the Company are limited by the Plan to 15.4 million of the Company's common shares, or in terms of units, 3,850,000 units.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P254_S1	As discussed in Note 2, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership is the noncontrolling interest in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P254_S2	The sole trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust, and thus effectively the general partner of Tanger Family Limited Partnership, is John H. Vernon.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P254_S3	Mr. Vernon is a partner at the law firm of Vernon, Vernon, Wooten, Brown, Andrews Garrett, or the Vernon Law Firm, which has served as the principal outside counsel of the Company and Operating Partnership since their inception in 1993.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P254_S4	Based on Mr. Vernon's new position as trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust, the general partner of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, he is now considered a related party.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P254_S5	Ho wever, Mr. Vernon has neither ownership rights nor economic interests in either the Tanger Family Limited Partnership or the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust.

1004036_11_ITEM15_P257_S0	In January 2011, we announced that we entered into a letter of intent with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to form an exclusive joint venture for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P257_S1	Any projects developed will be co-owned on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_11_ITEM15_P257_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	As a result, the joint venture has accrued interest at a default rate of 8.25% from May 17, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and is currently in negotiations with the lender.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these negotiations.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	During 2011 we announced the formation of an exclusive joint venture (the "Canadian Joint Venture") with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust ("RioCan") for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Through December 31, 2011, we have contributed approximately $1.0 million to fund pre-development and due diligence costs for various sites.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Any projects developed will be co-owned by us and RioCan on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	It is the intention of the joint venture to develop as many as 10 to 12 outlet centers in larger urban markets and tourist areas across Canada, over a five to seven year period.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The typical size of a Tanger Outlet Center is approximately 350,000 square feet depending on the individual market and tenant demand.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Assuming these parameters are suitable and materialize in Canada, the overall investment of the joint venture is anticipated to be as high as $1.0 billion, on a fully built out basis.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	There can be no assurance that the current plans of the joint venture to develop outlet centers in Canada as described above will be fully realized.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	In connection with the purchase, the joint venture assumed the in place financing of $29.6 million which carries an interest rate of 5.1% and matures in 2014.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Cookstown Outlet Mall is north of the Greater Toronto Area in Innisfil, Ontario, and contains approximately 159,000 square feet with the potential to expand to approximately 320,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	This outlet center features many national retailers such as, Coach Outlet, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger Outlet, Puma and Rockport.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	The acquisition of this property will enable the Canadian Joint Venture to begin to implement its outlet center strategy immediately, as well as provide the flexibility to potentially expand the site into a full-scale Tanger Outlet Center.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	In May 2011 , we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture agreement with The Peterson Companies for the development of Tanger Outlets at National Harbor in the Washington, D.C. area.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	National Harbor, includes fine restaurants, distinctive retail, office and residences, and a number of world-class hotels including the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Currently, we expect the outlet center to contain approximately 328,000 square feet and to be open in time for the 2012 holiday shopping season.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period of other potential developments, including sites located in Scottsdale, AZ, as well as Halton Hills and Ottawa, Ontario.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Ontario sites, if developed, will be undertaken by our Canadian Joint Venture with our RioCan partner (see previous discussion under the caption RioCan Canadian Joint Venture ).
1004036_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites in the United States.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	There can be no assurance that any of these sites will be ultimately developed.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we typically use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources previously described.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	In June 2011, the Operating Partnership closed on a $150.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% and used the proceeds from the loan to fund the acquisition of the Jeffersonville, OH outlet center.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	On November 10, 2011, the Operating Partnership amended its $400.0 million of unsecured lines of credit, increasing the total capacity to $520.0 million (of which up to $100.0 million may be borrowed in Canadian dollars) and extending the maturity through November 10, 2015 .
1004036_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line as well as a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	The syndicated line may be increased to $750.0 million through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	We have the option to extend the lines for an additional year to November 10, 2016 .
1004036_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a credit spread over LIBOR of 1.25% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.25% on the total committed amount.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	Previously, the credit spread over LIBOR was 1.90% and the annual facility fee was 0.40% .

1004036_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our $520.0 million unsecured lines of credit.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	In December 2011, Chad D. Perry joined our management team as Executive Vice President - General Counsel.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Mr. Perry brings nearly 15 years of experience to the Company.

1004036_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Outlets are stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Outlet centers offer numerous advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, which enhance their profit potential.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Outlet centers enable them to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	In addition, outlet centers benefit manufacturers and brand name retailers by permitting them to sell out-of-season, overstocked or discontinued merchandise without alienating department stores or hampering the manufacturer's brand name, as is often the case when merchandise is distributed via discount chains.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide as high of an initial return on investment as has been historically achieved.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Each of our outlet centers carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have developed long-standing relationships with many of our tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Because of our established relationships, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,736 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	We have a diverse tenant base comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach Leatherware, Eddie Bauer, GAP, J. Crew, Juicy, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand Jeans, Michael Kors, Nike, Old Navy, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue - Off Fifth, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour and others.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	As of December 31 2011, no single tenant accounted for more than 8.0% of our leasable square feet or 6.5% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	Because our typical tenant is a large, national manufacturer, we generally do not experience any material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 91% of our total revenues in 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues in 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the country.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with approximately 400 brand name manufacturers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 31 years.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated outlet centers were 99% occupied with average tenant sales of $366 per square foot.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development and operation of manufacturers' outlet centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing centers, renovating and expanding our mature centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of new outlet centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	Future centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe our 31 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P52_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	We typically prefer that at least 50% of the space in each center is pre-leased prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may occasionally proceed with construction with less than 50% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	This pre-leasing policy is consistent with our conservative financing perspective and the discipline we impose upon ourselves.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to the opening of the first tenant stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Keeping our shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a remerchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	The long-standing retailer relationships that we enjoy allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	In order for our centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, website, internet advertising, social networks, smart phone applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new center.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls and full- and off-price retailers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P68_S3	Traditional full- and off-price retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers be located not less than 10 miles from the nearest major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	For this reason, our centers compete only to a very limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	We compete directly with one large national owner of outlet centers and numerous small owners, however, there is the potential for increased competition from other developers who have announced plans to enter the outlet industry.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	We believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to minimize the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina in which our corporate headquarters is located.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	In addition, we rent a regional office in New York City, New York to better service our principal fashion-related tenants, many of whom are based in and around that area.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	We maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 36 centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease agreement with us.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	As of February 1, 2012, we had 224 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in New York and 36 business offices.
1004036_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	At that date, we also employed 252 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We intend to grow our business through acquisitions and developments.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Such bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders interests.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We own partial interests in three outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions by the managing member that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, ongoing operations, financing or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of war and earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Historically high fuel prices may impact consumer travel and spending habits.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Most shoppers use private automobile transportation to travel to our outlet centers and many of our centers are not easily accessible by public transportation.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Increasing fuel costs may reduce the number of trips to our centers thus reducing the amount spent at our centers.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Many of our outlet center locations near tourist destinations may experience an even more acute reduction of shoppers if there were a reduction of people opting to drive to vacation destinations.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Such reductions in traffic could adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Increasing fuel costs may also reduce disposable income and decrease demand for retail products.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such a decrease could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2012, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers totaling 10.7 million square feet located in 24 states.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in three other outlet centers totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including one outlet center in Ontario, Canada.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,736 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our Riverhead, New York center is the only property that represented 10% or more of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our Atlantic City, NJ center is the only property that represents 10% or more of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	See Properties - Significant Property for further details.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring centers, developing new centers and expanding existing centers.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of the 36 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 30 and have ground leases on six.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the six centers are located:
1004036_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S0	The initial term of our typical tenant lease averages approximately five years.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S1	Generally, leases provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S2	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S3	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S4	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable center.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P5_S5	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P9_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2012, scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P10_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 669,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P10_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2012 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P10_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P11_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P12_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P13_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P13_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers.

1004036_12_ITEM2_P15_S3	The Atlantic City outlet center, acquired during 2011, represented 10% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM2_P16_S0	Tenants at the Riverhead and Atlantic City centers principally conduct retail sales operations.

1004036_12_ITEM2_P18_S0	Depreciation on the outlet centers is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P18_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 33 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P18_S2	Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P19_S0	At December 31, 2011, the net federal tax basis of the Riverhead and Atlantic City outlet centers was approximately $230.4 million.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P19_S1	Real estate taxes assessed on these centers during 2011 amounted to $4.9 million.
1004036_12_ITEM2_P19_S2	Real estate taxes for 2012 are estimated to be approximately $5.0 million.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	In addition, percentage rentals increased in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period primarily as a result of the additional centers added to the portfolio during 2011, as well as the full year effect of the Mebane, NC outlet center which opened in November 1, 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $9.0 million , or 11% , in the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Existing property expense reimbursements increased in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period as a result of an increase in the portfolio's overall occupancy rate as well an increase in the number of leases executed which require reimbursement of operating expenses.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase was primarily due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2011 restricted share grant to directors and certain officers of the Company and organizational costs related to the formation of additional unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Also, the 2011 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2010 period due to the addition of new employees throughout 2011, including the positions of Executive Vice President - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President - General Counsel.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	In 2005 we sold an outlet center located in Seymour, Indiana.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	We retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we had sold in recent years.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land in Seymour, IN.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land, we accounted for the land as "held for sale" and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in the 2010 period in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its current fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	We determined the estimated fair value using a market approach considering offers that we obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization increased $6.0 million , or 8% , in the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs increased in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period primarily as a result of the additional centers added to the portfolio during 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The depreciation and amortization from acquisitions includes the amortization of lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of the acquired properties which are amortized over shorter lives.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	In addition, the 2011 period includes a full year of depreciation and amortization related to the Mebane, NC outlet center which opened in November 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	As of March 31, 2010, the previously existing Hilton Head I, SC outlet center was vacant of all tenants in preparation for the demolition and redevelopment of the center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	At that point the depreciable assets of the center had been fully depreciated.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased approximately $11.3 million , or 33.0% , in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $649.6 million for the 2010 period to approximately $870.1 million for the 2011 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of the mortgages assumed as part of the acquisition of four properties, additional funding necessary for the development and acquisition projects described above, the repurchase of 3.0 million preferred shares in December 2010 and other general corporate purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT The 2010 period includes the write-off of approximately $563,000 of unamortized loan origination costs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	These assets were written-off due to the repayment of the $235.0 million term loan facility in the 2010 period with a portion of the proceeds from the $300.0 million unsecured bond offering in June 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	LOSS ON TERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES During the second quarter of 2010, we terminated two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $235.0 million originally entered into in 2008 for the purpose of fixing the LIBOR based interest rate on the $235.0 million term loan facility originally completed in June 2008.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	We paid approximately $6.1 million to terminate the two interest rate swap agreements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The agreements were terminated because the underlying debt for the derivative transaction was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the $300.0 million bond offering mentioned above.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	EQUITY IN LOSSES OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $1.1 million , or 237.3% , in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Losses were higher in the 2011 period due to the increase in interest rates upon the refinancing for the Deer Park mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Even though the loans were refinanced in December 2011, the interest rate increase was effective as of May 2011 when the original loan terms expired.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	In addition, in December 2011 Deer Park Warehouse recorded an impairment charge of approximately $900,000, of which our one-third share is $300,000, to lower the basis of the warehouse to its estimated fair market value.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	The 2010 period included no impairment charges for any unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In May 2010, the Company's Board of Directors approved the plan for our management to sell our Commerce I, Georgia center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The facts and circumstances of the plan met the accounting requirements to classify the results of operations of the center as discontinued operations for the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In the 2010 period the majority of the Commerce I, GA center was sold.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the remaining portion of the center to its approximate fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The remaining portion of the center was sold during the first quarter of 2011, however, the 2011 period did not include any discontinued operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	NET INCOME Net income decreased approximately $29.3 million in the 2010 period to $38.3 million as compared to $67.5 million for the 2009 period.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Net income was affected by an increase of $5.7 million in operating revenues, a $2.8 million decrease in operating expenses, a $1.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a $3.6 million decrease in interest expense.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $ 4.9 million , or 3%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant space.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	In November 2010, we opened our new outlet center in Mebane, NC and during the second quarter of 2009 opened an additional expansion phase at our Commerce II, GA outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, we completed the demolition of one of our two centers in Hilton Head, SC comprising approximately 162,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The redevelopment of this site began during the second quarter of 2010 with the opening of a new 177,000 square foot outlet center during the first quarter of 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Base rentals related to the demolished center of $400,000 and $1.8 million for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively are included in the "Base rentals from new developments" line item above.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Also, included in base rentals is the amortization from the value of the above and below market leases recorded as a result of our property acquisitions as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	At December 31, 2010, the net liability representing the amount of unrecognized combined above and below market lease values totaled approximately $1.5 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	PERCENTAGE RENTALS Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels, increased $1.1 million, or 16% from the 2009 period to the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in percentage rentals are directly related to the strength of our tenants' sales.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our wholly owned properties for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 6.6% to $354 per square foot.

1004036_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements from 2009 to 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In November 2010, we opened our new outlet center in Mebane, NC and during the second quarter of 2009 opened an additional expansion phase at our Commerce II, GA outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Expense reimbursements from the redevelopment of Hilton Head I, SC center of $115,000 and $918,000 for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively, are included in the "Expense reimbursements from new developments" line item above.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	OTHER INCOME Other income decreased $2.5 million, or 22%, in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period due primarily to the $3.3 million gain on the sale of a land outparcel at our Washington, Pennsylvania outlet center in August 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	This decrease was partially offset by the incremental other income generated from the opening of the outlet center in Mebane, NC in November 2010 and an increase in Tanger Club memberships and other vending categories.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $5.6 million, or 6%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses from 2009 to 2010 thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The increase in existing property operating expenses is primarily due to increases in snow removal in 2010 due to extreme winter weather in December in the eastern portion of the United States and normal annual increases associated with operating mall offices throughout our portfolio.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses decreased $8.0 million, or 25%, in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Effective September 1, 2009, Stanley K. Tanger, founder of the Company, retired as an employee of the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	His severance, totaling $10.3 million, consisted of a cash payment of $3.4 million and $6.9 million of share-based compensation from the accelerated vesting of restricted common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Excluding this severance, general and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million primarily as a result of additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2010 notional unit plan and increases in other professional and legal fees.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.9 million, or 2%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The majority of the decrease is due to lower levels of intangible lease cost amortization from acquired outlet centers in 2003, 2005 and 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	These decreases were partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.0 million and $6.3 million recognized during the 2010 and 2009 periods, respectively, related to the demolition and redevelopment plan at our Hilton Head I, SC center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	IMPAIRMENT CHARGE In 2005 we sold our outlet center located in Seymour, IN, but retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we had sold in recent years.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land in Seymour, IN.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land for sale, we accounted for the land as "held for sale" and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in our consolidated statements of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its fair value at that time.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	We determined the estimated fair value using a market approach considering offers that we had obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $3.6 million, or 9%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	This decrease was due to the significant reduction in the average amount of debt outstanding through an exchange offering in May 2009 and a common share offering in August 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	These two equity transactions in essence retired approximately $259.1 million of outstanding debt.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The 2010 period includes the write-off of approximately $563,000 of unamortized loan origination costs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	These assets were written-off due to the repayment of the $235.0 million term loan facility in the 2010 period with a portion of the proceeds from the 2020 Notes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	In May 2009, senior exchangeable notes of the Operating Partnership in the principal amount of $142.3 million and a carrying amount of $135.3 million were exchanged for common shares of the Company, representing approximately 95.2% of the total senior exchangeable notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	In the aggregate, the exchange offer resulted in the issuance of approximately 9.7 million common shares and the payment of approximately $1.2 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest and in lieu of fractional shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	Following settlement of the exchange offer, senior exchangeable notes in the principal amount of approximately $7.2 million remained outstanding.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	In connection with the exchange offering, we recognized in income from continuing operations and net income a gain on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $10.5 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	LOSS ON TERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES During the second quarter of 2010, we terminated two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $235.0 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	These agreements were originally entered into in 2008 for the purpose of fixing the LIBOR based interest rate on the $235.0 million term loan facility originally completed in June 2008.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	We paid approximately $6.1 million to terminate the two interest rate swap agreements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The agreements were terminated because the underlying debt for the derivative transaction was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the 2020 Notes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Prior to when they were terminated, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Unrealized gains and losses related to the effective portion of the swaps were recognized in other comprehensive income.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Because the swaps were highly effective, the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income when the swaps were terminated was equal to the amount recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	The contemporaneous termination of the swaps and the related debt caused the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income to be reclassified to earnings.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	Additionally, a payment of $6.1 million, which was considered to be an investing activity in the statement of cash flows, was made to relieve the obligation that was recorded as a liability.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	GAIN ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN ACQUIRED JOINT VENTURE On January 5, 2009, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture for a cash price of $32.0 million and the assumption of the existing mortgage loan of $35.8 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The acquisition was funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	We had owned a 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture since its formation in 2001 and accounted for it under the equity method.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	The joint venture is now 100% owned by us and has been consolidated since January 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	The acquisition was accounted for under the new guidance for acquisitions which was effective January 1, 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	Under this guidance, we recorded a gain of $31.5 million which represented the difference between the fair market value of our previously owned interest and its cost basis.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	EQUITY IN LOSSES OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by $1.0 million, or 69%, in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The improvement is due to the natural expiration of $170.0 million of interest rate swaps at the Deer Park joint venture in June 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The expiration of these swaps enabled the joint venture to incur interest at a variable rate based on a LIBOR index that is currently at historically low levels.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The decrease was offset slightly by higher interest rate levels at our Wisconsin Dells joint venture which refinanced its $24.8 million mortgage loan in December 2009.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	The new mortgage included a credit spread over the LIBOR rate of 3.00% compared to a credit spread of 1.30% in the expiring mortgage.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In May 2010, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan for our management to sell our Commerce I, Georgia center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The facts and circumstances of the plan met the accounting requirements to classify the results of operations of the center as discontinued operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	The majority of the center was sold in July 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	The remaining portion of the center was sold during the first quarter of 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S4	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the remaining portion of the center to its approximate fair value based on the actual sales contracts related to the center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P56_S5	In the 2009 period, we recorded an impairment charge for the Commerce I, GA property of $5.2 million which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its estimated fair value at that time.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in July 2012 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Based on our 2011 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $54.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We distributed approximately $65.8 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	If events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced, we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our REIT status.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Rental and occupancy rates are the primary factors that influence property rental income levels.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period due to incremental cash flow provided by the re-opening of the Hilton Head I, SC outlet center and the outlet centers acquired during 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, the Mebane, NC outlet center was open for a full year in 2011 compared with two months in the 2010 period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	In addition, base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Cash flow used in investing activities was higher in the 2011 period mainly due to the $266.2 million expended for the acquisition of four outlet centers as well as an increase of $25.3 million in additions to unconsolidated joint ventures offset by a $6.1 million cash payment in the 2010 period to terminate certain derivative agreements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following is a summary of the 2011 and 2010 financing transactions:
1004036_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	In July 2011, the Company raised approximately $117.4 million in cash through the issuance of 4.6 million common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	The net proceeds from the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 13,000 general partnership common units and 1,137,000 limited partnership common units.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	In August 2011, the remaining outstanding $7.2 million of our senior exchangeable notes were exchanged and 136,360 Company common shares were issued to note holders in addition to the principal repayments.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	In June 2010, the Operating Partnership issued $300.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2020 at a price of 99.310%.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P83_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the redevelopment of our Hilton Head I, SC outlet center and celebrated a grand re-opening on March 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the 177,000 square foot center was 98% occupied.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	In addition, the property features four pad sites, three of which were leased as of December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We have formed joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers that are currently in various stages of development in several markets.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period of other potential developments, including sites located in Scottsdale, AZ, as well as Halton Hills and Ottawa, Ontario.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The Ontario sites, if developed, will be undertaken by our Canadian Joint Venture with our RioCan partner (see discussion under the caption RioCan Canadian Joint Venture in the section title "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements").
1004036_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites in the United States.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	There can be no assurance that any of these sites will be ultimately developed.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we typically use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources previously described.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , 89% of our outstanding debt represented unsecured borrowings and 90% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of November 10, 2015 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	The term loan will be interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, the new loan has an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our $520.0 million unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	In June 2011, the Operating Partnership closed on a $150.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% and used the proceeds from the loan to fund the acquisition of the Jeffersonville, OH outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	In November 2011, the Operating Partnership repaid this bridge loan in conjunction with the recast of its unsecured lines of credit, as discussed below.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	In July 2011, the Company completed a public offering of 4.6 million common shares at a price of $25.662 per share.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting estimated offering expenses, were approximately $117.4 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	Net proceeds from the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 13,000 general partnership common units and 1,137,000 limited partnership common units.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P91_S3	The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under its unsecured lines of credit and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	In association with the acquisitions disclosed in the "General Overview", the Operating Partnership assumed mortgage debt in the amount of $112.7 million , including total fair value premiums of $7.8 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	On November 10, 2011, the Operating Partnership amended its $400.0 million of unsecured lines of credit, increasing the total capacity to $520.0 million (of which up to $100.0 million may be borrowed in Canadian dollars) and extending the maturity through November 10, 2015 .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line as well as a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	The syndicated line may be increased to $750.0 million through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	We have the option to extend the lines for an additional year to November 10, 2016 .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a credit spread over LIBOR of 1.25% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.25% on the total committed amount.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S4	Previously, the credit spread over LIBOR was 1.90% and the annual facility fee was 0.40% .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P94_S5	The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations under these lines.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	In June 2010, the Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $300.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2020.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The 2020 Notes pay interest semi-annually and were priced at 99.310% of the principal amount to yield 6.219%.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.5 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Notes to (i) repay our $235 million unsecured term loan due in June 2011, (ii) pay approximately $6.1 million to terminate two interest rate swap agreements associated with the term loan, (iii) repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and (iv) for general working capital purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	In November 2010, the Operating Partnership entered into a $385.0 million syndicated, unsecured line of credit.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	In addition, the Operating Partnership simultaneously entered into a $15.0 million cash liquidity line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. providing a total revolving line capacity of $400.0 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	The liquidity line's terms were substantially the same as the syndicated line, including maturity date.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	The syndicated line replaced our previous $325.0 million in bilateral lines of credit that were scheduled to mature between June and August 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	The maturity date of the lines was November 29, 2013, and we had an option to extend the lines for one year.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	At that time, the lines bore interest at a spread over LIBOR of 1.90% and required the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.40% on the total committed amount.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	The redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P98_S5	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our dividend and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	New center development expenditures, which includes first generation tenant allowances, decreased in the 2011 period due primarily to the completion of the Mebane, NC outlet center which opened in November 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Center redevelopment relates to our Hilton Head I, SC outlet center which began in April 2010 and re-opened in March 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Major center renovations in the 2011 period relates to our on-going renovation at our Howell, Michigan outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	For purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2011 was used.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have $1.8 million remaining as of December 31, 2011 related to various construction contracts for capital expenditure projects at centers throughout our portfolio.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Our senior, unsecured notes contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Key financial covenants and their covenant levels include:
1004036_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	(1) For a complete listing of all debt covenants related to our senior unsecured notes, as well as definitions of the above terms, refer to our applicable supplemental indenture filing with the SEC.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	Based on our 2011 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $54.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as de scribed above.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	We distributed approximately $65.8 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P115_S3	If events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced, we may not have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our REIT status.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2011 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Each of the above ventures contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees and other provisions where a venture partner can force the other partners to either buy or sell their investment in the joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	Should this occur, we may be required to sell the property to the venture partner or incur a significant cash outflow in order to maintain ownership of these outlet centers.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	In March 2005, we established the 50/50 Wisconsin Dells joint venture to construct and operate a Tanger Outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, WI.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	In December 2009, the joint venture extended its interest-only mortgage loan totaling $25.3 million to December 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	The modified loan refinanced the original construction loan and bears interest based on the LIBOR index plus 3.00%.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	The loan incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well a limited joint and several guarantee which in total is limited to interest costs plus 50% of the principal.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P118_S4	The loan currently has a balance of $24.3 million.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	In October 2003, we and two other members each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, NY.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	The center, which contains approximately 657,000 square feet, opened in October 2008.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	On December 22, 2011, Deer Park closed on the refinancing of its mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	At the closing, Deer Park made a payment of $20.0 million towards the principal amount of the mortgage bringing the new balance outstanding to $231.9 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	The principal balance on the mezzanine loan remained at $15.0 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S3	The new interest rates for the mortgage and mezzanine loan are LIBOR plus 3.50% and LIBOR plus 5.00% , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S4	Each of the three partners made an equity contribution to Deer Park prior to closing of $6.4 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S5	The $20.0 million principal payment was made from a combination of these three equity contributions totaling $19.2 million and cash available within Deer Park.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S6	The maturity date of both the mortgage and the mezzanine loan is May 17, 2014 , however additional principal payments may be required prior to maturity if certain financial covenants are not met.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P120_S7	Such principal payments, if necessary, may require additional capital contributions to Deer Park by the partners.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	In June 2008 , we, along with our partners in Deer Park, entered into a joint venture to purchase a 29,000 square foot warehouse adjacent to the Deer Park project described above for a total purchase price of $3.3 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	Deer Park Warehouse, in which we have a 33.3% ownership interest, is an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	The interest-only mortgage loan for the warehouse matured on May 17, 2011 and the joint venture did not qualify for the one-year extension option.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	As a result, the joint venture has accrued interest at a default rate of 8.25% from May 17, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and is currently in negotiations with the lender.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P121_S4	There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these negotiations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal balance under the warehouse mortgage was $2.3 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	In December 2011, the joint venture recorded an impairment charge of approximately $900,000 to lower the basis of the warehouse to its estimated fair market value.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	In June 2011 , we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Simon Property Group, Inc. for the development of a Tanger Outlet Center south of Houston in Texas City, TX.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	When completed, we expect that the center will feature over 90 brand name and designer outlet stores in the first phase which will contain approximately 350,000 square feet, with room to expand to approximately 470,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	In July 2011 , the joint venture acquired the land underlying the site for approximately $5.6 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S3	Ground breaking ceremonies were held on August 30, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we have contributed $7.8 million in cash to the joint venture to fund development activities.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P123_S5	We will provide property management and marketing services to the center and with our partners, will jointly provide development and leasing services.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	During 2011 we announced the formation of an exclusive joint venture with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Through December 31, 2011, we have contributed approximately $1.0 million to fund pre-development and due diligence costs for various sites.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	Any projects developed will be co-owned by us and RioCan on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P124_S3	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P124_S4	It is the intention of the joint venture to develop as many as 10 to 12 outlet centers in larger urban markets and tourist areas across Canada, over a five to seven year period.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	The typical size of a Tanger Outlet Center is approximately 350,000 square feet depending on the individual market and tenant demand.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	Assuming these parameters are suitable and materialize in Canada, the overall investment of the joint venture is anticipated to be as high as $1.0 billion, on a fully built out basis.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	There can be no assurance that the current plans of the joint venture to develop outlet centers in Canada as described above will be fully realized.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	On December 9, 2011 , the Canadian Joint Venture purchased the Cookstown Outlet Mall for $47.4 million , plus an additional $13.8 million for excess land upon the seller meeting certain conditions, for an aggregate purchase price of $61.2 million .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	RioCan will provide development and property management services to this existing outlet center and we will provide leasing and marketing services.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	In connection with the purchase, the joint venture assumed the in place financing of $29.6 million which carries an interest rate of 5.1% and matures in 2014.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Cookstown Outlet Mall is north of the Greater Toronto Area in Innisfil, Ontario, and contains approximately 159,000 square feet with the potential to expand to approximately 320,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	This outlet center features many national retailers such as, Coach Outlet, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger Outlet, Puma and Rockport.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	The acquisition of this property will enable the Canadian Joint Venture to begin to implement its outlet center strategy immediately, as well as provide the flexibility to potentially expand the site into a full-scale Tanger Outlet Center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	In May 2011 , we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture agreement with The Peterson Companies for the development of Tanger Outlets at National Harbor in the Washington, D.C. area.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	National Harbor includes fine restaurants, distinctive retail, office and residences, and a number of world-class hotels including the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	Developed by The Peterson Companies, National Harbor comprises 350 acres of prime real estate along the scenic Potomac River in Prince George's County, MD.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S2	It is anticipated that the joint venture will develop an approximately 40 acre parcel at National Harbor offering easy access to I-495, I-95, I-295 and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S3	The resulting Tanger Outlet Center is expected to house approximately 80 outlet designer and name brand stores in a center measuring up to 350,000 square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S4	In December 2011, both parties each made initial equity contributions of $850,000 to fund certain pre-development costs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S5	We will provide property management, leasing and marketing services to the joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P129_S6	We and The Peterson Companies will jointly provide site development and construction supervision services to the joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	In February 2012, we announced plans to begin construction on Tanger Outlets Westgate, our previously announced site in Glendale, AZ.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	Currently, we expect the outlet center to contain approximately 328,000 square feet and to be open in time for the 2012 holiday shopping season.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table details our share of the debt maturities of the unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Management, leasing and marketing fees we received for services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, transferred his general partnership interest in the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, to the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S1	As discussed in Note 2, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership was the noncontrolling interest in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S2	The sole trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust, and thus effectively the general partner of Tanger Family Limited Partnership, was John H. Vernon.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S3	Mr. Vernon is a partner at the law firm of Vernon, Vernon, Wooten, Brown, Andrews Garrett, or the Vernon Law Firm, which has served as the principal outside counsel of the Company and Operating Partnership since their inception in 1993.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S4	Based on Mr. Vernon's position as trustee of the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust, the general partner of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, he was considered a related party until the dissolution of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership on June 1, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P133_S5	However, Mr. Vernon had neither ownership rights nor economic interests in either the Tanger Family Limited Partnership or the Stanley K. Tanger Marital Trust while he served as trustee.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Fees paid to the Vernon Law Firm were approximately $1,617,000 , $1,144,000 and $851,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	As of December 31, 2010, no amounts were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses for the Vernon Law Firm.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P134_S2	Effective June 1, 2011, upon dissolution of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, Mr. Vernon was no longer considered a related party.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Tanger Family Limited Partnership received quarterly distributions of earnings totaling $4.8 million , $9.4 million and $9.3 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	On June 1, 2011, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership was dissolved in connection with the settling of the estate of Stanley K. Tanger.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	Upon dissolution of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership, the units of the Operating Partnership owned by the Tanger Family Limited Partnership were distributed to the Family Limited Partners, who are primarily the descendants of Stanley Tanger (including Steven Tanger, the Company's Chief Executive Officer), their spouses or former spouses or their children and/or trusts for their benefit.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P135_S3	Each such individual beneficial owner is now an individual limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and each has the ability to exchange their Operating Partnership units for the Company's common shares in the ratio of one Operating Partnership unit for four Company common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P135_S4	During 2011, 160,332 Operating Partnership units were exchanged by a Family Limited Partner for 641,328 Company common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P137_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P139_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P139_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process, to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P139_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P141_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P141_S3	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P141_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	We capitalize all incremental, direct fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases as deferred charges.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P144_S1	We amortize these costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term of five years.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P144_S2	We capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest costs, once the development becomes probable.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P146_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P146_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P146_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P147_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P151_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P151_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P151_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that amends measurement and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to improve consistency with International Financial Reporting Standards.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	The guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P152_S2	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders' equity and requires all nonowner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	The guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	Funds from Operations represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P155_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P157_S2	In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only supplementally.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	(3) Includes the dilutive effect of options and exchangeable notes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	(4) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	We present Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P163_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	In addition, we use AFFO, or some form of AFFO, when certain material, unplanned transactions occur, as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P167_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only supplementally.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options and exchangeable notes.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	(3) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	Same Center Net Operating Income We present Same Center Net Operating Income ( NOI ) as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	We define NOI as total operating revenues less property operating expenses.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S2	Same Center NOI represents the NOI for the stabilized properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, expanded, renovated or subject to a material, non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S3	We believe that NOI and Same Center NOI provide useful information to our investors and analysts about our financial and operating performance because it provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S4	Because Same Center NOI excludes the change in NOI from properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and disposed of, it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P170_S5	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	Same Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of the Company's entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other nonproperty income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties that could materially impact the Company's results from operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Below is a reconciliation of income before equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations to same center net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2011 , and 2010 (in thousands):
1004036_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P174_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P174_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	During 2011, approximately 1.8 million square feet, or 18%, of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.6 million or 15%, of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S2	During 2011, we renewed 82% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 13% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S3	We also re-tenanted 548,000 square feet at a 50% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P177_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P178_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 8.0% of our square feet or 6.5% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P178_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_12_ITEM7_P178_S4	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 99% and 98%.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we were not a party to any interest rate protection agreements.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , 35% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $3.6 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, exchangeable notes, unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.1 billion and $770.1 million , respectively, and its recorded value was $1.0 billion and $714.6 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately $37.5 million and $35.4 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger, and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2011 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:

1004036_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

1004036_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.:

1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P64_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P65_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1004036_12_ITEM15_P67_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

1004036_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we owned and operated 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 10.7 million square feet.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	These outlet centers were 99% occupied and contained over 2,300 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in three outlet centers totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet, including one outlet center in Ontario, Canada.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S4	We own the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S5	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S6	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S7	Through May 31, 2011, the Tanger family, through its ownership of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership held the remaining units as a limited partner.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S8	On June 1, 2011, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership was dissolved, and the units of the Operating Partnership owned by the Tanger Family Limited Partnership were distributed to the individual Family Limited Partners.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P79_S9	Each such Family Limited Partner is now an individual limited partner of the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Family Limited Partners").
1004036_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , our wholly-owned subsidiaries owned 21,681,914 units of the Operating Partnership and the Family Limited Partners collectively owned the remaining 2,872,973 units.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	Each unit held by the Family Limited Partners is exchangeable for four of our common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve our status as a REIT.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	We evaluate our real estate joint ventures in accordance with the Consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC").
1004036_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that our Deer Park Joint Venture is a VIE and all of our other joint ventures are not VIE's.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	Deer Park is considered a VIE because it does not meet the criteria of the members having a sufficient equity investment at risk.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	After making the determination that Deer Park was a VIE, we performed an assessment to determine if we would be considered the primary beneficiary and thus be required to consolidate Deer Park's balance sheets and results of operations.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	This assessment was based upon whether we had the following:
1004036_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Based on the provisions of the operating and management agreements of Deer Park, we determined that no one member alone has the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of Deer Park.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	We have determined that all three partners share power in the decisions that most significantly impact Deer Park, as well as the financial rights and obligations, and therefore we are not required to consolidate Deer Park.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	Our equity method investment in Deer Park as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $5.4 million .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and based on the future operating performance of Deer Park.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	See Note 4 for further discussion of Deer Park.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Family Limited Partners' percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units (prior to June 1, 2011, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership's percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units) and Noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships reflects the interests in consolidated partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interest.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	Operating Segments - We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including certain overhead costs, are capitalized.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	The amount of overhead costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P90_S3	Direct costs to acquire existing centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and seven years for equipment.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as landscaping and infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	Interest costs capitalized during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $393,000 , $1.5 million and $300,000 , respectively, and internal development costs capitalized amounted to $1.4 million , $1.5 million and $1.5 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $66.2 million , $64.5 million and $64.5 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $551,000 and $550,000 , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the average minimum lease term of 5 years.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including internal lease costs and amounts paid to third-party brokers, during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were approximately $10.7 million , $6.1 million and $4.3 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P100_S3	See Rental Property above for a discussion.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	Captive Insurance - Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northline Indemnity, LLC, is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	We recognized impairment losses of $846,000 and $5.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P104_S2	We believe there are no unrecorded impairment losses as of December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Real estate assets designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	We classify real estate as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P105_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P105_S3	The operating results of real estate assets designated as held for sale and for assets sold are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our results of operations.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P109_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P110_S6	The tax years 2008 - 2011 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	In November 2005, we issued 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares (liquidation preference $25.00 per share).
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	In 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $1.88 per share, of which $1.85 was treated as ordinary income and $0.03 of which was treated as a capital gain distribution.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S2	We paid preferred cash dividends per share of $2.07 in 2010 all of which was treated as ordinary income.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S3	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S4	The redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P111_S5	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	Dividends per share were taxable as follows:
1004036_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 :
1004036_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded in other assets were approximately $20.8 million and $16.7 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P116_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P116_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P116_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P116_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	We provide management, leasing and development services for a fee for certain properties that we partially own through a joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Fees received for these services are recognized as other income when earned.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P120_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2011 , 2010 or 2009 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	The Riverhead, NY outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenues.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	The Riverhead outlet center, originally constructed in 1994 and containing 729,736 square feet as of December 31, 2011 , represented approximately 11% and 12% of our consolidated total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P121_S2	The Atlantic City, NJ outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P121_S3	The Atlantic City outlet center, acquired during 2011 and containing 489,762 square feet as of December 31, 2011 , represented 10% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	Expenditures included in construction trade payables as of December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 amounted to $13.7 million , $31.8 million and $14.2 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	Interest paid, net of interest capitalized, in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $45.4 million , $37.6 million and $36.0 million , respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Non-cash Financing Activities - Non-cash financing activities that occurred during the 2011 period included the assumption of mortgage debt in the amount of $112.7 million , including total net premiums of $7.8 million related to the acquisitions described in Note 4.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Non-cash financing activities that occurred during the 2009 period included the assumption of mortgage debt in the amount of $35.8 million , including a discount of $1.5 million related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 joint venture.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P124_S1	In addition, rental property increased by $32.0 million related to the fair market valuation of our previously held interest in excess of carrying amount.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	We also completed a non-cash exchange offer in 2009 which resulted in the retirement of $142.3 million in principal amount of exchangeable notes which had a carrying value of $135.3 million .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P125_S1	These notes were retired concurrent with the issuance of approximately 9.7 million common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	In August 2009, we closed on the sale of an outparcel of land at our property in Washington, PA.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	A non-cash condition of the sale was the assumption by the buyer of approximately $2.6 million of the tax increment financing liability associated with the property.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We may issue non-qualified options and other equity-based awards under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan, or the Incentive Award Plan.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P127_S1	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that amends measurement and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to improve consistency with International Financial Reporting Standards.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	The guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P128_S2	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders' equity and requires all nonowner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	The guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the redevelopment of our Hilton Head I outlet center and celebrated a grand re-opening on March 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the 177,000 square foot center was 98% occupied.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	In addition, the property features four pad sites, three of which were leased as of December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Commitments to complete construction of our redevelopment and other capital expenditure requirements amounted to approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	Commitments for construction represent only those costs contractually required to be paid by us.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	In 2005, we sold our outlet center located in Seymour, IN but retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we sold in recent years.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land, we accounted for the land as "held for sale" and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P133_S3	We determined the fair value using a market approach considering offers that we obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P133_S4	See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	Two of the outparcels were sold during the first half of 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $200,000 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	In the second quarter 2009, we recorded a $5.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to our Commerce I, GA outlet center in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value at that time.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	We determined the fair value in 2009 using a market approach whereby we considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved the plan for our management to sell the outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	The majority of the center was sold in July 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $1.4 million .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the center to its approximate fair value based on the actual sales contracts related the center.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P136_S3	The remaining portion of the center, classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 , was sold at the end of January 2011 for net proceeds of approximately $724,000 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P136_S4	There was no gain or loss on the sale as the impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 reduced the basis in the remaining property to its approximate fair value.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	During 2009, we obtained approval from Beaufort County, SC to implement a redevelopment plan at the Hilton Head I, SC outlet center.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	Based on the redevelopment timeline, we intended to demolish the existing buildings during the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	Therefore, we changed the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets to end at the date the center was expected to be vacant in preparation for demolition.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	As a result of this change in useful lives, additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.0 million and $6.3 million was recognized during the 2010 and 2009 period, respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S4	The accelerated depreciation and amortization reduced income from continuing operations and net income by approximately $0.10 and $0.08 per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P137_S5	Once the demolition was completed during the second quarter of 2010, the fully depreciated assets were written-off.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 aggregated $28.5 million and $6.4 million respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	We have evaluated the accounting treatment for each of the joint ventures and have concluded based on the current facts and circumstances that the equity method of accounting should be used to account for the individual joint ventures.

1004036_12_ITEM15_P190_S1	At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , the ownership interests of the Operating Partnership consisted of the following:
1004036_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Family Limited Partners as discussed in Note 1.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	Family Limited Partners are holders of Operating Partnership units that may be exchanged for Company common shares in a ratio of one unit for four Company common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 (in thousands, except per share amounts).
1004036_12_ITEM15_P194_S1	Note that per share amounts reflect a two-for-one split of the Company's common shares in January 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per share computation, if the effect was dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of our common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per share.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	There were no outstanding senior, exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2011.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P198_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, 183,500 options were excluded from the computation.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P198_S2	No options were excluded from the computation for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P198_S3	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the noncontrolling interest limited partners as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company's unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P199_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 (in thousands, except per unit amounts):
1004036_12_ITEM15_P201_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon exercise of options or issuance of restricted share awards, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding unit to the Company for every four common shares issued.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per unit computation, if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of the Company's common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per common share.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	There were no outstanding senior, exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2011 .
1004036_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to four times the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P207_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, 45,875 options were excluded from the computation.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P207_S2	No options were excluded from the computation for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	The Company's unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P208_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	We have a shareholder approved share-based compensation plan, the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P209_S1	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P209_S2	Through December 31, 2011 , we had granted 7,345,460 options, net of options forfeited, and 2,774,820 restricted share awards, net of restricted shares forfeited, and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 1,176,000 common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P209_S3	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 4,103,720 common shares.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P209_S4	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan are determined by the Share and Unit Option Committee of the Board of Directors.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P210_S0	In February 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 191,500 options to non-executive employees of the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P210_S1	The exercise price of the options granted during the first quarter of 2011 is $26.06 which equaled the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P210_S2	The options expire ten years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P210_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the 2011 grant: expected dividend yield 3.0% ; expected life of 7 years; expected volatility of 32.8% ; a risk-free rate of 2.9% ; and forfeiture rates of 3.0% to 20.0% dependent upon the employee's position within the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P211_S0	During 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , the Board of Directors approved the grant of 329,000 , 312,750 and 415,000 restricted shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P211_S1	The independent directors' restricted shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P211_S2	For all of the restricted awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the market price of our common shares on the date of grant and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	Also, during the first quarter of 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee Approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, (the "2010 Multi Year Performance Plan").
1004036_12_ITEM15_P212_S1	Under the 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, we granted 392,000 notional units, net of notional units forfeited, to award recipients as a group.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P213_S0	If the Company's aggregate share price appreciation during the four year period beginning January 1, 2010 equals or exceeds the minimum threshold of 40%, then the notional units will convert into the Company's restricted common shares on a one-for- one basis.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P213_S1	The notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for- two basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the target threshold of 50% and on a one-for- three basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the maximum of 60%.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P213_S2	The notional amounts will convert on a pro-rata basis between share price appreciation thresholds.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P213_S3	The share price targets will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period, subject to a minimum level price target.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P213_S4	For notional amounts granted in 2010, any shares earned on December 31, 2013 will vest on December 31, 2014 contingent on continued employment through the vesting date.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P214_S0	The notional units, prior to the date they are converted into restricted common shares, will not entitle award recipients to receive any dividends or other distributions.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P214_S1	If the notional units are earned, and thereby converted into restricted common shares, then award recipients will be entitled to receive a payment of all dividends and other distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned common shares been issued at the beginning of the performance period.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P214_S2	Thereafter, dividends and other distributions will be paid currently with respect to all restricted common shares that were earned.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	At the end of the four-year performance period, if the minimum share price threshold is not achieved but the Company's share performance exceeds the 50th percentile of the share performance of its peer group, the notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for- one basis.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P215_S1	All determinations, interpretations and assumptions relating to the vesting and calculation of the performance awards will be made by the Company's Compensation Committee.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	We recorded share based compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, as follows (in thousands):

1004036_12_ITEM15_P218_S2	Additionally, the Board approved a modification to Mr. Tanger's restricted share agreements whereas, upon his retirement, 432,000 unvested restricted common shares previously granted to Mr. Tanger vested.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P218_S3	As a result of this vesting, we recorded $6.9 million in incremental share-based compensation expense.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P218_S4	Mr. Tanger's severance costs are included in the general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year-ended December 31, 2009.

1004036_12_ITEM15_P225_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P226_S0	As discussed in Note 16, the Operating Partnership and the Company have a joint plan whereby equity based and performance based awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P227_S0	When shares are issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues corresponding units to the Company based on the current exchange ratio as provided by the Operating Partnership agreement.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P227_S1	Based on the current exchange ratio, each unit in the Operating Partnership is equivalent to four common shares of the Company.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P227_S2	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_12_ITEM15_P227_S3	The maximum units that may be issued to the Company due to equity awards granted by the Company are limited by the Plan to 15.4 million of the Company's common shares, or in terms of units, 3,850,000 units.

1004036_13_ITEM1_P15_S4	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we typically use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The term loan is interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, the loan has an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our $520.0 million unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Effective January 1, 2013, Jack Africk, a board member since 1993, resigned his position as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors but remains Chairman Emeritus and an active member of the Board of Directors.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Also effective January 1, 2013, William G. Benton, who has also been a member of our Board since 1993, replaced Mr. Africk as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Thomas J. Reddin, a board member since 2010, replaced Mr. Benton as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Outlets are stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, which enhance their profit potential.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Outlet centers enable them to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Each of our outlet centers carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have developed long-standing relationships with many of our tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Because of our established relationships, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,734 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have a diverse tenant base comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach Leatherware, Eddie Bauer, GAP, J. Crew, Juicy, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand Jeans, Michael Kors, Nike, Old Navy, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue - Off Fifth, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour and others.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , no single tenant accounted for more than 7.9% of our leasable square feet or 6.4% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	Because our typical tenant is a large, national manufacturer, we generally do not experience any material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 90% of our total revenues in 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues in 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with approximately 400 brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 32 years.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our consolidated outlet centers were 99% occupied with average tenant sales of $376 per square foot.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing centers, renovating and expanding our mature centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	Future centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe our 32 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	We typically prefer that at least 50% of the space in each center is pre-leased prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may occasionally proceed with construction with less than 50% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	This pre-leasing policy is consistent with our conservative financing perspective and the discipline we impose upon ourselves.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to the opening of the first tenant stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Keeping our shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a remerchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	The long-standing retailer relationships that we enjoy allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	In order for our centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, website, internet advertising, social networks, smart phone applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new center.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls and full- and off-price retailers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	Traditional full- and off-price retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers be located not less than 10 miles from the nearest major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	For this reason, our centers compete only to a very limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to minimize the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina in which our corporate headquarters is located.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition, we rent a regional office in New York City, New York to better service our principal fashion-related tenants, many of whom are based in and around that area.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	We maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 38 centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease agreement with us.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	As of February 1, 2013, we had 265 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in New York and 38 business offices.
1004036_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	At that date, we also employed 277 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Such bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders interests.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We own partial interests in seven outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of war and earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	High fuel prices may impact consumer travel and spending habits.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Most shoppers use private automobile transportation to travel to our outlet centers and many of our centers are not easily accessible by public transportation.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Increasing fuel costs may reduce the number of trips to our centers thus reducing the amount spent at our centers.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Many of our outlet center locations near tourist destinations may experience an even more acute reduction of shoppers if there were a reduction of people opting to drive to vacation destinations.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Such reductions in traffic could adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Increasing fuel costs may also reduce disposable income and decrease demand for retail products.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such a decrease could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at current rental rates.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We use such systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and to serve our customers timely.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.
1004036_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	As a result, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_13_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2013, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers totaling 10.7 million square feet located in 24 states.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in seven other outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including three outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our centers range in size from 24,619 to 729,734 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	No one property represents 10% or more of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 or 10% or more of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring centers, developing new centers and expanding existing centers.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of the 36 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 30 and have ground leases on six.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the six centers are located:
1004036_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable center.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P9_S0	(1) Excludes a 29,253 square foot warehouse adjacent to the shopping center.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P9_S1	(2) Center acquired in November 2012, located in Quebec, Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P9_S2	(3) Center acquired in December 2011 and located in Ontario, Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P10_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2013, scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P11_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 560,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P11_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2013 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P11_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P12_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P13_S0	(1) Represents the percentage of total square footage at the beginning of each year that is scheduled to expire during the respective year.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P14_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P15_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P15_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P16_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for our consolidated outlet centers with respect to our ten largest tenants and their store concepts as of February 1, 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P17_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and have not been finally adjudicated.
1004036_13_ITEM2_P17_S1	In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1004036_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF TANGER FACTORY OUTLET CENTERS, INC.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2012 restricted share grant to directors and certain officers of the Company and share-based compensation granted to Steven B. Tanger in February 2012 pursuant to an amendment to his employment contract.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, the 2012 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2011 period due to the addition of new employees since January 1, 2011.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs increased in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period primarily as a result of the additional centers added to the portfolio during 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The depreciation and amortization from acquisitions includes the amortization of lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of the acquired properties which are amortized over shorter lives.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Depreciation and amortization from existing properties decreased as certain construction and development related assets and lease related intangible assets from these properties became fully depreciated during 2012.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was the increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $870.1 million for the 2011 period to approximately $1.1 billion for the 2012 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of the mortgages assumed as part of the acquisition of four properties, additional funding necessary for the development and acquisition projects described above and other general operating purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The increase in interest expense associated with the higher debt outstanding was partially offset by lower interest rates on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	These facilities were recast during the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting in the credit spread over LIBOR being reduced from 190 basis points to 125 basis points.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, in February 2012, we entered into a term loan for $250.0 million with an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in loss is due primarily to acquisition costs and abandoned due diligence costs incurred by our RioCan joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The remaining increase in losses is attributable to joint ventures added during the year which in aggregate have depreciation in excess of their earnings before depreciation.

1004036_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The depreciation and amortization from acquisitions includes the amortization of lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of the acquired properties which are amortized over shorter lives.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, the 2011 period includes a full year of depreciation and amortization related to the Mebane, North Carolina outlet center which opened in November 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of March 31, 2010, the previously existing Hilton Head I, South Carolina outlet center was vacant of all tenants in preparation for the demolition and redevelopment of the center.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	At that point the depreciable assets of the center had been fully depreciated.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased approximately $11.3 million, or 33.0%, in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $649.6 million for the 2010 period to approximately $870.1 million for the 2011 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of the mortgages assumed as part of the acquisition of four properties, additional funding necessary for the development and acquisition projects described above, the repurchase of 3.0 million preferred shares in December 2010 and other general corporate purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT The 2010 period includes the write-off of approximately $563,000 of unamortized loan origination costs.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	These assets were written-off due to the repayment of the $235.0 million term loan facility in the 2010 period with a portion of the proceeds from the $300.0 million unsecured bond offering in June 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	LOSS ON TERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES During the second quarter of 2010, we terminated two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $235.0 million originally entered into in 2008 for the purpose of fixing the LIBOR based interest rate on the $235.0 million term loan facility originally completed in June 2008.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We paid approximately $6.1 million to terminate the two interest rate swap agreements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The agreements were terminated because the underlying debt for the derivative transaction was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the $300.0 million bond offering mentioned above.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	EQUITY IN LOSSES OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $1.1 million, or 237.3%, in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Losses were higher in the 2011 period due to the increase in interest rates upon the refinancing for the Deer Park mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Even though the loans were refinanced in December 2011, the interest rate increase was effective as of May 2011 when the original loan terms expired.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	In addition, in December 2011 Deer Park Warehouse recorded an impairment charge of approximately $900,000, of which our one-third share is $300,000, to lower the basis of the warehouse to its estimated fair market value.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The 2010 period included no impairment charges for any unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In May 2010, the Company's Board of Directors approved the plan for our management to sell our Commerce I, Georgia center.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	The facts and circumstances of the plan met the accounting requirements to classify the results of operations of the center as discontinued operations for the 2010 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	In the 2010 period the majority of the Commerce I, Georgia center was sold.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the remaining portion of the center to its approximate fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	The remaining portion of the center was sold during the first quarter of 2011, however, the 2011 period did not include any discontinued operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2015 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Based on our 2012 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $59.0 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	We distributed approximately $76.9 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	If events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced, we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our REIT status.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the incremental cash flow provided by the addition of the Hilton Head I, South Carolina; Jeffersonville, Ohio; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Ocean City, Maryland; and Hershey, Pennsylvania; centers to our portfolio throughout 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Cash flow used in investing activities was higher in the 2011 period compared to the 2012 period due primarily to the $266.2 million spent in 2011 to acquire the outlet centers in Jeffersonville, Ohio; Atlantic City, New Jersey: Ocean City, Maryland; and Hershey, Pennsylvania.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The 2011 period also included approximately $9.6 million of capital expenditures for the completion of the redevelopment of the Hilton Head I, South Carolina outlet center which opened in March 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The investing activities in the 2012 period were primarily related to additional investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, including $54.3 million invested in our RioCan joint venture to acquire the Bromont, Quebec and Saint-Sauveur, Quebec properties in November 2012 and to retire mortgage debt associated with the Cookstown, Ontario property in March 2012, $19.4 million to fund construction activities at the Tanger outlet center in Glendale, Arizona and $27.5 million to fund construction activities at the Tanger outlet center in Texas City, Texas.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Cash provided by financing activities was higher in the 2011 period than the 2012 period due to the amounts required to fund the $266.2 million in acquisitions during 2011 as described above.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	For the 2012 period, dividends and distributions paid to shareholders and unitholders of $81.8 million, up $5.8 million from the 2011 period, exceeded other sources and uses of cash required by our development activities and generated by our operating activities by $15.3 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The following is a summary of the 2012 and 2011 financing transactions:
1004036_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	On February 24, 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The term loan is interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in February of 2015.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, the loan has an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	In June 2011, the Operating Partnership closed on a $150.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% and used the proceeds from the loan to fund the acquisition of the Jeffersonville, Ohio outlet center.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	In November 2011, the Operating Partnership repaid this bridge loan in conjunction with the recast of its unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	In July 2011, the Company raised approximately $117.4 million in cash through the issuance of 4.6 million common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The net proceeds from the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 13,000 general partnership common units and 1,137,000 limited partnership common units.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	In August 2011, the remaining outstanding $7.2 million of our senior exchangeable notes were exchanged and 136,360 Company common shares were issued to note holders in addition to the principal repayments.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P75_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have formed joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers that are currently in various stages of development in several markets.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments, including sites located in Charlotte, North Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut; Scottsdale, Arizona; Toronto, Ontario and Ottawa, Ontario.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Charlotte and Columbus sites, if developed, will be undertaken by joint ventures formed with Simon Properties Group.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	The Ottawa and Toronto sites, if developed, will be undertaken by our RioCan joint venture (see discussion under the caption "RioCan Canadian Joint Venture" in the section titled "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements").
1004036_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , 90% of our outstanding debt represented unsecured borrowings and 90% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1.25%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of November 10, 2015 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The term loan will be interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, the loan has an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our $520.0 million unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	In June 2011, the Operating Partnership closed on a $150.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% and used the proceeds from the loan to fund the acquisition of the Jeffersonville, Ohio outlet center.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	In November 2011, the Operating Partnership repaid this bridge loan in conjunction with the recast of its unsecured lines of credit, as discussed below.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	In July 2011, the Company completed a public offering of 4.6 million common shares at a price of $25.662 per share.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting estimated offering expenses, were approximately $117.4 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Net proceeds from the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 13,000 general partnership common units and 1,137,000 limited partnership common units.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under its unsecured lines of credit and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	In association with the acquisitions disclosed in the "General Overview", the Operating Partnership assumed mortgage debt in the amount of $112.7 million, including total fair value premiums of $7.8 million .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	In November, 2011, the Operating Partnership amended its $400.0 million of unsecured lines of credit, increasing the total capacity to $520.0 million (of which up to $100.0 million may be borrowed in Canadian dollars) and extending the maturity through November 10, 2015.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line as well as a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The syndicated line may be increased to $750.0 million through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	We have the option to extend the lines for an additional year to November 10, 2016.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	As of the date of this filing, based on the Operating Partnership's long-term debt rating, the lines bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1.25% and require the payment of an annual facility fee of 0.25% on the total committed amount.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	Previously, the credit spread over LIBOR was 1.90% and the annual facility fee was 0.40%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations under these lines.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our dividend and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	New center development expenditures, which includes first generation tenant allowances, included expansions to our centers in Gonzales, Louisiana and Locust Grove, Georgia in the 2012 period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The 2011 period included our new center in Mebane, North Carolina, and expansions to our centers in Charleston, South Carolina and Locust Grove, Georgia.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Center redevelopment relates to our Hilton Head I, South Carolina center which re-opened in March 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Major center renovations increased in the 2012 period due to our on-going renovation efforts at the centers acquired during the second and third quarters of 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2012 was used.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have $5.9 million remaining as of December 31, 2012 related to various construction contracts for capital expenditure projects at centers throughout our portfolio.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $8.4 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed because the tenant is not currently open.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Our senior, unsecured notes contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	Key financial covenants and their covenant levels include:
1004036_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	(1) For a complete listing of all debt covenants related to our senior unsecured notes, as well as definitions of the above terms, refer to our applicable supplemental indenture filing with the SEC.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	Based on our 2012 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $59.0 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	We distributed approximately $76.9 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2012 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Each of the above joint ventures contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, the joint venture agreements contain other provisions where a venture partner can force the other partners to either buy or sell their investment in the joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	Should this occur, we may be required to sell the property to the venture partner or incur a significant cash outflow in order to maintain ownership of these outlet centers.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	In October 2003, we and two other members each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	The center, which now contains approximately 742,000 square feet, opened in October 2008.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	On December 22, 2011, Deer Park closed on the refinancing of its mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	At the closing, Deer Park made a payment of $20.0 million towards the principal amount of the mortgage bringing the new balance outstanding to $231.9 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	Each of the three partners made an equity contribution to Deer Park prior to closing of $6.4 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	The $20.0 million principal payment was made from a combination of these three equity contributions totaling $19.2 million and cash available within Deer Park.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S4	The principal balance on the mezzanine loan remained at $15.0 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S5	The new interest rates for the mortgage and mezzanine loan are LIBOR + 3.50% and LIBOR + 5.00%, respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S6	The maturity date of both the mortgage and the mezzanine loan is May 17, 2014, however the loans require certain financial covenants, such as debt service coverage and loan to value ratios, to be met at various measurement dates.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S7	Based on the calculation of its debt service coverage, which is based on information as of December 31, 2012, Deer Park was not in compliance with its coverage requirements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S8	As a result, the lenders have the right, but not the obligation to require a principal payment in an amount sufficient to satisfy the debt service coverage test.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P107_S9	Such principal payment, if necessary, may require additional capital contributions to Deer Park by its partners.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	In June 2008 , we, along with our partners in Deer Park, entered into a joint venture to purchase a warehouse adjacent to the Tanger Outlet Center located in Deer Park, New York for a total purchase price of $3.3 million and obtained mortgage financing of $2.3 million .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The interest only mortgage loan secured by the warehouse matured on May 17, 2011 and the joint venture did not qualify for the one year extension option.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	As a result, on June 1, 2012 the joint venture paid down the outstanding principal balance by $500,000 to $1.8 million and entered into a Loan Forbearance Agreement with the lender whereby the lender agreed that it would not enforce its rights under the loan documents until the trigger date of October 1, 2012 unless extended.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	Extension of the trigger date was contingent among other things upon delivering a fully executed contract to sell the property to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	Although the joint venture did not meet all of the requirements for extending the trigger date, it has delivered a fully executed contract to sell the property which has been approved by the lender.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S5	Through closing, the joint venture is committed to make monthly debt service payments at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.85% .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P108_S6	Additional interest accrues at a rate of Prime + 5.5% less the amount paid.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	In June 2011, we announced the formation of a joint venture for the development of a Tanger Outlet Center south of Houston in Texas City, Texas.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The center grand opening occurred on October 19, 2012 and features over 85 brand name and designer outlet stores in the first phase of approximately 353,000 square feet, with room for expansion for a total build out of approximately 470,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we and our partner had each contributed $35.3 million in cash to the joint venture to fund development activities.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P109_S3	We provide property management and marketing services to the center; and with our partner, are jointly providing development and leasing services.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	In May 2011, we announced the formation of a joint venture for the development of a Tanger Outlet Center at National Harbor in the Washington, D.C. Metro area.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	The planned Tanger Outlet Center is expected to contain approximately 80 brand name and designer outlet stores in a center measuring up to 340,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	In November 2012, the joint venture broke ground and began site development.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	Both parties have made initial equity contributions of $2.6 million to fund certain pre-development costs.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	In February 2013, the joint venture executed a term sheet for a three year construction loan with the ability to borrow up to $61.0 million, which carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	The joint venture currently expects to close on the loan by the end of April 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	We have agreed to provide property management, leasing and marketing services to the joint venture, and with our partner, to jointly provide site development and construction supervision services.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	During 2011 we announced the formation of an exclusive joint venture with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust for the acquisition, development and leasing of sites across Canada that are suitable for development or redevelopment as outlet shopping centers similar in concept and design to those within our existing U.S. portfolio.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Any projects developed will be co-owned by us and RioCan on a 50/50 basis and will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services to the venture and RioCan will provide development and property management services.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	There can be no assurance that the current plans of the joint venture to develop outlet centers in Canada as described above will be fully realized.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	In December 2011, the RioCan joint venture purchased the Cookstown Outlet Mall.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The existing outlet center was acquired for $47.4 million, plus an additional $13.8 million for excess land upon the seller meeting certain conditions, for an aggregate purchase price of $61.2 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	In connection with the purchase, the joint venture assumed the in place financing of $29.6 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P113_S3	In March 2012, the joint venture retired the outstanding loan and we contributed an additional $15.1 million to the joint venture to fund our portion of the payment.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	During the first quarter of 2012, the joint venture terminated an option contract to develop a center in Halton Hills, Ontario and accordingly wrote-off capitalized pre-development costs of approximately $1.4 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	In November 2012, the RioCan joint venture acquired two existing outlet centers in the Montreal, Quebec market for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $94.8 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	The purchase price includes the assumption of mortgages totaling $18.7 million at Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur, which carry a weighted average interest rate of 5.7% and mature in 2015 and 2020.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P115_S2	There is no in-place financing associated with the Bromont Outlet Mall acquisition.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur, is located northwest of Montreal adjacent to Highway 15 in the town of Saint-Sauveur, Quebec.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The property was built in 1980 and expanded in 2006, and is approximately 136,000 square feet with the potential to expand to approximately 131,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	This outlet center features many national brands such as, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Reebok, Guess, Jones New York, Naturalizer and Parasuco.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Bromont Outlet Mall, is located east of Montreal near the eastern townships adjacent to Highway 10 in the town of Bromont, Quebec.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	The property was built in 2004 and expanded through 2011, and is approximately 163,000 square feet with the potential to expand to approximately 251,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	This outlet center features many national brands such as, Point Zero, Tommy Hilfiger, Guess, Puma, Mexx, and Urban Planet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Bromont is located at the base of Mont Brome.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	In May 2012, we formed a joint venture for the development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Glendale, Arizona.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	The center grand opening occurred on November 15, 2012 and features over 80 brand name and designer outlet stores in the first phase of approximately 332,000 square feet, with room for expansion for a total build out of approximately 410,000 square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we contributed $19.4 million in cash to the joint venture to fund development activities.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S3	We provide property management, construction supervision, leasing and marketing services to the joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S4	In June 2012, the joint venture closed on a construction loan with the ability to borrow up to $48.3 million, which carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75%.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P119_S5	As of December 31, 2012, the joint venture's balance on the loan was $32.0 million.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	In March 2005 , we established the Wisconsin Dells joint venture to construct and operate a Tanger Outlet Center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	In December 2012, the joint venture closed on the refinance of its $24.3 million mortgage loan.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	The refinanced interest-only, non-recourse mortgage loan has a 10 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 2.25% .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	We are providing property management, leasing and marketing services to the joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table details the debt maturities of the unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Management, leasing and marketing fees we received for services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P127_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P127_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P129_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	We capitalize all incremental, direct fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases as deferred charges.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P132_S1	We amortize these costs to expense over the minimum lease term.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P132_S2	We capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest costs, during the active development period.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P135_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P135_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P139_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance about offsetting assets and liabilities.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	The new disclosures require that entities disclose both gross and net information about recognized financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position, or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement of financial position.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P140_S2	The guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P140_S3	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	In February 2013, FASB issued guidance establishing new requirements for disclosing reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI").
1004036_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Specifically, (1) disclosure is required of the changes in components of AOCI, (2) disclosure is required of the effects on individual line items in net income for each item of AOCI that is reclassified in its entirety to net income, and (3) cross references are required to other disclosures that provide additional details for AOCI items that are not reclassified in their entirety to net income.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	Funds from Operations represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P143_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P143_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only supplementally.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	(3) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	We present Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P151_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	In addition, we use AFFO, or some form of AFFO, when certain material, unplanned transactions occur, as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only supplementally.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	(2) Includes our share of acquisition costs, abandoned development costs and gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	(3) Includes the dilutive effect of options, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P157_S2	(4) Assumes the partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are converted to common shares of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Same Center Net Operating Income We present Same Center Net Operating Income as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	We define Net Operating Income ("NOI") as total operating revenues less property operating expenses.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P159_S1	Same Center NOI represents the NOI for the stabilized properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, expanded, renovated or subject to a material, non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P159_S2	We believe that NOI and Same Center NOI provide useful information to our investors and analysts about our financial and operating performance because it provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P159_S3	Because Same Center NOI excludes the change in NOI from properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and disposed of, it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P159_S4	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	Same Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of the Company's entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties that could materially impact the Company's results from operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	Below is a reconciliation of income before equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations to Same Center NOI for the years ended December 31, 2012 , and 2011 (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	During 2012 , approximately 1.8 million square feet, or 17%, of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.9 million, or 18%, of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2013 .
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	During 2012 , we renewed 85% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 16% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S3	We also re-tenanted 450,000 square feet at a 54% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P166_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P167_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 7.9% of our square feet or 6.3% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P167_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_13_ITEM7_P167_S4	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 99% and 98%, respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we were not a party to any interest rate protection agreements.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , 39% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $4.3 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion , respectively, and its recorded value was $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately $ 34.8 million and $ 37.5 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger, and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2012 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:

1004036_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P72_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we owned and operated 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 10.7 million square feet.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	These outlet centers were 99% occupied and contained over 2,300 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in 7 outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S4	We own the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S5	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S6	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S7	Through May 31, 2011, the Tanger family, through its ownership of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership held the remaining units as a limited partner.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S8	On June 1, 2011, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership was dissolved, and the units of the Operating Partnership owned by the Tanger Family Limited Partnership were distributed to the individual beneficial owners of the Tanger Family Limited Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P88_S9	As a result, each such beneficial owner became an individual limited partner of the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Family Limited Partners").
1004036_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our wholly-owned subsidiaries owned 23,515,346 units of the Operating Partnership and the Family Limited Partners collectively owned the remaining 1,190,466 units.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	Each unit held by the Family Limited Partners is exchangeable for four of our common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve our status as a REIT.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	We evaluate our real estate joint ventures in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC").
1004036_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that our Westgate and Deer Park joint ventures are Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") and all of our other joint ventures are not VIEs.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P91_S2	Westgate is considered a VIE because the voting rights are disproportionate to the economic interests.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P91_S3	Deer Park is considered a VIE because it does not meet the criteria of the members having a sufficient equity investment at risk.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	After making the determination that Westgate and Deer Park were VIEs, we performed an assessment to determine if we would be considered the primary beneficiary and thus be required to consolidate their balance sheets and results of operations.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	This assessment was based upon whether we had the following:
1004036_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	Based on the provisions of the operating, development, leasing, and management agreements of Westgate and Deer Park, we determined that no single member has the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the ventures and therefore, we are not required to consolidate Westgate or Deer Park.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	Our equity method investments in Westgate and Deer Park as of December 31, 2012 were approximately $19.1 million and $3.0 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and are based on the future operating performance of Westgate and Deer Park.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Family Limited Partners' percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units (prior to June 1, 2011, the Tanger Family Limited Partnership's percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interest.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Operating Segments - We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	Costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including certain overhead costs, are capitalized.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	The amount of overhead costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	Direct costs to acquire existing centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P103_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P103_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P103_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P104_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	Interest costs capitalized during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 amounted to approximately $1.2 million , $393,000 and $1.5 million , respectively, and internal development costs capitalized amounted to $1.8 million , $1.4 million and $1.5 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $73.7 million , $66.2 million and $64.5 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P106_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $670,000 and $551,000 , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including internal lease costs and amounts paid to third-party brokers, during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were approximately $5.1 million , $10.7 million and $6.1 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P110_S2	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P110_S3	See Rental Property above for a discussion.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Captive Insurance - Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northline Indemnity, LLC, is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	We recognized no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P114_S2	We believe there are no unrecorded impairment losses as of December 31, 2012 .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	Real estate assets designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	We classify real estate as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P115_S3	The operating results of real estate assets designated as held for sale and for assets sold, which we will not have any significant continuing involvement, are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our results of operations.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P119_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P120_S6	The tax years 2009 - 2012 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	In November 2005, we issued 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares (liquidation preference $25.00 per share).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	We paid preferred cash dividends per share of $2.07 in 2010 all of which was treated as ordinary income.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P121_S2	In December 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5% Class C Cumulative Preferred Shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P121_S3	The redemption price was $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date, for a total redemption price of $25.198 per share.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P121_S4	Total cash paid to redeem the shares, plus accrued dividends, was $75.6 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were taxable as follows:
1004036_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 :
1004036_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded in other assets were approximately $25.1 million and $20.8 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P126_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P126_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	We receive management, leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues (as defined in the management agreement) and are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	Development fees are recognized as revenue when earned over the development period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals, and are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P129_S1	Profits from development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third-party partners' ownership interest.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P129_S2	Profits earned to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P132_S1	Expenditures included in construction trade payables as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 amounted to $7.1 million , $13.7 million and $31.8 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P132_S2	Interest paid, net of interest capitalized, in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $46.8 million , $45.4 million and $37.6 million , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	Non-cash Financing Activities - Non-cash financing activities that occurred during the 2011 period included the assumption of mortgage debt in the amount of $112.7 million , including total net premiums of $7.8 million related to the acquisitions described in Note 5.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We may issue non-qualified options and other equity-based awards under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan (the "Incentive Award Plan").
1004036_13_ITEM15_P134_S1	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements - In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance about offsetting assets and liabilities.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	The new disclosures require that entities disclose both gross and net information about recognized financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position, or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement of financial position.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P135_S2	The guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2013.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P135_S3	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	In February 2013, FASB issued guidance establishing new requirements for disclosing reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI").
1004036_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	Specifically, (1) disclosure is required of the changes in components of AOCI, (2) disclosure is required of the effects on individual line items in net income for each item of AOCI that is reclassified in its entirety to net income, and (3) cross references are required to other disclosures that provide additional details for AOCI items that are not reclassified in their entirety to net income.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P136_S2	The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P136_S3	We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and currently do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the redevelopment of our Hilton Head I outlet center and celebrated a grand re-opening on March 31, 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the 177,000 square foot center was 100% occupied.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	In 2005, we sold our outlet center located in Seymour, Indiana but retained various outparcels of land at the development site, some of which we sold in recent years.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P139_S1	In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved the sale of the remaining parcels of land.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P139_S2	As a result of this Board approval and an approved plan to actively market the land, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $735,000 in our consolidated statement of operations which equaled the excess of the carrying amount of the land over its fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P139_S3	We determined the fair value using a market approach considering offers that we obtained for all the various parcels less estimated closing costs.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P139_S4	Two of the outparcels were sold during the first half of 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $200,000 .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved the plan for our management to sell the Commerce I, Georgia outlet center.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	The majority of the center was sold in July 2010 for net proceeds of approximately $1.4 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P140_S2	During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $111,000 to lower the basis of the center to its approximate fair value based on the actual sales contracts related the center.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P140_S3	The remaining portion of the center was sold at the end of January 2011 for net proceeds of approximately $724,000 .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P140_S4	There was no gain or loss on the sale as the impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 reduced the basis in the remaining property to its approximate fair value.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	During 2009, we obtained approval from Beaufort County, South Carolina to implement a redevelopment plan at the Hilton Head I, South Carolina outlet center.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	Based on the redevelopment timeline, we intended to demolish the existing buildings during the second quarter of 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	Therefore, we changed the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets to end at the date the center was expected to be vacant in preparation for demolition.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S3	As a result of this change in useful lives, additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $9.0 million was recognized during 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S4	The accelerated depreciation and amortization reduced income from continuing operations and net income by approximately $0.10 per share for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P141_S5	Once the demolition was completed during the second quarter of 2010, the fully depreciated assets were written-off.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 aggregated $126.6 million and $28.5 million respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	We have evaluated the accounting treatment for each of the joint ventures and have concluded based on the current facts and circumstances that the equity method of accounting should be used to account for the individual joint ventures.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P142_S2	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , we were members of the following unconsolidated real estate joint ventures:
1004036_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income (loss), cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required by the equity method of accounting as described below.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	The following management, development, leasing and marketing fees were recognized from services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures (in thousands):
1004036_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	Our investments in real estate joint ventures are reduced by the percentage of the profits earned for leasing and development services associated with our ownership interest in each joint venture.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P145_S1	Our carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures differs from our share of the assets reported in the Summary Balance Sheets - Unconsolidated Joint Ventures shown below due to adjustments to the book basis, including intercompany profits on sales of services that are capitalized by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P145_S2	The differences in basis are amortized over the various useful lives of the related assets.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	In October 2003, we, and two other members each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	The center opened in October 2008.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	On December 22, 2011, Deer Park, closed on the refinancing of its mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	At the closing, Deer Park made a payment of $20.0 million towards the principal amount of the mortgage bringing the new balance outstanding to $231.9 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S2	Each of the three partners made an equity contribution to Deer Park prior to closing of $6.4 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S3	The $20.0 million principal payment was made from a combination of these three equity contributions totaling $19.2 million and cash available within Deer Park.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S4	The principal balance on the mezzanine loan remained at $15.0 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S5	The new interest rates for the mortgage and mezzanine loan are LIBOR + 3.50% and LIBOR + 5.00% , respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S6	The maturity date of both the mortgage and the mezzanine loan is May 17, 2014, however the loans require certain financial covenants, such as debt service coverage and loan to value ratios, to be met at various measurement dates.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S7	Based on the calculation of its debt service coverage, which is based on information as of December 31, 2012, Deer Park was not in compliance with its coverage requirements.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S8	As a result, the lenders have the right, but not the obligation to require a principal payment in an amount sufficient to satisfy the debt service coverage test.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P147_S9	Such principal payment, if necessary, may require additional capital contributions to Deer Park by its partners.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	In June 2008, we, along with our partners in Deer Park, entered into a joint venture to purchase a warehouse adjacent to the Tanger Outlet Center located in Deer Park, New York for a total purchase price of $3.3 million and obtained mortgage financing of $2.3 million .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	The interest only mortgage loan secured by the warehouse matured on May 17, 2011 and the joint venture did not qualify for the one year extension option.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	As a result, on June 1, 2012 the joint venture reduced the outstanding principal balance by $500,000 to $1.8 million and entered into a Loan Forbearance Agreement with the lender whereby the lender agreed that it would not enforce its rights under the loan documents until the trigger date of October 1, 2012 unless extended.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S3	Extension of the trigger date was contingent among other things upon delivering a fully executed contract to sell the property to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S4	Although the joint venture did not meet all of the requirements for extending the trigger date, it has delivered a fully executed contract to sell the property which has been approved by the lender.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S5	Through closing, the joint venture is committed to make monthly debt service payments at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.85% .
1004036_13_ITEM15_P148_S6	Additional interest accrues at a rate of Prime + 5.5% less the amount paid.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P203_S2	All references to the number of shares outstanding, per share amounts and share options data of the Company's common shares reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P203_S3	Since the number of Operating Partnership units did not change as a result of the split, each Operating Partnership unit owned by the Family Limited Partners is now exchangeable for four of the Company's common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P203_S4	Prior to the 2011 split, the exchange ratio was one unit for two common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	On July 6, 2011, the Company completed a public offering of 4.6 million common shares at a price of $25.662 per share.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P205_S2	These shares were registered by a registration statement that became effective on August 12, 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , the ownership interests of the Operating Partnership consisted of the following:
1004036_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon exercise of options or issuance of restricted share awards, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding unit to the Company on a four shares for one unit basis.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	The Company owned the remaining limited partnership common units and all of the general partnership common units.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Family Limited Partners as discussed in Note 1.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	Family Limited Partners are holders of Operating Partnership units that may be exchanged for the Company's common shares in a ratio of one unit for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P210_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	As discussed in Note 11, various Family Limited Partners exchanged during 2012 a total of 1,682,507 Operating Partnership units for 6,730,028 common shares of the Company and during 2011 exchanged 160,332 Operating Partnership units for 641,328 common shares of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P211_S1	Therefore, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital of $34.9 million during 2012 to reflect the transfer of ownership interests from a noncontrolling unit holder to a shareholder of the Company's common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P211_S2	The changes in the Company's ownership interests in the subsidiaries impacted consolidated equity during the periods shown as follows:
1004036_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	(1) In 2012 and 2011, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were made as a result of increases in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon exercise of options, share-based compensation and the issuance of common shares upon exchange of Operating Partnership units by Family Limited Partners.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P213_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 (in thousands, except per share amounts).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P213_S1	Note that per share amounts reflect a two-for-one split of the Company's common shares in January 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P214_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P214_S1	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per share computation, if the effect was dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P215_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of our common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per share.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P215_S1	The remaining senior exchangeable notes were exchanged for the Company's common shares during 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P216_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P216_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , 17,600 and 183,500 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P216_S2	No options were excluded from the computation for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P216_S3	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the noncontrolling interest limited partners as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P217_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 (in thousands, except per unit amounts):

1004036_13_ITEM15_P220_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon exercise of options or issues restricted common share awards, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit to the Company for every four common shares issued.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P221_S0	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per unit computation, if the effect was dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P222_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of the Company's common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per common share.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P222_S1	The remaining senior exchangeable notes were exchanged for the Company's common shares during 2011.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to four times the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P224_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , 4,400 and 45,875 options were excluded from the computation.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	The Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P225_S1	The impact of the unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	We have a shareholder approved share-based compensation plan, the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P226_S1	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P226_S2	Through December 31, 2012 , we had granted 7,337,760 options, net of options forfeited, and 3,340,820 restricted common share awards, net of restricted common shares forfeited, and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 1,176,000 common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P226_S3	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 3,545,420 common shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan are determined by the Share and Unit Option Committee of the Board of Directors.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	During 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Board of Directors approved the grant of 346,000 , 329,000 and 312,750 restricted common shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P228_S1	The independent directors' restricted common shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted common shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P228_S2	For all of the restricted common share awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P228_S3	In addition, during February 2012, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 225,000 restricted common shares with a grant date fair value of $25.44 to Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, under the terms of his amended and restated Employment Agreement (the "Employment Agreement") signed on February 28, 2012.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P228_S4	Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, the Company granted Mr. Tanger the following: 45,000 fully-vested common shares; 90,000 restricted common shares that vest ratably over five years based on Mr. Tanger's continued employment with the Company and 90,000 restricted common shares that vest ratably over five years based on Mr. Tanger's continued employment with the Company and the Company achieving certain minimum total returns to shareholders.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	In February 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 191,500 options to non-executive employees of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P229_S1	The exercise price of the options granted during the first quarter of 2011 is $26.06 which equaled the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P229_S2	The options expire 10 years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P229_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the 2011 grant: expected dividend yield 3.0% ; expected life of 7 years; expected volatility of 32.8% ; a risk-free rate of 2.9% ; and forfeiture rates of 3.0% to 20.0% dependent upon the employee's position within the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	Also, during the first quarter of 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee Approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, (the "2010 Multi Year Performance Plan").
1004036_13_ITEM15_P230_S1	Under the 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, we granted 392,000 notional units, net of notional units forfeited, to award recipients as a group.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	If the Company's aggregate share price appreciation during the four year period beginning January 1, 2010 equals or exceeds the minimum threshold of 40%, then the notional units will convert into the Company's restricted common shares on a one-for- one basis.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P232_S0	The notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for- two basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the target threshold of 50% and on a one-for- three basis if the share price appreciation exceeds the maximum of 60%.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P232_S1	The notional amounts will convert on a pro-rata basis between share price appreciation thresholds.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P232_S2	The share price targets will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period, subject to a minimum level price target.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P232_S3	For notional amounts granted in 2010, any shares earned on December 31, 2013 will vest on December 31, 2014 contingent on continued employment through the vesting date.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P233_S0	The notional units, prior to the date they are converted into restricted common shares, will not entitle award recipients to receive any dividends or other distributions.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P233_S1	If the notional units are earned, and thereby converted into restricted common shares, then award recipients will be entitled to receive a payment of all dividends and other distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned common shares been issued at the beginning of the performance period.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P233_S2	Thereafter, dividends and other distributions will be paid currently with respect to all restricted common shares that were earned.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P234_S0	At the end of the four-year performance period, if the minimum share price threshold is not achieved but the Company's share performance exceeds the 50th percentile of the share performance of its peer group, the notional units will convert into restricted common shares on a one-for- one basis.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P234_S1	All determinations, interpretations and assumptions relating to the vesting and calculation of the performance awards will be made by the Company's Compensation Committee.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P235_S0	We recorded share based compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, as follows (in thousands):

1004036_13_ITEM15_P243_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P244_S0	As discussed in Note 16, the Operating Partnership and the Company have a joint plan whereby equity based and performance based awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P245_S0	When common shares are issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues corresponding units to the Company based on the current exchange ratio as provided by the Operating Partnership agreement.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P245_S1	Based on the current exchange ratio, each unit in the Operating Partnership is equivalent to four common shares of the Company.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P245_S2	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P245_S3	The maximum units that may be issued to the Company due to equity awards granted by the Company are limited by the Plan to 15.4 million of the Company's common shares, or in terms of units, 3,850,000 units.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P260_S0	We are also subject to legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and have not been finally adjudicated.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P260_S1	In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

1004036_13_ITEM15_P437_S1	In connection with such delivery, the Company shall either (i) make delivery of certificates, if any, representing the Common Shares which a Participant is entitled to receive in accordance with the terms of the Program and the Incentive Plan or (ii) evidence the ownership of the Common Shares which a Participant is entitled to receive by the book-entry method, unless prohibited by the Incentive Plan.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P438_S0	(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program, if at the time of a Participant's Separation from Service, such Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A, as reasonably determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A, and the deferral of the commencement of any distributions otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such Separation from Service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, then the Company will defer the commencement of any such distributions hereunder (without any reduction or increase in the amounts ultimately distributed or provided to the Participant) until the date that is at least six months following the Participant's Separation from Service with the Company (or the earliest date permitted under Section 409A), whereupon the Company will distribute to the Participant a lump-sum amount of Common Shares equal to the number of Common Shares that would have otherwise been previously distributed to the Participant under this Program during the period in which such distributions were deferred.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P438_S1	Thereafter, distributions will resume in accordance with this Program.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P439_S0	The Program will be effective as of July 31, 2012 (the Effective Date ) and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11(a), shall expire on, and no Deferred Shares may be granted pursuant to the Program after the last date upon which Awards can be granted under the Incentive Plan.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P439_S1	Any Deferred Shares outstanding upon termination of the Program shall remain in force according to the terms of the Program and any documentation evidencing such Deferred Shares.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P440_S0	The Program may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Board; provided that, to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, the Company will obtain shareholder approval of any Program amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as required.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P440_S1	Upon a Change in Control that constitutes a change in control event within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i), the Company shall terminate the Program and, in connection with any such termination, deliver to each Participant the Common Shares credited to his or her Account, subject to and in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (or any successor provision thereto).
1004036_13_ITEM15_P440_S2	No amendment, suspension or termination of this Program shall, without the consent of the Participant, materially and disproportionately alter or impair any rights or obligations of any Participant with respect to any Deferred Shares granted hereunder.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P440_S3	No Deferred Shares may be granted under this Program during any period of suspension or after termination of this Program.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Program or the Incentive Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Board determines that any provision of the Program could otherwise cause any person to be subject to the penalty taxes imposed under Section 409A, the Board reserves the right (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify any Participant for failure to do so) to adopt such amendments to the Program and any and all applicable documentation evidencing the Deferred Shares or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P441_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of the Program or any documentation evidencing the Deferred Shares shall be interpreted or construed to transfer any liability for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A from a Participant or any other individual to the Company or any of its affiliates, employees or agents.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P442_S0	(a) Deferred Shares awarded under this Program (and any interest or right therein) may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in any manner other than (i) (A) by will, (B) the laws of descent and distribution or (C) to the named beneficiary upon death indicated on the Deferral Election Form, if any, or (ii) with the consent of the Board, pursuant to a transfer to the spouse and/or lineal descendants of the Participant and/or to a trust, partnership or other entity the sole beneficiaries, partners or other members of which are such Participant's spouse and/or lineal descendants.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P442_S1	No Deferred Shares or interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or his successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P443_S0	(b) To the extent that the application of any formula described in this Program does not result in a whole number of Common Shares, the result will be rounded upwards to the next whole number.
1004036_13_ITEM15_P444_S0	(c) Nothing in the Program or any documentation evidencing the Deferred Shares granted thereunder shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue as a Director of the Company, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company, the Partnership or any Subsidiary, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Participant and the Company, the Partnership or any Subsidiary.

1004036_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 37 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.5 million square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	These outlet centers were 99% occupied and contained over 2,400 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	We also had partial ownership interests in 7 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.7 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company, through its ownership of the Tanger GP and Tanger LP Trusts, owned 94,505,685 units of the Operating Partnership and the Non-Company LPs collectively owned 5,145,012 Class A common limited partnership units.

1004036_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	In October 2003, we and two other owners each having a 33.3% ownership interest, established a joint venture to develop and own a shopping center in Deer Park, New York ("Deer Park").
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	In August 2013, Deer Park successfully negotiated new financing of the debt obligations for the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans totaling approximately $238.5 million , with a $150.0 million mortgage loan.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	The new five year mortgage loan bears interest at a 150 basis point spread over LIBOR.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	The previous mortgage and mezzanine loans were in default, and as part of the refinancing, all default interest associated with the loans was waived.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	Utilizing funding from our existing unsecured lines of credit, we loaned approximately $89.5 million at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and due on August 30, 2020 to Deer Park representing the remaining amount necessary to repay the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S5	As a result of the refinancing, Deer Park recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $13.8 million .
1004036_14_ITEM1_P6_S6	Our share of this gain along with our share of the income from the settlement of a lawsuit by Deer Park with a third party totalled approximately $7.8 million , which has been included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	On August 30, 2013, we acquired an additional one-third interest in the Deer Park property from one of the other owners, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, for total consideration of approximately $27.9 million , including $13.9 million in cash and 450,576 in Class A common limited partnership units of Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, which are exchangeable for an equivalent number of the Company's common shares.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	This transaction was accounted for as a business combination resulting in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at fair value as a result of the step acquisition.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	The fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $83.8 million, consisting of $319.4 million in rental property and lease related intangibles, $2.3 million in other identifiable assets and liabilities, and $237.9 million in debt.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	Upon acquiring an additional one-third interest, we determined, based on the acquisition agreement and other transaction documents which amended our rights with respect to the property and our obligations with respect to the additional one-third interest, that we control the property assets and direct the property s significant activities and therefore, consolidate the property s assets and liabilities as of August 30, 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Following the acquisition, we and the noncontrolling interest restructured certain aspects of our ownership of the property, whereby we receive substantially all of the economics generated by the property and have substantial control over the property's financial activities.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Under the new structure, we serve as property manager and control the management, leasing, marketing and other operations of the property.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition, we and the noncontrolling interest have entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million , and we have the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Deer Park center offers over 90 brand name and designer outlet stores, approximately 10 restaurants, and a 16 screen movie theater which serve the 18 million people that reside within a 60 mile radius.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In September 2013, we broke ground on Tanger Outlets at Foxwoods located at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We own a controlling interest in the project, which will be consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	The approximately 314,000 square foot center will feature approximately 80 brand name and designer outlet stores and will be suspended above ground to join the resort's two casino floors, which attract millions of visitors each year.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	We currently expect the property to open in the second quarter of 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	We also intend to develop an approximately 350,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center in the Grand Rapids, Michigan market.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	The site is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Center, Michigan with visibility from both roads.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	The center will be located approximately 30 miles east of Lake Michigan and its lakeside communities that are frequented by vacationers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	Currently, we estimate the center will open in the second half of 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2013, we completed two expansions at existing properties within our wholly-owned portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	In April, we expanded Tanger Outlets Gonzales in Gonzales, Louisiana by approximately 40,000 square feet, bringing the center's total gross leasable area to approximately 319,000 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	In September, we expanded Tanger Outlets Sevierville in Sevierville, Tennessee by approximately 20,000 square feet, bringing the center's total gross leasable area to approximately 438,000 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	In November 2013, we and our 50/50 joint venture partner hosted the grand opening of Tanger Outlets National Harbor.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Located within the National Harbor waterfront resort in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, the center is accessible from I-95, I-295, I-495, and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	The nation's capital welcomes approximately 33 million tourist visitors annually.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	The center includes approximately 336,000 square feet and features approximately 80 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	During 2013, our joint venture in Canada broke ground on two development projects.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	In May 2013, construction commenced on Tanger Outlets Ottawa, the first ground up development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Ottawa is the nation's capital and its fourth largest city, with 1.2 million residents and 7.5 million annual visitors.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Located in suburban Kanata off the TransCanada Highway (Highway 417) at Palladium Drive, the 303,000 square foot center will feature approximately 80 brand name and designer outlet stores and is currently expected to open in time for the 2014 holiday shopping season.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Also in May 2013, the joint venture broke ground on a major expansion and renovation of Tanger Outlets Cookstown.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	The project will expand the 156,000 square foot property, which was acquired in December 2011, to nearly double its size to approximately 310,000 square feet when complete.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	Currently expected to be a holiday 2014 opening, the project will expand the property's tenancy by approximately 35 new brand name and designer outlet stores, while creating an updated exterior for the existing space consistent with that of the expansion.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Cookstown is 30 miles north of the Greater Toronto Area directly off Highway 400 at Highway 89.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	This region is a well-traveled year round vacation area where visitors enjoy snow skiing in the winter and lakeside activities in the summer.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	In September 2013, we and our 50/50 joint venture partner broke ground on a new outlet center in the Charlotte, North Carolina market.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	The center will be located eight miles southwest of uptown Charlotte at the interchange of I-485 and Steele Creek Road (NC Highway 160), two major thoroughfares for the city.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	The approximately 400,000 square foot project will feature approximately 90 brand name and designer outlet stores and is expected to open during the third quarter of 2014.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	In January 2014, we announced our plans to develop Tanger Outlets Savannah through a joint venture arrangement.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The center will include approximately 385,000 square feet and feature approximately 90 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	In January 2014 we purchased the land on which the center is being developed for $12.9 million and contributed it to the joint venture in February 2014.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	As of the date of this filing our equity contributions totaled $17.1 million and our partner's equity contribution totaled $7.4 million.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	The site is located on I-95, just north of I-16 in Pooler, Georgia, adjacent to the City of Savannah, and near the Savannah International Airport.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	We expect the center's location to capitalize on the Tanger Outlets brand equity in the region and to provide marketing and management synergies with our centers in Charleston, Hilton Head, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Commerce and Locust Grove, Georgia.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments, including sites located in Columbus, Ohio; and Scottsdale, Arizona; as well as planned expansions of existing centers in Park City, Utah; Branson, Missouri and Glendale, Arizona.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Columbus site and the Glendale expansion, if developed, will be undertaken by joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	As of the date of this filing, we are marketing 5 outlet centers for sale.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	We have not entered into a binding contract and have not obtained approval from our Board of Directors to sell the outlet centers, thus we can give no assurance that the sales will be completed.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	Proceeds generated by these asset sales, if completed, will be used to fund the development projects discussed above, pay down outstanding debt and/or for other general corporate purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage we assumed as part of the Deer Park acquisition described above.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures in August 2018.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30%, creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	In October 2013, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity, and reducing the overall borrowing costs.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The maturity of these facilities was extended from November 10, 2015 to October 24, 2017 with the ability to further extend the maturity for an additional year at our option.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	The annual commitment fee, which is payable on the full $520.0 million in loan commitments, was reduced from 0.175% to 0.15%, and the interest rate spread over LIBOR was reduced from 1.10% to 1.00% based on our current credit rating.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	In November 2013, we announced that Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, completed a public offering of $250 million in senior notes due 2023 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	The notes were priced at 98.360% of the principal amount to yield 4.076% to maturity.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.875% per annum and mature on December 1, 2023.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Outlets are stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, which enhance their profit potential.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Outlet centers enable them to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Each of our outlet centers carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have developed long-standing relationships with many of our tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Because of our established relationships, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 741,981 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as American Eagle, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Carters, Calvin Klein, Coach Leatherware, Eddie Bauer, GAP, J. Crew, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Nike, Old Navy, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue - Off Fifth, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour and others.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2013, 2012 or 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , no single tenant accounted for more than 7.8% of our leasable square feet or 5.0% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Because our typical tenant is a large, national manufacturer, we generally do not experience any material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 90% of our total revenues in 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues in 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 33 years.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , our consolidated outlet centers were 99% occupied with average tenant sales of $387 per square foot.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing centers, renovating and expanding our mature centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	Future centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe our 33 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 50% of the space in each center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 50% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the center.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Keeping our shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a remerchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	The long-standing retailer relationships that we enjoy allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	In order for our centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, website, internet advertising, social networks, smart phone applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P58_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2014.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new center.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls and full- and off-price retailers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P65_S3	Traditional full- and off-price retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers not be within a close proximity of a major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	For this reason, our centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to minimize the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , and 2012 , we had one reportable operating segment.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	For financial information regarding our segment, see our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina in which our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	We maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 39 centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease agreement with us.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we had 279 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 39 business offices.
1004036_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	At that date, we also employed 335 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Such bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders' interests.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We own partial interests in outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of war and earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Consumer travel, shopping and spending habits may change.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Most shoppers use private automobile transportation to travel to our outlet centers and many of our centers are not easily accessible by public transportation.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Increasing fuel costs may reduce the number of trips to our centers thus reducing the amount spent at our centers.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such reductions in traffic could adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Shoppers may also choose to spend a greater percentage of their disposable income to purchase goods through e-commerce channels, which could also reduce the number of trips to our centers and the average amount spent per visit.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such a change in consumer spending habits could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, taxable U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We use such systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and to serve our customers timely.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release or loss of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.
1004036_14_ITEM1A_P39_S6	As a result, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2014 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 37 outlet centers totaling 11.5 million square feet located in 24 states.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in seven other outlet centers totaling approximately 1.7 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including three outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 741,981 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our Deer Park, New York, center is the only property that represents 10% or more of our consolidated total assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	See "Properties - Significant Property" for further details.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring centers, developing new centers and expanding existing centers.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of the 37 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 31 and have ground leases on six.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the six centers are located:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable center.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2014 :
1004036_14_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2014 .
1004036_14_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P9_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2014 , scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P10_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 778,000 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P10_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2014 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P10_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P11_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P12_S0	(1) Represents the percentage of total square footage at the beginning of each year that is scheduled to expire during the respective year.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P13_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P14_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P14_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers:
1004036_14_ITEM2_P15_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for our consolidated outlet centers with respect to our ten largest tenants and their store concepts as of February 1, 2014 :
1004036_14_ITEM2_P16_S0	The Deer Park, New York outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P16_S1	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, and then restructured certain aspects of the remaining one-third ownership of the property, the effects of which gave us a controlling ownership interest.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P16_S2	With the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest, we have consolidated Deer Park in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P16_S3	Previously Deer Park was reported within our unconsolidated portfolio of properties.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P17_S0	Tenants at the Deer Park outlet center principally conduct retail sales operations.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P17_S1	The following table shows occupancy and certain base rental information related to this property as of December 31, 2013 :
1004036_14_ITEM2_P18_S0	(1) Note that center was acquired during August 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P18_S1	Represents average base rental rates per weighted average square foot since the acquisition date.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P19_S0	Depreciation on the outlet centers is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P19_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 33 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_14_ITEM2_P19_S2	Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	At December 31, 2013 , we had 37 consolidated outlet centers in 24 states totaling 11.5 million square feet.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest, Deer Park has been consolidated in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table provides information for our consolidated outlet centers regarding space re-leased or renewed during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively:
1004036_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	(1) Net average straight-line rent is calculated by dividing the average tenant allowance costs per square foot by the average initial term and subtracting this calculated number from the average straight-line rent per year amount.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The average annual straight-line rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	NET INCOME Net income increased approximately $56.8 million in the 2013 period to $113.3 million as compared to $56.5 million for the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The increase in net income was a result of a $28.0 million increase in operating revenues, a $26.0 million increase from a gain on a previously held interest in an acquired joint venture and a $14.3 million increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Subsequent to the third quarter of 2012, we developed or acquired 5 additional unconsolidated joint venture outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	These increases in income were partially offset by an increase in property operating expenses of $9.9 million, increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.7 million and an increase in interest expense of $1.8 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $18.2 million , or 8% , in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals, incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, as well as incremental rental revenue from the expansion of one center in 2012 and two centers in 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third interest in the Deer Park property from one of the partners, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	we have consolidated the results of the property since the acquisition date for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	At December 31, 2013, the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset which totaled approximately $10.7 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	The decrease in base rent recognized from the amortization of above and below market lease values related primarily to the amortization of net above market lease assets recorded from the Deer Park acquisition.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	In addition, several below market leases from previous acquisitions became fully amortized at the end of 2012 thus causing a decrease in base rent in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $8.5 million , or 8% , in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Existing property expense reimbursements increased in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period as a result of an increase in recoverable property operating expenses, a modest increase in the portfolio's overall average occupancy rate, and due to a number of leases recently executed which require a higher reimbursement amount of our operating expenses.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	OTHER INCOME Other income increased $1.2 million , or 13% , in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Other income increased primarily from fees earned from the unconsolidated joint ventures added to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012 and from the National Harbor joint venture which opened during November 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $9.9 million , or 9% , in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Property operating expenses increased at existing properties due to increases in mall office operating costs, snow removal costs, property insurance and real estate taxes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million , or 4% , in the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	In the 2012 period general and administrative expenses included $1.3 million of compensation expense related to 45,000 common shares that vested immediately, granted to Steven B. Tanger, pursuant to an amendment to his employment contract.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Excluding this charge, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.0 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2013 grants of restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the Company and the grant of performance shares to senior officers under a new long term incentive plan.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	Also, the 2013 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2012 period due to the addition of new employees throughout 2012 and 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The 2013 period included costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property as well as costs from other potential acquisitions of operating properties that were never completed.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased approximately $1.8 million, or 4% , in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was the increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $1.1 billion for the 2012 period to approximately $1.2 billion for the 2013 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of fundings for additional investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in both Canada and the United States and the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in Deer Park.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the Deer Park property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	With the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The acquisition resulted in a gain of approximately $26.0 million, representing the difference between the recorded value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $14.3 million in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The primary reasons for the increase related to transactions at the Deer Park property prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest and its subsequent consolidation for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	As a part of the refinance of the debt at Deer Park, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	Incremental earnings from the addition of four outlet centers held in unconsolidated joint ventures to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012 accounted for the remainder of the increase.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	NET INCOME Net income increased approximately $5.5 million in the 2012 period to $56.5 million as compared to $51.0 million for the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in net income was a result of a $41.8 million increase in operating revenues, a $2.6 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $158,000 decrease in abandoned development costs, partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in operating expenses, a $7.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, $4.4 million in higher interest costs, $14.7 million in higher depreciation and amortization amounts and $1.7 million in higher losses on unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	BASE RENTALS Base rentals increased $27.6 million, or 13%, in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the redevelopment of our 177,000 square foot outlet center in Hilton Head I, South Carolina and throughout 2011 acquired a total of four outlet centers adding approximately 1.3 million square feet to our consolidated outlet center portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	At December 31, 2012, the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset which totaled approximately $5.2 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	PERCENTAGE RENTALS Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above predetermined levels, increased $2.1 million, or 23%, in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increase in percentage rentals is partially related to new developments and acquisitions completed in the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, percentage rentals from existing properties increased 10% due to higher tenant sales productivity.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the rolling twelve months ended December 31, 2012 increased 2.9% to $376 per square foot.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS Expense reimbursements increased $11.5 million, or 13%, in the 2012 period as compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Existing property expense reimbursements increased in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period as a result of an increase in the portfolio's overall average occupancy rate, as well as a number of leases recently executed which require a higher reimbursement amount of our operating expenses.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	OTHER INCOME Other income increased $600,000, or 7%, in the 2012 period as compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The increase in fees recognized from unconsolidated joint ventures increased due to our entry into five new joint ventures in the 2011 and 2012 periods.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES Property operating expenses increased $10.9 million, or 11%, in the 2012 period as compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Increases at existing properties related to higher mall office operating costs, security and property insurance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	These costs were partially offset by lower snow removal costs across the portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million, or 24%, in the 2012 period as compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2012 restricted share grant to directors and certain officers of the Company and share-based compensation.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, the 2012 period included $1.3 million of compensation expense related to 45,000 common shares that vested immediately, granted to Steven B. Tanger, pursuant to an amendment to his employment contract.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	In addition, the 2012 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2011 period due to the addition of new employees since January 1, 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The 2012 period included acquisition costs incurred by us related to the two acquisitions through our RioCan joint venture in November 2012.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The 2011 period included costs related to the four acquisitions of consolidated properties described above in "General Overview," as well as one acquisition through our RioCan joint venture in December, 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization increased $14.7 million, or 17%, in the 2012 period as compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs increased in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period primarily as a result of the additional centers added to the portfolio during 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The depreciation and amortization from acquisitions includes the amortization of lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of the acquired properties which are amortized over shorter lives.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Depreciation and amortization from existing properties decreased as certain construction and development related assets and lease related intangible assets from these properties became fully depreciated during 2012.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased approximately $4.4 million, or 10%, in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was the increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $870.1 million for the 2011 period to approximately $1.1 billion for the 2012 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of the mortgages assumed as part of the acquisition of four properties, additional funding necessary for the development and acquisition projects described above and other general operating purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The increase in interest expense associated with the higher debt outstanding was partially offset by lower interest rates on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	These facilities were recast during the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting in the credit spread over LIBOR being reduced from 190 basis points to 125 basis points.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition, in February 2012, we entered into a term loan for $250.0 million with an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	EQUITY IN LOSSES OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES Equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $1.7 million, or 111%, in the 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in loss is due primarily to acquisition costs and abandoned due diligence costs incurred by our RioCan joint venture.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	The remaining increase in losses is attributable to joint ventures added during the year which in aggregate have depreciation in excess of their earnings before depreciation.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2015 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Based on our 2013 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $59.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	We distributed approximately $83.4 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our underperforming assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Cash provided by operating activities during 2013 was positively impacted by an increase in operating income throughout the consolidated portfolio, the acquisition of Deer Park in August 2013, and a $4.8 million increase in cash received from unconsolidated joint ventures as a result of the addition of five centers held in unconsolidated joint ventures since the third quarter of 2012.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Cash used in investing activities was higher in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period due primarily to a loan of approximately $89.5 million to Deer Park representing the remaining amount necessary to repay the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	This impact was partially offset by additional cash received from unconsolidated joint ventures that represented a return of investment, the most significant of which related to the Galveston/Houston joint venture.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	This venture closed on a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.0 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	The joint venture received total loan proceeds of $65.0 million and distributed the proceeds equally to the partners.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The change in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid to shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Significant transactions that impacted the cash used in financing activities in 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1004036_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	In November 2013, we announced that Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2023 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	On February 24, 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P70_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	In September 2013, we broke ground at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut on Tanger Outlets at Foxwoods.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	We own a controlling interest in the project, which will be consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	To date, we have contributed approximately $7.7 million to the project for construction and development activities.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The center will feature approximately 80 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The approximately 314,000 square foot project will be suspended above ground to join the resort's two casino floors, which attract millions of visitors each year.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	We currently expect the property to open in the second quarter of 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	We also intend to develop an approximately 350,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center in the Grand Rapids, Michigan market.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The site is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Center, Michigan with visibility from both roads.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	The center will be located approximately 30 miles east of Lake Michigan and its lakeside communities that are frequented by vacationers.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Currently, we estimate the property will open in the second half of 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	During 2013, we completed two expansions at existing properties within our wholly-owned portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	In April, we expanded Tanger Outlets Gonzales in Gonzales, Louisiana by approximately 40,000 square feet, bringing the property's total gross leasable area to approximately 319,000 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	In September, we expanded Tanger Outlets Sevierville in Sevierville, Tennessee by approximately 20,000 square feet, bringing the total gross leasable area to approximately 438,000 square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments, including sites located in Columbus, Ohio; and Scottsdale, Arizona; as well as planned expansions of existing centers in Park City, Utah; Branson, Missouri and Glendale, Arizona.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The Columbus site and the Glendale expansion, if developed, will be undertaken by joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects from amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of the date of this filing, we are marketing the potential sale of 5 of our consolidated outlet centers.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	We have not entered into a binding contract and have not obtained final approval from our Board of Directors to sell these outlet centers, thus we can give no assurance that these sales will be completed.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	Proceeds generated by these asset sales, if completed, will be used to fund the development projects discussed above, pay down outstanding debt and/or for other general corporate purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have formed joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers that are currently in various stages of development in several markets.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , unsecured borrowings represented 81% of our outstanding debt and 80% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1.00%.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line and a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	The syndicated line may be increased to $750.0 million through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of October 24, 2017 with an option for a one year extension.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Deer Park, we assumed a $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The loan has a 5 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.50%.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30%, creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	In October 2013, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity, and reducing the overall borrowing costs.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The maturity of these facilities was extended from November 10, 2015 to October 24, 2017 with the ability to further extend the maturity for an additional year at our option.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The annual commitment fee, which is payable on the full $520.0 million in loan commitments, was reduced from 0.175% to 0.15%, and the interest rate spread over LIBOR was reduced from 1.10% to 1.00% based on our current credit rating.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	In November 2013, we announced that Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, completed a public offering of $250 million in senior notes due 2023 in an underwritten public offering.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	The term loan will be interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, the loan has an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60%.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	In June 2011, the Operating Partnership closed on a $150.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% and used the proceeds from the loan to fund the acquisition of the Jeffersonville, Ohio outlet center.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	In November 2011, the Operating Partnership repaid this bridge loan in conjunction with the recast of its unsecured lines of credit.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under its unsecured lines of credit and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2014.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2015 when our next significant debt maturities occur.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our dividend and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	New center development expenditures, which includes first generation tenant improvement allowances, included expansions in Gonzales, Louisiana and Sevierville, Tennessee and the initial development costs associated with the construction of our center at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut in the 2013 period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	The 2012 period included expansions to our centers in Locust Grove, Georgia and Gonzales, Louisiana.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	The 2012 period included on-going renovation efforts at the centers acquired during the second and third quarters of 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Other capital expenditures in 2013 increased over the 2012 period due to a higher number of other capital expenditure projects within our existing consolidated portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2013 was used.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	(3) As part of the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Deer Park, we and the noncontrolling interest have entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million, and we have the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Due to the other owner's ability to require us to purchase their interest, we have recorded an obligation to redeem their interest at the redemption price as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of the balance sheet.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have commitments of $71.4 million remaining as of December 31, 2013 related to contracts to complete construction and development activity at centers throughout our consolidated portfolio.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $14.4 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	Our portion of contractual commitments to complete construction and development activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to approximately $42.9 million at December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	In addition, our portion of commitments related to tenant allowances at our joint ventures totalled approximately $3.7 million as of December 31, 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Our debt agreements contain covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	We believe our most restrictive covenants are contained in our senior, unsecured notes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	(1) For a complete listing of all debt covenants related to our senior unsecured notes, as well as definitions of the above terms, refer to our applicable supplemental indenture filing with the SEC.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Based on our 2013 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $59.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	We distributed approximately $83.4 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P103_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.

1004036_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P131_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P131_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P133_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P133_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P133_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	We capitalize all incremental, direct fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases as deferred charges.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P136_S1	We amortize these costs to expense over the minimum lease term.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P136_S2	We capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest costs, during the active development period.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P138_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P143_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P143_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P143_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P143_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	Funds from Operations represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P145_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P147_S2	In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only supplementally.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	(1) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted shares not considered participating securities, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	(2) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P152_S2	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	We present Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P153_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	In addition, we use AFFO, or some form of AFFO, when certain material, unplanned transactions occur, as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only supplementally.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	(1) Includes our share of acquisition costs, litigation settlement proceeds, abandoned development costs and gain on early extinguishment of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	The gain on early extinguishment of debt was $4.6 million and the litigation settlement proceeds were $3.2 million, for the year ended, December 31, 2013.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted shares not considered participating securities, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	(3) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	Same Center Net Operating Income We present Same Center Net Operating Income ( NOI ) as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	We define Net Operating Income ("NOI") as total operating revenues less property operating expenses.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	Same Center NOI represents the NOI for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, renovated or subject to a material, non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P162_S2	We believe that NOI and Same Center NOI provide useful information to our investors and analysts about our financial and operating performance because it provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P162_S3	Because Same Center NOI excludes the change in NOI from properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold, it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P162_S4	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	Same Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the Company's financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of the Company's entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact the Company's results from operations.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	Below is a reconciliation of income before equity in losses of unconsolidated joint ventures to Same Center NOI (in thousands):
1004036_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	(2) Excluded from Same Center NOI are the following:
1004036_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P166_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S1	During 2013 , approximately 2.0 million square feet, or 18%, of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.6 million, or 14%, of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2014 .
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S2	During 2013 , we renewed 81% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 19% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S3	We also re-tenanted 510,000 square feet at a 38% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P169_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P170_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P170_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 7.8% of our square feet or 5.0% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P170_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_14_ITEM7_P170_S4	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was approximately 99% for both periods.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We typically reinvest net cash flow from our Canadian joint ventures to fund future Canadian development activity.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P1_S7	We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Deer Park, we assumed a $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The loan has a 5 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.50%.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30%, creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S5	At December 31, 2013, the fair value of these contracts was $1.3 million.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates, remaining term to maturity and our credit standing.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , 21% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates, excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $2.7 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.2 billion , respectively, and its recorded value was $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.1 billion , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately $ 46.3 million and $ 34.8 million , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr. (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2013 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	(c) There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Vice President and Treasurer, Frank C.

1004036_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Operating Partnership's board of trustees, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P12_S1	The Operating Partnership's management, with the participation of the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P13_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Operating Partnership's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P14_S0	The Operating Partnership's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Operating Partnership's management has concluded that the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P16_S0	The effectiveness of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1004036_14_ITEM9A_P17_S0	(c) There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P77_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	To the Partners of Tanger Properties Limited Partnership:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	Also in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Partnership's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P81_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we owned and operated 37 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.5 million square feet.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P95_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	These outlet centers were 99% occupied and contained over 2,400 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in 7 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.7 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P97_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company, through its ownership of Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 94,505,685 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the "Non-Company LPs") collectively owned 5,145,012 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S4	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P98_S5	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P99_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	We evaluate our real estate joint ventures in accordance with the Consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC").
1004036_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that our Westgate joint venture is a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") and none of our other joint ventures are a VIE.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P100_S2	Westgate is considered a VIE because the voting rights are disproportionate to the economic interests.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	After making the determination that Westgate was a VIE, we performed an assessment to determine if we would be considered the primary beneficiary and thus be required to consolidate its balance sheet and results of operations.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	This assessment was based upon whether we had the following:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	The operating, development, leasing, and management agreement of Westgate provides that the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the venture require unanimous consent.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	Accordingly, we determined that we do not have the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the ventures and therefore, have applied the equity method of accounting for Westgate.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	Our equity method investment in Westgate as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $16.1 million .
1004036_14_ITEM15_P103_S3	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and based on the future operating performance of Westgate.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Non-Company LPs percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P104_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interest.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	Estimates are used in the calculations of impairment losses, costs capitalized to originate operating leases, costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, and the values of deferred lease costs and other intangibles related to the acquisition of properties.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P106_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	Operating Segments - We focus exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	Costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including certain overhead costs, are capitalized.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	The amount of overhead costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P108_S3	Direct costs to acquire existing centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P110_S3	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 33 years.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P112_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P112_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P112_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P113_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	As a part of acquisition accounting, the amount by which the fair value of our previously held equity method investment exceeds the carrying book value is recorded as a gain on previously held interest in acquired joint venture.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	Interest costs capitalized during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 amounted to approximately $1.6 million , $1.2 million and $393,000 , respectively, and internal development costs capitalized amounted to $2.2 million , $1.8 million and $1.4 million , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P115_S2	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in net income for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $74.7 million , $73.7 million and $66.2 million , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P116_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $670,000 and $670,000 , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including internal lease costs and amounts paid to third-party brokers, during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were approximately $4.0 million , $5.1 million and $10.7 million , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Captive Insurance - Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Northline Indemnity, LLC, is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	We recognized no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	We believe there are no unrecorded impairment losses as of December 31, 2013 .
1004036_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Real Estate Assets Held For Sale - Real estate assets designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	We classify real estate as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P125_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P125_S3	The operating results of real estate assets designated as held for sale and for assets sold, in which we will not have any significant continuing involvement, are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our results of operations.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P127_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P128_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P129_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P130_S6	The tax years 2010 - 2013 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were taxable as follows:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 :
1004036_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded in other assets were approximately $30.9 million and $25.1 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P152_S1	With the acquisition of this additional interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date, and remeasured our previously held interest that was accounted for as an equity method investment.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	Prior to the acquisition, Deer Park successfully negotiated new financing of the debt obligations for the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans totaling approximately $238.5 million , with a $150.0 million mortgage loan.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P153_S1	The new five year mortgage loan bears interest at a 150 basis point spread over LIBOR.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P153_S2	The previous mortgage and mezzanine loans were in default, and as part of the refinancing, all default interest associated with the loans was waived.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	This transaction was accounted for as a business combination resulting in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at fair value as a result of the step acquisition.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P154_S2	Prior to the acquisition, the joint venture was considered a variable interest entity and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we did not have the ability to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the venture as a one-third owner.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P154_S3	Upon acquiring an additional one-third interest, we determined, based on the acquisition agreement and other transaction documents which amended our rights with respect to the property and our obligations with respect to the additional one-third interest, that we control the property assets and direct the property s significant activities and therefore, consolidate the property s assets and liabilities.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P216_S1	We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently do not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P217_S1	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, if any, is recognized directly in earnings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	The following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands):

1004036_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	As of December 31, 2012 our financial statements did not contain any assets or liabilities measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, mortgages unsecured term loans and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively, and its recorded value was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P223_S1	Fair values were determined, based on level 2 inputs, using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	After the effect of the split, each Class A common limited partnership unit held by Non-Company LPs may be exchanged for one common share of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P231_S2	Prior to the split, each unit held by the Non-Company LPs was exchangeable for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P231_S3	All references to the number of units outstanding and per unit amounts reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	All units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership have equal rights with respect to earnings, dividends and net assets.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P232_S1	When the Company issues common shares upon the exercise of options, the issuance of restricted share awards or the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding Class B common limited partnership unit to Tanger LP trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	Also, in August 2013 as disclosed in Note 3, the Operating Partnership issued 450,576 Class A common limited partnership units as partial consideration for the acquisition of an additional one-third interest in Deer Park.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in outstanding partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Non-Company LPs as discussed in Note 2.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	As discussed in Note 11, Non-Company LPs exchanged during 2013 a total of 67,428 Class A common limited partnership units for an equal number of common shares of the Company and during 2012 exchanged 6,730,028 Class A common limited partnership units for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P236_S1	Therefore, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital of $11.1 million during 2013 and $34.9 million in 2012 to reflect the transfer of ownership interests from a noncontrolling unit holder to a shareholder of the Company's common shares.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P236_S2	The changes in the Company's ownership interests in the subsidiaries impacted consolidated equity during the periods shown as follows:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	(1) In 2013 and 2012, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were made as a result of increases in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon exercise of options, share-based compensation and the issuance of common shares upon exchange of Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1004036_14_ITEM15_P239_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per share computation, if the effect was dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of our common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per share.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P241_S1	The remaining senior exchangeable notes were exchanged for the Company's common shares during 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P242_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , no options were excluded from the computation, and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 17,600 , and 183,500 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P242_S2	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P243_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P243_S1	The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P243_S2	Unvested restricted common shares that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P244_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per unit amounts).
1004036_14_ITEM15_P244_S1	Note that all per unit amounts reflect a four -for-one split of the Operating Partnership's units in August 2013:
1004036_14_ITEM15_P245_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P246_S0	When the Company issues common shares upon the exercise of options or issues restricted share awards, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding Class B common limited partnership unit to Tanger LP Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for each Company common share issued.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P247_S0	Outstanding senior, exchangeable notes were included in the diluted earnings per unit computation, if the effect was dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P248_S0	In applying the treasury stock method, the effect was dilutive if the average market price of the Company's common shares for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days at the end of each quarter were higher than the exchange price, which prior to redemption was $17.83 per share.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P248_S1	The remaining senior exchangeable notes were exchanged for the Company's common shares during 2011.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P249_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P250_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P250_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , no options were excluded from the computation, and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 17,600 and 183,500 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P251_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P251_S1	The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P251_S2	Unvested restricted common units that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P252_S0	We have a shareholder approved equity-based compensation plan, the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P253_S0	For each common share issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P253_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P254_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P255_S0	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P255_S1	Through December 31, 2013 , we had granted 7,332,760 options, net of options forfeited, and 3,678,193 restricted common share awards, net of restricted common shares forfeited, and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 1,248,919 common shares.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P255_S2	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 3,140,128 common shares.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P255_S3	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan were determined by the Share and Unit Option Committee of the Board of Directors.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P256_S0	In February 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2013 Outperformance Plan (the 2013 OPP").
1004036_14_ITEM15_P256_S1	The 2013 OPP provides for the grant of performance shares under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P257_S0	The 2013 OPP is a long-term incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients may earn up to an aggregate of 315,150 restricted common shares of the Company based on the Company s absolute share price appreciation (or total shareholder return) and its share price appreciation relative to its peer group, over a three year measurement period from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P257_S1	The maximum number of shares will be earned under this plan if the Company both (a) achieves 35% or higher share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid, over the three -year measurement period and (b) is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the three -year measurement period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P257_S2	The maximum value of the awards that could be earned on December 31, 2015, if the Company achieves or exceeds the 35% share price appreciation and is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the three -year measurement period, will equal approximately $13.3 million .
1004036_14_ITEM15_P258_S0	Any shares earned on December 31, 2015 are also subject to a time based vesting schedule, with 50% of the shares vesting on January 4, 2016 and the remaining 50% vesting on January 3, 2017, contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the vesting dates.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P259_S0	With respect to 70% of the performance shares (or 220,605 shares), 33.33% of this portion of the award (or 73,535 shares) will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 25% over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of the award (or 147,070 shares) will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period equals 30% , and 100% of this portion of the award (or 220,605 shares) will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 35% or higher.

1004036_14_ITEM15_P260_S1	The peer group will be based on the SNL Equity REIT index.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P261_S0	The performance shares will convert on a pro-rata basis by linear interpolation between share price appreciation thresholds, both for absolute share price appreciation and for relative share price appreciation amongst the Company's peer group.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P261_S1	The share price targets will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P261_S2	The compensation expense is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P261_S3	The fair value of the awards are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P262_S0	During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the Board of Directors approved the grant of 349,373 , 346,000 and 329,000 restricted common shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P262_S1	The independent directors' restricted common shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted common shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P262_S2	For all of the restricted common share awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P262_S3	In addition, during February 2012, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 225,000 restricted common shares with a grant date fair value of $25.44 to Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, under the terms of his amended and restated Employment Agreement (the "Employment Agreement") signed on February 28, 2012.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P262_S4	Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, the Company granted Mr. Tanger the following: 45,000 fully-vested common shares; 90,000 restricted common shares that vest ratably over five years based on Mr. Tanger's continued employment with the Company and 90,000 restricted common shares that vest ratably over five years based on Mr. Tanger's continued employment with the Company and the Company achieving certain minimum total returns to shareholders.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P263_S0	In February 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 191,500 options to non-executive employees of the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P263_S1	The exercise price of the options granted during the first quarter of 2011 is $26.06 which equaled the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P263_S2	The options expire 10 years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P263_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the 2011 grant: expected dividend yield 3.0% ; expected life of 7 years; expected volatility of 32.8% ; a risk-free rate of 2.9% ; and forfeiture rates of 3.0% to 20.0% dependent upon the employee's position within the Company.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P264_S0	Also, during the first quarter of 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee Approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, (the "2010 Multi Year Performance Plan").
1004036_14_ITEM15_P264_S1	Under the 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, we granted 392,000 notional units, net of notional units forfeited, to award recipients as a group, which would convert into restricted common shares on a one-for one basis, one-for two basis, or one-for-three basis depending upon the amount by which the Company's common shares appreciated above a minimum level over a four year performance period ending December 31, 2013, not to exceed a total value of approximately $32.2 million .
1004036_14_ITEM15_P264_S2	Based on the Company's performance over the four year measurement period, we issued 933,769 restricted common shares in January 2014 which will vest on December 31, 2014 contingent on continued employment through the vesting date.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P264_S3	In accordance with the plan, on December 31, 2013, we accrued approximately $3.8 million which represented cumulative dividends that would have been paid to the award recipients had the number of earned common shares been issued at the beginning of the performance period.
1004036_14_ITEM15_P264_S4	The amount accrued was paid in January 2014.

1004036_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.3 million square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	These outlet centers were 98% occupied and contained over 2,400 stores, representing approximately 380 store brands.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	We also had partial ownership interests in 9 outlet centers totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company, through its ownership of the Tanger GP and Tanger LP Trusts, owned 95,509,781 units of the Operating Partnership and the Non-Company LPs collectively owned 5,078,406 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of our common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We also operate in a manner intended to enable us to preserve our status as a REIT, including, among other things, making distributions with respect to our then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of our taxable income each year.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company is a North Carolina corporation that was incorporated in March 1993 and the Operating Partnership is a North Carolina partnership that was formed in May 1993.

1004036_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	At the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, construction continued throughout 2014 on Tanger Outlets at Foxwoods.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The outlet center will contain approximately 313,000 square feet and will be suspended above ground to join the casino floors of the two major hotels located within the resort.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Along with other various on-site entertainment venues, the casinos attract millions of visitors each year.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Construction originally commenced in September 2013 and currently we anticipate the outlet center will open during the second quarter of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2014, our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $1.0 million and our equity contributions totaled approximately $45.8 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our contributions have been funded with borrowings under our lines of credit and cash flow from operations.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition, the joint venture has a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.3 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	The loan initially matures in December 2017, with two one -year extension options.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	The balance of this loan as of December 31, 2014 was $25.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 67% .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	In July 2014, we purchased land for approximately $8.0 million and commenced construction on the development of an approximately 350,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The site is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Township, Michigan, with visibility from both roads.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	The outlet center will be located approximately 30 miles east of Lake Michigan and its lakeside communities that are frequented by vacationers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Currently, we anticipate the outlet center will open in the second half of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	Costs incurred as of December 31, 2014, which have been funded with borrowings under our lines of credit and cash flow from operations, totaled approximately $19.7 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	In January 2015, we purchased land for approximately $14.8 million and commenced construction on the development of an approximately 310,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The outlet center will be located less than five miles south of Memphis in Southaven, Mississippi at the northeast quadrant of I-69/55 and Church Road, with visibility on I-69/55.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The outlet center is being developed through a joint venture in which we own a controlling interest and is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	During 2014, we completed three expansions at existing properties within our wholly-owned portfolio.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	In May, we expanded our outlet center in Charleston, South Carolina by approximately 17,000 square feet, bringing the outlet center's total gross leasable area to approximately 382,000 square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	In November, we expanded our outlet centers in Park City, Utah and Branson, Missouri by a combined 48,000 square feet, bringing the outlet center's total gross leasable area to approximately 320,000 and 330,000 square feet, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	In July 2014, we opened a 398,000 square foot outlet center in Charlotte, NC that was developed through, and is owned by, a joint venture formed in May 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	The outlet center is located eight miles southwest of uptown Charlotte at the interchange of I-485 and Steele Creek Road (North Carolina Highway 160).
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	Construction of the outlet center, which commenced during the third quarter of 2013, was initially funded with equal equity contributions by the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	In November 2014, the joint venture closed on an interest only mortgage loan for $90.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.45% .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	The loan initially matures in November 2018, with the option to extend the maturity for one additional year.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	The joint venture received net loan proceeds of $89.4 million and distributed them equally to the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P15_S6	The loan balance as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $90.0 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	In November 2014, the joint venture amended the initial construction loan to increase the amount available to borrow from $62.0 million to $87.0 million and extended the maturity date until November 2019.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The loan still carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	At the closing of the amendment, the joint venture distributed approximately $19.0 million equally between the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	The loan balance as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $83.7 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have entered into a 50 /50 co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	In October 2014, the co-owners opened Tanger Outlets Ottawa, the first ground up development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Located in suburban Kanata off the TransCanada Highway (Highway 417) at Palladium Drive, the outlet center currently contains approximately 288,000 square feet, with additional square footage totaling approximately 28,000 square feet related to an anchor tenant expected to be completed and opened in early 2016.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	During the second quarter of 2013, the co-owners purchased the land for $28.7 million and broke ground on construction.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	As of December 31, 2014, our share of the costs incurred to date for the development of the outlet center, which was funded with equity, totaled approximately $45.3 million .

1004036_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The co-owners acquired land adjacent to the existing Cookstown Outlet Mall in March 2013 for $13.8 million and commenced construction of the expansion in May 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our share of the incurred costs related to the expansion and renovation of the existing outlet center, which was funded with equity, totaled approximately $27.1 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	In January 2014, we announced a joint venture arrangement to develop Tanger Outlets Savannah.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	The outlet center will include approximately 377,000 square feet, and is located on I-95, just north of I-16 in Pooler, Georgia, adjacent to the City of Savannah, and near the Savannah International Airport.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2014, our equity contributions totaled $45.2 million and our partner s equity contributions totaled $7.4 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	Contributions we make in excess of our partners' equity contributions will earn a preferred rate of return equal to 8% from the date the contributions are made until the outlet center s grand opening date, and then 10% annually thereafter.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The joint venture has an interest only mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $93.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	The loan initially matures on May 21, 2017, with two , one -year extension options.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the balance on the loan was $25.5 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	In November 2014, the joint venture completed approximately 50,000 square feet of a 78,000 square foot expansion of the existing property which upon completion will bring the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 409,000 square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The remaining square footage is expected to be completed and opened in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Construction commenced on the expansion during the second quarter of 2014 and was funded with borrowings under the amended Westgate mortgage loan.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	In May 2014, the joint venture amended and restated the initial construction loan to increase the amount available to borrow from $48.3 million to $62.0 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	The amended and restated loan matures in June 2015 with the option to extend the maturity date for two additional years.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P23_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , the balance on the loan was $54.0 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments, including a site located in Columbus, Ohio, as well as the planned expansion of our outlet center in National Harbor, Maryland.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	These two projects, if developed, will be undertaken by joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future projects will ultimately be developed.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flow from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a private buyer to sell our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon along with an option agreement for the buyer to purchase an additional four properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Subsequently, the buyer purchased the Lincoln City outlet center in December 2014 and we received net proceeds of approximately $39.0 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	The buyer now has the option to purchase three properties during the first quarter of 2015 and, should it acquire those properties, one additional property during the first quarter of 2016.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	The four additional properties subject to the option agreement have been classified as Rental Property Held for Sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	In February 2015, we closed on the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture that owned an outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	As a result of this transaction, we expect to record a gain of approximately $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of equity method investment and the purchase price.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers or joint venture interests that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have not entered into a binding contract and have not obtained approval from our Board of Directors to sell any additional outlet centers or joint venture interests, thus we can give no assurance that any additional sales will be completed.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	In November 2014, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The notes were priced at 99.429% of the principal amount to yield 3.819% to maturity.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.750% per annum and mature on December 1, 2024.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $246.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	On December 15, 2014, we redeemed our $250.0 million 6.15% senior notes due November 2015 primarily with funds from this offering.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	In July 2014, we entered into an amendment of our $250.0 million unsecured term loan which matures in February 2019.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	The amendment reduced the interest rate on the loan from LIBOR + 1.60% to LIBOR + 1.05%, and eliminated the prepayment penalty.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	No other material terms of the loan were amended.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Outlets are stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products, some of which are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Outlet centers enable them to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Each of our outlet centers, except one joint venture property, carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have developed long-standing relationships with many of our tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Because of our established relationships, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 749,074 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 380 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as American Eagle, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Carters, Coach Leatherware, Eddie Bauer, GAP, J. Crew, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Nike, Old Navy, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue - Off Fifth, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour and others.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2014, 2013 or 2012.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , no single tenant accounted for more than 7.7% of our leasable square feet or 4.7% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	Because many of our tenants are large, multinational manufacturers or retailers, we generally do not experience material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 91% of our total revenues in 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues in 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 34 years.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our consolidated outlet centers were 98% occupied with average tenant sales of $393 per square foot.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development, leasing and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing outlet centers, renovating and expanding selected outlet centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Future outlet centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our outlet shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe our 34 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support outlet centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 50% of the space in each outlet center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 50% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Keeping our outlet shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a re-merchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our long-standing retailer relationships and our focus on identifying emerging retailers allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	In order for our outlet centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our outlet centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, our consumer website, Internet advertising, social networks, mobile applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and August 2018 when our next significant debt maturity occurs.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our outlet centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls and full- and off-price retailers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P66_S3	Traditional full- and off-price retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers not be within a close proximity of a major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	For this reason, our outlet centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to minimize the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , we had one reportable operating segment.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	For financial information regarding our segment, see our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina where our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	As of February 1, 2015, we maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 37 consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	As of February 1, 2015, we had 289 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 37 business offices.
1004036_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	At that date, we also employed 336 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our outlet centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Such bankruptcy, or the voluntary closings of a significant amount of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders' interests.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We own partial interests in outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of terrorist attacks, war, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Consumer travel, shopping and spending habits may change.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Most shoppers use private automobile transportation to travel to our outlet centers and many of our outlet centers are not easily accessible by public transportation.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Should fuel costs increase significantly, it may reduce the number of trips to our outlet centers thus reducing the amount spent at our outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such reductions in traffic could adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Shoppers may also choose to spend a greater percentage of their disposable income to purchase goods through e-commerce channels, which could also reduce the number of trips to our outlet centers and the average amount spent per visit.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such a change in consumer spending habits could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our Canadian expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , through a co-ownership arrangement with a Canadian REIT, we have an ownership interest in four properties in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our operating results and the value of our Canadian operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the Canadian dollar.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Canadian ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, certain U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be attacked by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We use information technology systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business to provide timely service to our customers and maintain our relationships with our tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release or loss of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.
1004036_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	As a result, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results and our share price could be adversely affected.
1004036_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2015 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers totaling 11.3 million square feet located in 23 states.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in nine other outlet centers totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including four outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 24,619 to 749,074 square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	The outlet centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the outlet centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our Deer Park, New York, outlet center is the only property that represents 10% or more of our consolidated total assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	See "Properties - Significant Property" for further details.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring outlet centers, developing new outlet centers and expanding existing outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of the 36 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 30 and have ground leases on six.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the six outlet centers are located:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the outlet centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2015 :
1004036_15_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2015 .
1004036_15_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P9_S0	(1) Excludes square feet to be completed and turned over to an anchor tenant at a later date.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P10_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2015 , scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P11_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 823,000 square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P11_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2015 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P11_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P12_S0	Based on current market base rental rates, we believe we will achieve overall positive increases in our average base rental income for leases expiring in 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P12_S1	However, changes in base rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the base rents on new leases will continue to increase from current levels, if at all.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P13_S0	The following table sets forth our occupancy and average annual base rent per square foot for our consolidated properties.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P14_S0	(1) Average annual base rent per square foot is calculated on a straight-line basis including the effects of inducements and rent concessions.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P15_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P16_S0	(1) Represents the percentage of total square footage at the beginning of each year that is scheduled to expire during the respective year.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P16_S1	(2) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P17_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P18_S0	(2) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P19_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P19_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers:

1004036_15_ITEM2_P21_S0	The Deer Park, New York outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P21_S1	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, and then restructured certain aspects of the remaining one-third ownership of the property, the effects of which gave us a controlling ownership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P21_S2	With the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest, we have consolidated Deer Park in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P21_S3	Previously, Deer Park was reported within our unconsolidated portfolio of properties.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P22_S0	Tenants at the Deer Park outlet center principally conduct retail sales operations.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P22_S1	The following table shows occupancy and certain base rental information related to this property as of December 31, 2014 , and 2013 :

1004036_15_ITEM2_P24_S0	Depreciation on the outlet centers is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P24_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 33 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P24_S2	Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P24_S3	Real estate taxes assessed on this outlet center during 2014 amounted to $4.2 million.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P24_S4	Real estate taxes for 2015 are estimated to be approximately $4.3 million.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P25_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2015 , scheduled lease expirations for the Deer Park outlet center assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_15_ITEM2_P26_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not taken possession, vacant suites, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 68,000 square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P26_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2014, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.

1004036_15_ITEM2_P27_S0	The Company and the Operating Partnership are, from time to time, engaged in a variety of legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
1004036_15_ITEM2_P27_S1	Although the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

1004036_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	At December 31, 2014 , we had 36 consolidated outlet centers in 23 states totaling 11.3 million square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We also had 9 unconsolidated outlet centers in 7 states or provinces totaling 2.6 million square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The table below details our acquisitions, new developments, expansions and dispositions of consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers that significantly impacted our results of operations and liquidity from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 :
1004036_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	(1) On August 30, 2013, we acquired an additional one-third interest in Deer Park, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, for total consideration of approximately $27.9 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	As a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest, Deer Park has been consolidated in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The fair value of the net assets acquired, on a consolidated basis, totaled $83.8 million, consisting of $319.4 million in rental property and lease related intangibles, $2.3 million in other identifiable assets and liabilities, and $237.9 million in debt.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Previously Deer Park was reported within our unconsolidated portfolio of properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table provides information for our consolidated outlet centers regarding space re-leased or renewed during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively:
1004036_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	(1) Excludes Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	(2) Net average straight-line base rent is calculated by dividing the average tenant allowance costs per square foot by the average initial term and subtracting this calculated number from the average straight-line base rent per year amount.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The average annual straight-line base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net Income Net income decreased approximately $35.2 million in the 2014 period to $78.2 million compared to $113.3 million for the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The decrease in net income was due in part to the loss from the early redemption of our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the early extinguishment of debt.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	This charge was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	The net proceeds received from the sale of the property were approximately $39.0 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	We recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $7.5 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The decrease in net income was also due to a $26.0 million gain on a previously held interest in an acquired joint venture, which owned the property in Deer Park, New York, recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as $7.8 million recorded as our equity earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures related to certain transactions that occurred at Deer Park just prior to the acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Previously we owned a one-third interest in the Deer Park, New York property which was accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The acquisition of our controlling interest on August 30, 2013 required us to consolidate the property for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	As a result, our consolidated statements of operations reflect all of the revenues and expenses of Deer Park since the acquisition date including the significant depreciation and amortization associated with the property, the net effect of which was a reduction in net income.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Base Rentals Base rentals increased $21.1 million , or 8% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, as well as incremental base rental income from the expansions at our Branson, Charleston, Park City and Sevierville outlet centers in 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Termination fees, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, increased compared to the 2013 period as the average remaining term on leases terminating early in 2014 was longer than the average remaining term of the leases terminating early in 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the combined net amount of above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset totaling approximately $7.9 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The change in the amortization of above and below market lease values was primarily attributable to the amortization of the above market lease values recorded from the 2013 acquisition of the Deer Park, New York property.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals decreased $944,000 , or 8% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above their contractual breakpoints.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The decrease in percentage rentals is primarily a function of tenants renewing leases with higher base rental rates, and accordingly, higher contractual breakpoints.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the rolling twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately 2% to $393 per square foot.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $12.9 million , or 12% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	See "Property Operating Expenses" below for a discussion of the increase in operating expenses from our existing properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services increased $511,000 , or 17% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in fees recognized from unconsolidated joint ventures was due to incremental increases from our Ottawa and Charlotte outlet centers, which opened in 2014, and loan guarantee fees earned from our Westgate and Savannah joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Other Income Other income increased $216,000 , or 3% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $16.4 million , or 14% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Property operating expenses increased at existing properties due to increases in mall office operating costs and real estate taxes, as well as significantly higher snow removal costs.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million , or 14% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2014 issuance of restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the Company, the grant of performance shares under a new long term incentive plan and the grant of options to certain employees.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Also, the 2014 period included higher payroll related expenses due to the addition of new employees during 2013 and 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Acquisition Costs The 2013 period included costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property as well as costs from other potential acquisitions of operating properties that we chose not to pursue.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Abandoned Pre-Development Costs During the 2014 period, we decided to abandon two pre-development projects and as a result, we recorded a $2.4 million charge, representing the cumulative related costs.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $6.7 million , or 7% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased approximately $6.3 million , or 12% , in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period, primarily due to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in Deer Park in August 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	With the acquisition of the additional interest in Deer Park, we consolidated the property with all of the property's debt being reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and the associated interest expense being reflected in interest expense on our consolidated operating statements since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	In addition, we issued $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior, unsecured notes during the 4th quarter of 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	The proceeds from these notes repaid amounts outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit which had an interest rate of approximately 1.2%.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Gain on Sale of Real Estate In December 2014, we completed the sale of our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The net proceeds received from the sale of the property were approximately $39.0 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	We recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $7.5 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	We were not retained to provide any services to this outlet center after the sale was completed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gain on Previously Held Interest in Acquired Joint Venture In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the Deer Park property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	With the acquisition of a controlling interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Using the step acquisition approach, we recorded a gain of approximately $26.0 million, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The carrying value of our original investment in the property had been reduced over time as a result of recognizing our share of the losses generated by the property under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The losses were generally the result of depreciation and amortization expense exceeding earnings before depreciation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	In addition, a significant portion of our original investment was returned during the period in which we held the investment due to distributions made to the owners from (1) proceeds received when permanent financing was put in place, (2) proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, and (3) cash on hand immediately prior to our acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P32_S6	Accordingly, a substantial portion of the fair value of our equity interest was recognized as a gain due to the low cost basis of our equity investment balance in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we incurred property damage to our West Branch, Michigan outlet center due to a severe snow storm.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our insurance policy provides us with reimbursement for the replacement cost for the damage done to this property.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	During fiscal 2014, we recorded a casualty gain of $486,000 reflecting our expected total replacement insurance proceeds in excess of the total of the net book value written off and demolition costs incurred.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $2.0 million in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The decrease is primarily due to transactions at the Deer Park property in 2013 prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest in the property and its subsequent consolidation for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	As a part of the refinancing of the debt at Deer Park in August 2013, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	This decrease is partially offset by the incremental equity in earnings from the National Harbor outlet center and Charlotte outlet center which opened during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2014, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net Income Net income increased approximately $56.8 million in the 2013 period to $113.3 million compared to $56.5 million for the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase in net income was a result of a $28.0 million increase in operating revenues, a $26.0 million increase from a gain on a previously held interest in an acquired joint venture and a $14.3 million increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Subsequent to the third quarter of 2012, five additional outlet centers were developed or acquired by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	These increases in income were partially offset by an increase in property operating expenses of $9.9 million, increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.7 million and an increase in interest expense of $1.8 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Base Rental Base rentals increased $18.2 million, or 8%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals, incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, as well as incremental rental revenue from the expansion of one outlet center in 2012 and two outlet centers in 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third interest in the Deer Park property from one of the partners, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	As a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	we have consolidated the results of the property since the acquisition date for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	At December 31, 2013, the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset which totaled approximately $10.7 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The decrease in base rent recognized from the amortization of above and below market lease values related primarily to the amortization of net above market lease assets recorded from the Deer Park acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	In addition, several below market leases from previous acquisitions became fully amortized at the end of 2012 thus causing a decrease in base rent in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $8.5 million, or 8%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Existing property expense reimbursements increased in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period as a result of an increase in recoverable property operating expenses, a modest increase in the portfolio's overall average occupancy rate, and due to a number of leases recently executed which require a higher reimbursement amount of our operating expenses.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services increased $1.1 million, or 53%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Management, leasing and other services increased primarily from fees earned from the unconsolidated joint ventures added to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012 and from the National Harbor joint venture which opened during November 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase was partially offset by the loss of management fees from the Deer Park joint venture, which we began consolidating in August 2013 following the acquisition of our additional one-third interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other Income Other income in the 2013 period remained relatively consistent compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $9.9 million, or 9%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Property operating expenses increased at existing properties due to increases in mall office operating costs, snow removal costs, property insurance and real estate taxes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million, or 4%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	In the 2012 period general and administrative expenses included $1.3 million of compensation expense related to 45,000 common shares that vested immediately, granted to Steven B. Tanger, pursuant to an amendment to his employment contract.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Excluding this charge, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.0 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2013 grants of restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the Company and the grant of performance shares to senior officers under a new long term incentive plan.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	Also, the 2013 period included higher payroll related expenses on a comparative basis to the 2012 period due to the addition of new employees throughout 2012 and 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Acquisition Costs The 2013 period included costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property as well as costs from other potential acquisitions of operating properties that were never completed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The 2012 period included acquisition costs incurred by us related to the two acquisitions through our RioCan joint venture in November 2012.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.9 million, or 3%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased approximately $1.8 million, or 4%, in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The primary reason for the increase in interest expense was the increase in the average amount of debt outstanding from approximately $1.1 billion for the 2012 period to approximately $1.2 billion for the 2013 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	The higher debt levels outstanding were a result of fundings for additional investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in both Canada and the United States and the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in Deer Park.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Gain on Previously Held Interest in Acquired Joint Venture In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the Deer Park property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	With the acquisition of a controlling interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Using the step acquisition approach, we recorded a gain of approximately $26.0 million, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The carrying value of our original investment in the property had been reduced over time as a result of recognizing our share of the losses generated by the property under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	The losses were generally the result of depreciation and amortization expense exceeding earnings before depreciation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	In addition, a significant portion of our original investment was returned during the period in which we held the investment due to distributions made to the owners from (1) proceeds received when permanent financing was put in place, (2) proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, and (3) cash on hand immediately prior to our acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	Accordingly, a substantial portion of the fair value of our equity interest was recognized as a gain due to the low cost basis of our equity investment balance in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $14.3 million in the 2013 period compared to the 2012 period.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	The primary reasons for the increase related to transactions at the Deer Park property prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest and its subsequent consolidation for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	As a part of the refinancing of the debt at Deer Park, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P54_S5	Incremental earnings from the addition of four outlet centers held in unconsolidated joint ventures to the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2012 accounted for the remainder of the increase.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2015 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Based on our 2014 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $55.8 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	We distributed approximately $94.2 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Therefore, assets, liabilities,revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly during 2014 compared to 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	In 2014, our cash provided from operating activities was positively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures as we added three new joint venture properties and completed one significant expansion since November 2013, an increase in operating income throughout the consolidated portfolio from increases in base rental rates and an increase in operating income from the full year impact of the acquisition of a controlling interest in our Deer Park property in August 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	We have consolidated the Deer Park property's financial results since the acquisition date.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	These increases were offset by higher interest expense incurred in 2014 due to the issuance of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior, unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	The proceeds from these notes repaid amounts outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit which had an interest rate of approximately 1.2%.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	In addition, we paid a $13.1 million make whole premium and the original issue discount of $913,000 as part of the early redemption of our senior notes originally due in November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Cash used in investing activities increased during 2014 compared to 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Cash used related to our additions to rental property was higher in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period due primarily to ongoing construction of our Grand Rapids, Michigan and Foxwoods, Connecticut outlet centers, as well as expansions and renovations at existing outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	This was partially offset by the receipt of approximately $39.0 million in proceeds from the sale of our Lincoln City, Oregon outlet center in December 2014, lower amounts contributed to our unconsolidated joint ventures for the development of new properties and an increase in cash received from unconsolidated joint ventures that represented a return of investment, the most significant of which related to the Charlotte joint venture which closed on a mortgage loan during 2014 totaling $90.0 million and distributed net loan proceeds of $89.4 million equally to the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	The 2013 period included a similar transaction at our Galveston joint venture which closed on a mortgage loan during totaling $65.0 million and distributed the proceeds equally to the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash provided by financing activities increased during 2014 compared to 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the additional financing proceeds needed to fund the investments at both the consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture levels discussed in the investing activities section above.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	This increase was offset by an increase in the quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholders, an increase in the distributions to the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and amounts paid by us on behalf of certain employees related to income taxes from shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	In November 2014, we announced that Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2024 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $246.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem our $250.0 million 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	In November 2013, we announced that Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2023 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P77_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table summarizes our projects under development as of December 31, 2014 :
1004036_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	At the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, construction continued throughout 2014 on Tanger Outlets at Foxwoods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The outlet center will contain approximately 313,000 square feet and will be suspended above ground to join the casino floors of the two major hotels located within the resort.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Along with other various on-site entertainment venues, the casinos attract millions of visitors each year.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Construction originally commenced in September 2013 and currently we anticipate the outlet center will open during the second quarter of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	As of December 31, 2014, our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $1.0 million and our equity contributions totaled approximately $45.8 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	Our contributions have been funded with borrowings under our lines of credit and cash flow from operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	In addition, the joint venture has a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.3 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The loan initially matures in December 2017, with two one -year extension options.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The balance of this loan as of December 31, 2014 was $25.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 67% .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	In July 2014, we purchased land for approximately $8.0 million and commenced construction on the development of an approximately 350,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The site is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Township, Michigan with visibility from both roads.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The outlet center will be located approximately 30 miles east of Lake Michigan and its lakeside communities that are frequented by vacationers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	Currently, we anticipate the outlet center will open in the second half of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	Costs incurred as of December 31, 2014, which have been funded with borrowings under our lines of credit and cash flow from operations, totaled approximately $19.7 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	In January 2015, we purchased land for approximately $14.8 million and commenced construction on the development of an approximately 310,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The outlet center will be located less than 5 miles south of Memphis in Southaven, Mississippi at the northeast quadrant of I-69/55 and Church Road, with visibility on I-69/55.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	The outlet center is being developed through a joint venture in which we own a controlling interest and is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We have formed joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers that are currently in various stages of development in several markets.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Also, see "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	The following table summarizes our unconsolidated joint venture development projects as of December 31, 2014 :
1004036_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	(1) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than the ownership percentage indicated above, which states our legal interest in this venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flow from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a private buyer to sell our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon along with an option agreement for the buyer to purchase an additional four properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Subsequently, the buyer purchased the Lincoln City outlet center in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	The buyer now has the option to purchase three properties during the first quarter of 2015 and, should it acquire those properties, one additional property during the first quarter of 2016.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	The four additional properties subject to the option agreement have been classified as Rental Property Held for Sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	In February 2015, we closed on the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture that owned an outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	As a result of this transaction, we expect to record a gain of approximately $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the purchase price.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Proceeds generated by the sale of assets or joint venture interests, if completed, will be used to fund the development projects discussed above, pay down outstanding debt and/or for other general corporate purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	We have not entered into a binding contract and have not obtained approval from our Board of Directors to sell any additional outlet centers or joint venture interests, thus we can give no assurance that any additional sales will be completed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , unsecured borrowings represented 81% of our outstanding debt and 74% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1.00%.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line and a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	The syndicated line may be increased to $750.0 million through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S4	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of October 24, 2017 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P94_S5	The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations under these lines.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	In December 2014, the joint venture closed on a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.3 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The loan initially matures on December 2017, with two one -year extension options.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	The balance of this loan as of December 31, 2014 was $25.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	In July 2014, we entered into an amendment of our $250.0 million unsecured term loan, which matures in February 2019.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	The amendment reduced the interest rate on the loan from LIBOR + 1.60% to LIBOR + 1.05% , and the prepayment penalty was removed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	No other material terms of the loan were amended.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	In November 2014, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2024 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	The notes were priced at 99.429% of the principal amount to yield 3.819% to maturity.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.750% per annum and mature on December 1, 2024.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $246.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem our $250.0 million 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Deer Park, we assumed a $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The loan has a 5 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.50%.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30%, creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	In October 2013, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity, and reducing the overall borrowing costs.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The maturity of these facilities was extended from November 10, 2015 to October 24, 2017 with the ability to further extend the maturity for an additional year at our option.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	The annual commitment fee, which is payable on the full $520.0 million in loan commitments, was reduced from 0.175% to 0.15%, and the interest rate spread over LIBOR was reduced from 1.10% to 1.00% based on our current credit rating.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	In November 2013, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership completed a public offering of $250 million in senior notes due 2023 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	The notes were priced at 98.360% of the principal amount to yield 4.076% to maturity.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.875% per annum and mature on December 1, 2023.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P100_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P100_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven-year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The term loan is interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	Based on our credit ratings at that time, and until amended in July 2014, the loan had an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60%.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	See "2014 Transactions" above for discussion of the amendment.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	New outlet center development expenditures, which includes first generation tenant allowances, included construction expenditures for our outlet centers in Grand Rapids, Michigan and at the Foxwoods Resort and Casino in Connecticut in the 2014 period and expansions at our Charleston, South Carolina, Branson, Missouri, Sevierville, Tennessee, and Park City, Utah outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	The 2013 period included costs for an expansion at our Gonzales, Louisiana and Sevierville, Tennessee outlet centers and the initial development costs associated with the construction of our outlet center at the Foxwoods Resort and Casino in Connecticut.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Major outlet center renovations in the 2014 period included construction activities at our Riverhead, New York outlet center and our Rehoboth Beach, Delaware outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	The 2013 period included renovation activities at our Gonzales, Louisiana outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2014 was used.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	(3) As part of the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Deer Park, we and the noncontrolling interest have entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million, and we have the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	Due to the other owner's ability to require us to purchase their interest, we have recorded an obligation to redeem their interest at the redemption price as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of the balance sheet.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have commitments of $54.6 million remaining as of December 31, 2014 related to contracts to complete construction and development activity at outlet centers throughout our consolidated portfolio.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $25.7 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S4	Our portion of contractual commitments to complete construction and development activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to approximately $25.7 million at December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P109_S5	In addition, our portion of commitments related to tenant allowances at our unconsolidated joint ventures totaled approximately $7.8 million as of December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our debt agreements contain covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	We believe our most restrictive financial covenants are contained in our senior, unsecured notes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	Based on our 2014 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $55.8 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	We distributed approximately $94.2 million to shareholders which significantly exceeds our required distributions.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2014 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than the ownership percentage indicated above, which in this case, states our legal interest in this venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	(2) The negative carrying value is due to the distributions of proceeds from a mortgage loan, as well as quarterly distributions of excess cash flow, exceeding the original contributions from the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	In addition, the joint venture agreements contain other provisions where a venture partner can force the other partners to either buy or sell their investment in the joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Should this occur, we may be required to sell the outlet center to the venture partner or incur a significant cash outflow in order to maintain ownership of these outlet centers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	We provide guarantees to lenders for our joint ventures which include standard non-recourse carve out indemnifications for losses arising from items such as but not limited to fraud, physical waste, payment of taxes, environmental indemnities, misapplication of insurance proceeds or security deposits and failure to maintain required insurance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	For construction and term loans, we may include a guaranty of completion as well as a principal guaranty ranging from 5% to 100% of principal.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	The principal guarantees include terms for release based upon satisfactory completion of construction and performance targets including occupancy thresholds and minimum debt service coverage tests.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P117_S3	Our joint ventures may contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees.

1004036_15_ITEM7_P121_S2	The loan still carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P121_S3	At the closing of the amendment, the joint venture distributed approximately $19.0 million equally between the partners.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P121_S4	The loan balance as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $83.7 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	We are providing property management, marketing and leasing services to the joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	We have entered into a 50 /50 co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	Under the agreement, any outlet centers developed or acquired will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services for the outlet centers and RioCan has agreed to provide development and property management services.

1004036_15_ITEM7_P131_S4	The amended and restated loan matures in June 2015 with the option to extend the maturity date for two additional years.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P131_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , the balance on the loan was $54.0 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Westgate outlet center opened in November 2012 and was developed through, and currently owned by, a joint venture that was formed in May 2012.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	We are providing property management, construction supervision, marketing and leasing services to the joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Wisconsin Dells outlet center opened in August 2006 as was developed through, and currently owned by, a joint venture that was formed in March 2005.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	In December 2012, the joint venture closed on the refinance of its $24.3 million mortgage loan.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P133_S2	The refinanced interest-only, non-recourse mortgage loan has a 10 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 2.25% .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	We are providing property management, marketing and leasing services to the joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	In February 2015, we closed on the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture that owned an outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	As a result of this transaction, we expect to record a gain of approximately $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the purchase price.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	The following table details information regarding the outstanding debt of the unconsolidated joint ventures and guarantees of such debt provided by the us as of December 31, 2014 (in millions):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	Fees we received for various services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P141_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P141_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P143_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P143_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P143_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	We capitalize costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and salaries and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P147_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P147_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P147_S4	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures with qualifying development activities.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P148_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized includes amounts paid to third-party brokers and salaries and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P148_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P150_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P150_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P151_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P151_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P155_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P155_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (the "Final Standard").
1004036_15_ITEM7_P156_S1	Under the Final Standard, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations ( e.g. , a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	Under current United States General Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), companies that sell a single investment property are generally required to report the sale as a discontinued operation, which requires the companies to reclassify earnings from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	The Final Standard is effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public entities with calendar year ends.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	The FASB will permit early adoption of the Final Standard, beginning in the first quarter of 2014, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a private buyer to sell our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon along with an option agreement for the buyer to purchase an additional four properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P158_S1	Subsequently, the buyer purchased the Lincoln City outlet center in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P158_S2	The buyer now has the option to purchase three properties during the first quarter of 2015 and, should it acquire those properties, one additional property during the first quarter of 2016.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P158_S3	The four additional properties subject to the option agreement have been classified as rental property held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and their results of operations have remained in continuing operations for both the sold and held for sale rental properties.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P158_S4	See Note 4 Disposition of Properties and Properties Held for Sale of the consolidated financial statements for further information.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P159_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P159_S2	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P159_S3	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	Funds From Operations ("FFO") represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P163_S2	In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted common shares not considered participating securities, and notional units.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	(3) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interests are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P168_S2	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	We present Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P169_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	In addition, we use AFFO, or some form of AFFO, when certain material, unplanned transactions occur, as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P173_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	(1) Includes our share of acquisition costs, litigation settlement proceeds, abandoned development costs and gain on early extinguishment of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, includes a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million and litigation settlement proceeds of $3.2 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P175_S2	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted shares not considered participating securities, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P175_S3	(3) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	We present Same Center Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ( Same Center NOI - Cash Basis ) as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	We define Same Center NOI - Cash Basis as total operating revenues less property operating expenses for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, renovated or subject to a material, non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis also excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on the sale of outparcels recognized during the periods presented.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis is used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure operating performance of our properties because it provides a performance measure directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	Because Same Center NOI - Cash Basis excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as termination fees and the non-cash adjustments described above, it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P177_S2	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Center Net Operating Income, and accordingly, our Same Center NOI - Cash Basis may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	Below is a reconciliation of income before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures to Same Center NOI (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent and net above and below market rent amortization.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	(2) Excluded from Same Center NOI are the following: b. West Branch - portion of outlet center temporarily closed during 2014 due to damage caused by severe snow storm.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P181_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	During 2014 , approximately 1.6 million square feet, or 14% , of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.5 million square feet, or 13%, of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2015 .
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S2	During 2014 , we renewed 77% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 17% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S3	We also re-tenanted 470,000 square feet at a 36% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P184_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States and Canada, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P185_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 7.7% of our square feet or 4.7% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P185_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_15_ITEM7_P185_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 98% and 99%, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We typically reinvest net cash flow from our Canadian joint ventures to fund future Canadian development activity.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P1_S7	We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Deer Park, we assumed a $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The loan has a 5 year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.50%.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30%, creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S5	At December 2014 , the fair value of these contracts was $95,000 .
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates, remaining term to maturity and our credit standing.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , 27% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates, excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $3.9 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion , respectively, and its recorded value was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.3 billion , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2014 and 2013 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately $ 58.3 million and $ 46.3 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	With the exception of the unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, that have variable rates and considered at market value, fair values of the senior notes and mortgage loans are determined using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Because the Company's senior unsecured notes are publicly traded with limited trading volume, these instruments are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In contrast, mortgage loans are classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr. (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2014 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	(c) There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Vice President and Treasurer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr. (Principal Financial Officer) of Tanger GP Trust, sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2014 and concluded that, as of that date, the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the registrant is required to disclose in its filings with the Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the registrant's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Operating Partnership's board of trustees, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P12_S1	The Operating Partnership's management, with the participation of the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Operating Partnership's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P14_S0	The Operating Partnership's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Operating Partnership's management has concluded that the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2014 .

1004036_15_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_15_ITEM9A_P16_S0	The effectiveness of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

1004036_15_ITEM12_P1_S0	The table below provides information as of December 31, 2014 with respect to compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P2_S0	For each common share issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P2_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P3_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "common shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P4_S0	(1) Includes (a) 370,500 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options (52,600 of which are vested and exercisable), (b) 315,150 restricted common shares that may be issued under the 2013 Outperformance Plan (the "2013 OPP") upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and (c) 329,700 restricted common shares that may be issued under the 2014 Outperformance Plan (the "2014 OPP") upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P4_S1	Because there is no exercise price associated with the 2013 and 2014 OPP awards, such restricted common shares are not included in the weighted average exercise price calculation.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P5_S0	(2) Represents common shares available for issuance under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan.
1004036_15_ITEM12_P6_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan, the Company may award restricted common shares, restricted share units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, deferred shares, deferred share units, share payments profit interests, and share appreciation rights.

1004036_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we owned and operated 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.3 million square feet.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P89_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	These outlet centers were 98% occupied and contained over 2,400 stores, representing approximately 380 store brands.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in 9 outlet centers totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company, through its ownership of Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 95,509,781 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the "Non-Company LPs") collectively owned 5,078,406 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S4	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P92_S5	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	We evaluate our real estate joint ventures in accordance with the Consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC").
1004036_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that our Westgate and Savannah joint ventures are Variable Interest Entities ("VIE") and none of our other joint ventures are VIEs.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	Westgate and Savannah are each considered a VIE because the voting rights are disproportionate to the economic interests.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	After making the determination that Westgate and Savannah are VIEs, we performed an assessment to determine if we would be considered the primary beneficiary and thus be required to consolidate the balance sheets and results of operations.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	This assessment was based upon whether we had the following:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The operating, development, leasing, and management agreements of Westgate and Savannah provide that the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the ventures require unanimous consent.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	Accordingly, we determined that we do not have the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the ventures and therefore, have applied the equity method of accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P96_S2	Our investment in Westgate was approximately $14.3 million and in Savannah was approximately $46.5 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P96_S3	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and based on the future operating performance of Westgate and Savannah.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Non-Company LPs percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	Estimates are used in the calculations of impairment losses, costs capitalized to originate operating leases, costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, and the values of deferred lease costs and other intangibles related to the acquisition of properties.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Operating Segments - We focus exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the outlet centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	We also capitalize other costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and salaries and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties, which during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 amounted to $1.6 million , $2.2 million and $1.8 million , respectively, is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures with qualifying development activities.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	Interest costs capitalized during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 amounted to approximately $5.1 million , $1.6 million and $1.2 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P107_S3	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in net income for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $80.1 million , $74.7 million and $73.7 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 33 years.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P109_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P109_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P110_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P110_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	As a part of acquisition accounting, the amount by which the fair value of our previously held equity method investment exceeds the carrying book value is recorded as a gain on previously held interest in acquired joint venture.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Direct costs to acquire existing outlet centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $671,000 and $670,000 , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including amounts paid to third-party brokers and salaries and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases, during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were approximately $6.2 million , $4.0 million and $5.1 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P116_S2	Of the amounts capitalized during 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately $5.1 million , $2.9 million , and $4.5 million , respectively, were related to salaries and related costs.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P116_S3	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P116_S4	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	We have a wholly-owned captive insurance company that is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	We recognized no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	We believe there are no unrecorded impairment losses as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	Rental Property Held For Sale - Rental properties designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	We classify rental property as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P121_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P122_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P124_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P124_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P125_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P126_S6	The tax years 2011 - 2014 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	With regard to the Company's unconsolidated Canadian joint ventures, deferred tax assets result principally from depreciation deducted under GAAP that exceed capital cost allowances claimed under Canadian tax rules.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	A valuation allowance is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	We have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as we believe none of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were taxable as follows:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1004036_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded in other assets were approximately $34.6 million and $30.9 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P133_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P133_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P133_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	We receive development, leasing, loan guarantee, management and marketing fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates for services provided to properties held in joint ventures.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P135_S1	Development fees are recognized as revenue when earned over the development period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals, and are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P136_S1	Profits from development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third-party partners' ownership interest.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P136_S2	Profits earned to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	Loan guarantee fees are recognized over the term of the guarantee.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues (as defined in the management agreement) and are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P137_S2	Marketing fees are charged as a percentage of marketing expenses incurred by the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P137_S3	Fees recognized from these activities are shown as m anagement, leasing and other services in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P137_S4	Fees received from consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	Expenditures for these items included in trade payables as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 amounted to $23.0 million , $9.8 million and $7.1 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Non-cash investing activities that occurred during 2014 related to the acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest in The Outlets at Hershey, as discussed in Note 3.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	In the In September 2011, we purchased substantially all of the economic interests in The Outlets at Hershey, a 248,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P142_S1	A portion of the cash consideration paid to the buyer included a $6.2 million loan, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, collateralized by their remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P142_S2	In October 2014, the loan was canceled in exchange for this remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	Non-cash financing activities that occurred during the 2013 period related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Deer Park, as discussed in Note 3, included the assumption of debt totaling $237.9 million , and the issuance of $14.0 million in Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership as a portion of the consideration given.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	In addition, rental property and lease related intangible assets increased by $27.9 million related to the fair value of the one-third interest owned by Deer Park's other remaining partner and $26.0 million related to the fair value of our previously held interest in excess of carrying amount.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	Interest paid, net of interest capitalized, in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $55.4 million , $48.0 million and $46.8 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We may issue non-qualified options and other equity-based awards under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan (the "Incentive Award Plan").
1004036_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Foreign Currency Translation - We have entered into a co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada for which the functional currency is the local currency.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	The assets and liabilities related to our investments in Canada are translated from their functional currency into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P146_S2	Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P146_S3	Our share of unrealized gains and losses resulting from the translation of these financial statements are reflected in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	No. 2014-17, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting" ("ASU 2014-17").
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	ASU 2014-17 provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	The acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	If pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period as a change in accounting principle in accordance with ASC Topic 250, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections".
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S4	If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S5	ASU 2014-17 also requires an acquired entity that elects the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements to disclose information in the current reporting period that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S6	We have adopted the amendments in ASU 2014-17, effective November 18, 2014, as the amendments in the update are effective upon issuance.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P147_S7	The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P148_S2	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (the "Final Standard").
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	Under the Final Standard, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations ( e.g. , a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	Under current GAAP, companies that sell a single investment property are generally required to report the sale as a discontinued operation, which requires the companies to reclassify earnings from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S3	The Final Standard is effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public entities with calendar year ends.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S4	The FASB will permit early adoption of the Final Standard, beginning in the first quarter of 2014, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S5	We early adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S6	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a private buyer to sell our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon along with an option agreement for the buyer to purchase an additional four properties.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S7	Subsequently, the buyer purchased the Lincoln City outlet center in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S8	The buyer now has the option to purchase three properties during the first quarter of 2015 and, should it acquire those properties, one additional property during the first quarter of 2016.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S9	The four additional properties subject to the option agreement have been classified as rental property held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and their results of operations have remained in continuing operations for both the sold and held for sale rental properties.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P149_S10	See Note 4 Disposition of Properties and Properties Held for Sale for further information.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P150_S2	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P150_S3	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	In August 2013, the Operating Partnership's operating agreement was amended to, among other things, effect a four -for-one split of the outstanding partnership units After the effect of the split, each Class A common limited partnership unit held by Non-Company LPs may be exchanged for one common share of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	Prior to the split, each unit held by the Non-Company LPs was exchangeable for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P151_S2	All references to the number of units outstanding and per unit amounts reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	Reclassifications - The amount related to construction trade payables on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 has been reclassified to the caption "accounts payable and accrued expenses" from the caption "construction trade payables" to conform to the presentation of the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	We have reclassified $3.1 million and $2.0 million related to management, leasing and other services in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to the caption "management, leasing and other services" from the caption "other income" to conform to the presentation of the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	In addition, we have reclassified certain amounts related to interest income and other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 to the caption "interest and other income" from the caption "other income" to conform to the presentation of the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	In September 2011, we purchased substantially all of the economic interests in The Outlets at Hershey, a 248,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P155_S1	A portion of the cash consideration paid to the buyer included a $6.2 million loan, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, collateralized by their remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P155_S2	In October 2014, the loan was canceled in exchange for this remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	In August 2013, Deer Park completed a refinancing of its existing debt and then immediately restructured the ownership whereby we acquired an additional ownership interest in the property from one of the partners which gave us a controlling interest.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P156_S1	With the acquisition of this additional interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date, and remeasured our previously held interest that was accounted for as an equity method investment.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	Prior to the acquisition, Deer Park successfully negotiated new financing of the debt obligations for the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans totaling approximately $238.5 million , with a $150.0 million mortgage loan.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	The new five year mortgage loan bears interest at a 150 basis point spread over LIBOR.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S2	The previous mortgage and mezzanine loans were in default, and as part of the refinancing, all default interest associated with the loans was waived.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S3	Utilizing funding from our existing unsecured lines of credit, we loaned approximately $89.5 million at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and due on August 30, 2020 to the Deer Park joint venture representing the remaining amount necessary to repay the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S4	As a result of the refinancing, Deer Park recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $13.8 million .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P157_S5	Our share of this gain along with our share of the income from the settlement of a lawsuit by Deer Park with a third party totaled approximately $7.8 million , which has been included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	Subsequent to the debt extinguishment, we acquired an additional one-third interest in the Deer Park property from one of the owners, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, for total consideration of approximately $27.9 million , including $13.9 million in cash and 450,576 in Class A common limited partnership units of Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, which are exchangeable for an equivalent number of the Company's common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	This transaction was accounted for as a business combination resulting in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at fair value as a result of the step acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P158_S2	Prior to the acquisition, the joint venture was considered a variable interest entity and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we did not have the ability to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the venture as a one-third owner.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P158_S3	Upon acquiring an additional one-third interest, we determined, based on the acquisition agreement and other transaction documents which amended our rights with respect to the property and our obligations with respect to the additional one-third interest, that we control the property assets and direct the property s significant activities and therefore, consolidate the property s assets and liabilities.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	The following table illustrates the fair value of the total consideration transferred and the amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	The aggregate purchase price of the property was allocated as follows:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	We incurred approximately $1.0 million in third-party acquisition costs which were expensed as incurred.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P161_S2	As a part of the acquisition accounting, we recorded a gain of $26.0 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in Deer Park.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	Following the acquisition, we and the noncontrolling interest restructured certain aspects of our ownership of the property, whereby we receive substantially all of the economics generated by the property and would have substantial control over the property's financial activities.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	We and the noncontrolling interest entered into a triple net lease agreement with a different wholly-owned subsidiary of ours which operates the property as lessee.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P162_S2	Under the new structure, we will serve as property manager and control the management, leasing, marketing and other operations of the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P162_S3	We and the noncontrolling interest will receive, in proportion to our respective ownership interests, fixed annual lease payments of approximately $2.5 million , plus an amount necessary to pay the interest expense on debt related to the property.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P162_S4	In addition, we and the noncontrolling interest have entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million , and we have the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.

1004036_15_ITEM15_P219_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem our $250.0 million 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P219_S5	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P220_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Deer Park, we assumed an $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P220_S1	The loan has a five year term and carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.50% .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P220_S2	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our floating rate debt exposure by locking the interest rate on the $150.0 million mortgage.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P220_S3	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30% , creating a contractual interest rate for the loan of 2.80% through August 2018.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P221_S0	In October 2013, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity, and reducing the overall borrowing costs.

1004036_15_ITEM15_P222_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $243.6 million .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P222_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P223_S0	2012 Transactions In February 2012, the Operating Partnership closed on a seven -year $250.0 million unsecured term loan.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P223_S1	The term loan is interest only, matures in the first quarter of 2019 and is pre-payable without penalty beginning in February of 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P223_S2	Based on our credit ratings at that time, and until amended in July 2014, the loan had an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.60% .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P223_S3	We used the net proceeds of the term loan to reduce the outstanding balances on our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P224_S0	Maturities of the existing long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P225_S0	The following table summarizes the terms and fair values of our derivative financial instruments, as well as their classifications within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P226_S0	The derivative financial instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, each with a separate counterparty.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P226_S1	We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently do not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P227_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P227_S1	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, if any, is recognized directly in earnings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	The following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	In 2005, we settled two US treasury rate lock agreements associated with a 10 year senior, unsecured bond offering and received approximately $3.2 million .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P229_S1	The unamortized balance of the settled agreements as of December 31, 2013 was $741,000 .
1004036_15_ITEM15_P229_S2	We fully amortized the remaining balance during 2014 in connection with the early redemption of the associated 10 year senior, unsecured notes in December 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	Fair value guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P230_S1	These tiers are defined as follows:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	Fair value as of December 31, 2014:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	The estimated fair value of our debt, consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit, at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, and its recorded value was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P233_S1	With the exception of the unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, that have variable rates and considered at market value, fair values of the senior notes and mortgage loans are determined using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	Because the Company's senior unsecured notes are publicly traded with limited trading volume, these instruments are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P234_S1	In contrast, mortgage loans are classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P235_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , Non-Company LPs exchanged a total of 66,606 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P237_S1	After the above described exchanges, the Non-Company LPs owned 5,078,406 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P237_S2	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one common share of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, Non-Company LPs exchanged a total of 67,428 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P238_S1	After the above described exchanges, the Non-Company LPs owned 5,145,012 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, Non-Company LPs exchanged a total of 6,730,028 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	In August 2013, the Operating Partnership's operating agreement was amended to, among other things, effect a four -for-one split of the outstanding partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	After the effect of the split, each Class A common limited partnership unit held by Non-Company LPs may be exchanged for one common share of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P240_S2	Prior to the split, each unit held by the Non-Company LPs was exchangeable for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P240_S3	All references to the number of units outstanding and per unit amounts reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	All units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership have equal rights with respect to earnings, dividends and net assets.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P241_S1	When the Company issues common shares upon the exercise of options, the issuance of restricted share awards or the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding Class B common limited partnership unit to Tanger LP trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Also, in August 2013 as disclosed in Note 3, the Operating Partnership issued 450,576 Class A common limited partnership units as partial consideration for the acquisition of an additional one-third interest in Deer Park.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P243_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in outstanding partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1004036_15_ITEM15_P244_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Non-Company LPs as discussed in Note 2.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P244_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P245_S0	As discussed in Note 12, Non-Company LPs exchanged during 2014 a total of 66,606 Class A Common limited partnership units for an equal number of common shares of the Company, and during 2013 a total of 67,428 Class A common limited partnership units for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P245_S1	Therefore, the Company recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital of $741,000 during 2014 and $11.1 million in 2013 to reflect the transfer of ownership interests from a noncontrolling unit holder to a shareholder of the Company's common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P245_S2	The changes in the Company's ownership interests in the subsidiaries impacted consolidated equity during the periods shown as follows:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P246_S0	(1) In 2014 and 2013, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were made as a result of increases in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon exercise of options, share-based compensation and the issuance of common shares upon exchange of Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P247_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1004036_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	Notional units granted in 2010 were converted into 933,769 restricted common shares in January 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P248_S2	The restricted common shares vested on December 31, 2014 and were considered participating securities through the vesting date.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P249_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, 259,000 options and 17,600 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P249_S2	There were no options excluded from the computation for the year end December 31, 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P250_S0	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P251_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P251_S1	The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P251_S2	Unvested restricted common shares that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P252_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except per unit amounts).
1004036_15_ITEM15_P252_S1	Note that all per unit amounts reflect a four -for-one split of the Operating Partnership's units in August 2013:
1004036_15_ITEM15_P253_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P253_S1	Notional units granted in 2010 were converted into 933,769 restricted common units in January 2014.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P253_S2	The restricted common units vested on December 31, 2014 and were considered participating securities through the vesting date.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P254_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P255_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P255_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, 259,000 options and 17,600 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P255_S2	There were no options excluded from the computation for the year end December 31, 2013.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P256_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P256_S1	The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P256_S2	Unvested restricted common units that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P257_S0	We have a shareholder approved equity-based compensation plan, the Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (Amended and Restated as of April 4, 2014) (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P258_S0	For each common share issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P258_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P259_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P260_S0	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P260_S1	Through December 31, 2014 , we had granted 7,583,960 options, net of options forfeited; 4,573,683 restricted common share awards, net of restricted common shares forfeited or withheld for employees' tax obligations; and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 644,850 common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P260_S2	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 2,597,507 common shares.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P261_S0	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors).
1004036_15_ITEM15_P262_S0	In February 2014, the Company granted 282,500 options to non-executive employees of the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P262_S1	The exercise price of the options granted during the first quarter of 2014 was $32.02 which equaled the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P262_S2	The options expire 10 years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P262_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield 2.8% ; expected life of 7 years; expected volatility of 32% ; a risk-free rate of 2.46% ; and forfeiture rates of 3.0% to 13.5% dependent upon the employee's position within the Company.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P263_S0	In February 2014 and 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2014 Outperformance Plan (the 2014 OPP") and the 2013 Outperformance Plan (the 2013 OPP").
1004036_15_ITEM15_P263_S1	The 2014 OPP and 2013 OPP are long-term performance based incentive compensation plans pursuant to which award recipients may earn up to an aggregate of 329,700 and 315,150 restricted common shares, respectively, of the Company based on the Company s absolute share price appreciation (or total shareholder return) and its share price appreciation relative to its peer group over a three year measurement period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P263_S2	The measurement period for the 2014 OPP is January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 and for the 2013 OPP is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P264_S0	Any shares earned at the end of the three year measurement period are subject to a time based vesting schedule, with 50% of the shares vesting in the January immediately following the measurement period, and the remaining 50% vesting in January one year thereafter, contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the vesting dates (unless terminated prior thereto (a) by the Company without cause, (b) by participant for good reason or (c) due to death or disability.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P265_S0	The maximum number of shares will be earned under these plans if the Company both (a) achieves 35% or higher share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid, over the respective three -year measurement periods and (b) is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the respective three -year measurement periods.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P265_S1	The maximum value of the awards that could be earned on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, if the Company achieves or exceeds the 35% share price appreciation and is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the applicable three -year measurement period, will equal approximately $13.3 million and $14.3 million , respectively.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P266_S0	With respect to 70% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 25% over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period equals 30% , and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 35% or higher.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P267_S0	With respect to 30% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 50th percentile of its peer group over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 60th percentile of its peer group during this period, and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 70th percentile of its peer group or greater during this period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P267_S1	The peer group will be based on the SNL Equity REIT index.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P268_S0	The performance shares will convert on a pro-rata basis by linear interpolation between share price appreciation thresholds, both for absolute share price appreciation and for relative share price appreciation amongst the Company's peer group.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P268_S1	The share price targets will be reduced on a penny-for-penny basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P268_S2	The compensation expense is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P268_S3	The fair value of the awards are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P269_S0	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the Company granted 373,960 , 349,373 and 346,000 restricted common shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P269_S1	The independent directors' restricted common shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted common shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P269_S2	For the restricted shares issued to our chief executive officer during 2014 and 2013, the restricted share agreement requires him to hold the shares for a minimum of three years following each applicable vesting date thereof.
1004036_15_ITEM15_P269_S3	Compensation expense related to the amortization of the deferred compensation is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the restricted shares.

1004036_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our partner.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	Accordingly, we expect our current economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 67% .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P6_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P6_S8	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	In December 2014, the consolidated joint venture closed on a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.3 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .

1004036_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	In November 2012, we opened our Westgate outlet center, located in Glendale, Arizona, which was developed through, and currently owned by, a joint venture that was formed in May 2012.

1004036_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Construction commenced on the expansion during the second quarter of 2014 and was funded with borrowings under the amended Westgate mortgage loan.

1004036_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned preferred equity contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our equity partner.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based at depreciated book value, our estimated economic interest in the venture was approximately 98% .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P16_S5	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	In May 2014, the joint venture closed on a construction loan with the ability to borrow up to $97.7 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .

1004036_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	The construction of the center is currently being funded with equity contributions from the partners.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we and our partner had each contributed $20.6 million to fund development activities .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the outlet center located in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	During 2015, we sold five outlet centers for net proceeds of approximately $149.1 million , and recognized a gain of approximately $106.7 million .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	The outlet centers were located in Kittery, Maine (two centers); Tuscola, Illinois; West Branch, Michigan; and Barstow, California.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2015, approximately $121.3 million of these proceeds were held by a qualified intermediary and thus have been classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	During January 2016, we used a portion of these proceeds along with amounts under our unsecured lines of credit:
1004036_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	To repay a $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan and a $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which are related to our 749,000 square foot outlet center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	These transactions allowed us to unencumber the Deer Park asset while simultaneously deferring a significant portion of the gains related to the asset sales for tax purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	We plan on investing the remaining sales proceeds, totaling approximately $16.8 million, in qualified replacement property, including the ongoing construction of our wholly-owned new outlet center development project in Daytona Beach.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	In January 2016, we sold our outlet center in Fort Myers, Florida located near Sanibel Island for net proceeds of approximately $25.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We estimate the gain to be recognized in the first quarter of 2016 to be approximately $4.9 million .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	The proceeds from the sale of this unencumbered asset were used to pay down balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers or joint venture interests that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have not entered into a binding contract and have not obtained approval from our Board of Directors to sell any additional outlet centers or joint venture interests, thus we can give no assurance that any additional sales will be completed.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	In connection with the acquisition of the Deer Park property in 2013, we and the noncontrolling interest entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million , and we had the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	On September 30, 2015, the noncontrolling interest in our Deer Park outlet center exercised its right to require us to acquire its ownership interest.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the obligation to acquire its interest was recorded as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	The transaction closed on January 5, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line and a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	In October 2015, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity and reducing our interest rate.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	The maturity date of these facilities was extended from October 2017 to October 2019 with the ability to further extend the maturity date for an additional year at our option.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR + 1.00% to LIBOR + 0.90% based on our current credit rating and the maximum borrowings to which the syndicated line could be increased through an accordion feature in certain circumstances was increased from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P27_S5	Loan origination costs associated with the amendments totaled approximately $2.0 million .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	In October 2015, our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, voted to expand, effective January 1, 2016, the number of positions on the Company's board of directors from eight to nine and elected David B. Henry as a director to fill the vacancy, effective January 1, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Mr. Henry is the recently retired Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Kimco Realty Corporation.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	Mr. Henry will serve as a director until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected and qualified.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	In October 2015, Frank C. Marchisello, Jr., the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Vice President and Treasurer of the Operating Partnership, notified us that he will retire, effective May 20, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	James F. Williams, the Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company and the Vice President and Assistant Treasurer of the Operating Partnership will succeed Mr. Marchisello as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Vice President and Treasurer of the Operating Partnership effective May 20, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Outlets are stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products, some of which are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Outlet centers enable them to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that outlet centers will continue to present attractive opportunities for capital investment in the long-term.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	We further believe, based upon our contacts with present and prospective tenants that many companies will continue to utilize the outlet concept as a profitable distribution vehicle.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	However, due to present economic conditions and the potential for increased competition from other developers announcing plans to develop outlet centers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Each of our outlet centers, except one joint venture property, carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have established long-standing relationships with many of our tenants that we believe is critical in developing and operating successful outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 749,074 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as American Eagle Outfitters, Banana Republic Factory Store, Barneys New York, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach, Gap Outlet, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss Factory Store, J. Crew, Kate Spade New York, Lululemon Athletica, Michael Kors, Nike Factory Store, North Face, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour, Victoria s Secret, Vineyard Vines and others.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , no single tenant accounted for more than 7.5% of our leasable square feet or 6.0% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	Because many of our tenants are large, multinational manufacturers or retailers, we generally do not experience material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 91% of our total revenues in 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues in 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 35 years.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , our consolidated outlet centers were 97% occupied with average tenant sales of $395 per square foot.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development, leasing and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing outlet centers, renovating and expanding selected outlet centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	Future outlet centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our outlet shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe our 35 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support outlet centers with approximately 90 stores totaling at least 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 50% of the space in each outlet center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 50% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Keeping our outlet shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a re-merchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our long-standing retailer relationships and our focus on identifying emerging retailers allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and domestic goods.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	In order for our outlet centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our outlet centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, our consumer website, Internet advertising, social networks, mobile applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unit holders.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and 2019 when our next significant debt maturity occurs.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our outlet centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls, full-and off-price retailers and to a certain extent e-commerce retailers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Traditional full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers not be within a close proximity of a major department store or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	For this reason, our outlet centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to minimize the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , and 2014 , we had one reportable operating segment.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	For financial information regarding our segment, see our Consolidated Financial Statements.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina where our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	As of February 1, 2016, we maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 37 consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	As of February 1, 2016, we had 291 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 37 business offices.
1004036_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	At that date, we also employed 334 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Dispositions may not achieve anticipated results.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we may strategically dispose of assets with the goal of improving the overall performance of our core portfolio.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	However, we may not achieve the results we originally anticipated at the time of disposition.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we are not successful at achieving the anticipated results, there is a potential for a significant adverse impact on our returns and our overall profitability.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks, whether in the United States, Canada or elsewhere, or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending, and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties, impair the ability of tenants to meet their obligations under their existing leases, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are entirely dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if rental rates at our centers decrease, if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our outlet centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If the sales of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Such bankruptcy, or the voluntary closings of a significant amount of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders' interests.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We own partial interests in outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of terrorist attacks, war, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Shoppers may choose to spend a greater percentage of their disposable income to purchase goods through e-commerce or other retail channels, which could reduce the number of trips to our outlet centers and the average amount spent per visit.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Such a change in consumer spending habits could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our Canadian investments may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , through a co-ownership arrangement with a Canadian REIT, we have an ownership interest in four properties in Canada.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our operating results and the value of our Canadian operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the Canadian dollar.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Canadian ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success significantly depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Although we believe we have a strong management team with relevant industry expertise, the extended loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the securities markets' view of our prospects and materially harm our business.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, our continued success and the achievement of our expansion goals are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees as we expand.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, certain U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be attacked by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We use information technology systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business to provide timely service to our customers and maintain our relationships with our tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release or loss of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.
1004036_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	As a result, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results and our share price could be adversely affected.
1004036_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2016 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 33 outlet centers totaling 11.5 million square feet located in 20 states.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in nine other outlet centers totaling approximately 2.7 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including four outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 749,074 square feet.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The outlet centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the outlet centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	The outlet center in Deer Park, New York is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	See "Properties - Significant Property" for further details.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring outlet centers, developing new outlet centers and expanding existing outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	As of February 1, 2016, of the 33 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 26 and have ground leases on seven.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the outlet centers are located:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the outlet centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2016 :
1004036_16_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2016 .
1004036_16_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P8_S1	(2) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P8_S2	We currently receive substantially all the economic interest of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P8_S3	(3) Excludes the occupancy rate at our Foxwoods, Grand Rapids and Southaven centers which opened during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively, and have not yet stabilized.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P8_S4	See note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our debt obligations.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P9_S0	(1) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than indicated in the Tanger Ownership column, which states our legal interest in this venture.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P9_S1	As of February 1, 2016, based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our estimated economic interest in the venture was approximately 98% .
1004036_16_ITEM2_P9_S2	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P10_S0	(2) Excludes square feet to be completed and turned over to an anchor tenant at a later date.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P11_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2016 , scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P12_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 863,000 square feet.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P12_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2016 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P12_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P13_S0	Based on current market base rental rates, we believe we will achieve overall positive increases in our average base rental income for leases expiring in 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P13_S1	However, changes in base rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the base rents on new leases will continue to increase from current levels, if at all.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P14_S0	The following table sets forth our year end occupancy and average annual base rent per square foot during each of the last five calendar years for our consolidated properties:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P15_S0	(1) Average annual base rent per square foot is calculated on a straight-line basis including the effects of inducements and rent concessions.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P16_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P17_S0	(1) Represents the percentage of total square footage at the beginning of each year that is scheduled to expire during the respective year.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P17_S1	(2) Excludes the outlet centers in Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch, and Barstow, which were sold during 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P17_S2	(3) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P18_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P19_S0	(2) Excludes the outlet centers in Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch, and Barstow, which were sold during 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P19_S1	(3) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P20_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P20_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five calendar years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P21_S0	Tenants The following table sets forth certain information for our consolidated outlet centers with respect to our ten largest tenants and their store concepts as of February 1, 2016 :
1004036_16_ITEM2_P22_S0	The Deer Park, New York outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P22_S1	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P22_S2	In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, and then restructured certain aspects of the remaining one-third ownership of the property, the effects of which gave us a controlling ownership interest.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P22_S3	With the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest, we have consolidated Deer Park in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P22_S4	Previously, Deer Park was reported within our unconsolidated portfolio of properties.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P23_S0	Tenants at the Deer Park outlet center principally conduct retail sales operations.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P23_S1	The following table shows occupancy and certain base rental information related to this property as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013:

1004036_16_ITEM2_P24_S1	Represents average base rental rates per weighted average square foot since the acquisition date.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P25_S0	Depreciation on the outlet centers is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P25_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 33 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P25_S2	Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P25_S3	Real estate taxes assessed on this outlet center during 2015 amounted to $4.4 million.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P25_S4	Real estate taxes for 2016 are estimated to be approximately $4.9 million.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P26_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2016 , scheduled lease expirations for the Deer Park outlet center assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_16_ITEM2_P27_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not taken possession, vacant suites, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 71,000 square feet.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P27_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2016, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P27_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P28_S0	The Company and the Operating Partnership are, from time to time, engaged in a variety of legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
1004036_16_ITEM2_P28_S1	Although the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	(1) On August 30, 2013, we acquired an additional one-third interest in Deer Park, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, for total consideration of approximately $27.9 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	As a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest, Deer Park has been consolidated in our balance sheet and statements of operations since the acquisition date.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The majority of this increase was due to gains from the sale of our equity interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, and the sales of our Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch and Barstow outlet centers, which resulted in gains totaling approximately $120.4 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, net income increased in the 2015 period primarily due to:

1004036_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals, incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, and incremental income from the expansion of our Sevierville, Branson, Park City and San Marcos outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Termination fees, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, increased in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period as a result of certain brand-wide store closures throughout our portfolio.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The 2014 period did not have any significant tenant closures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	At December 31, 2015 , the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset totaling approximately $5.9 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value would be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals decreased $150,000 , or 1% , in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $395 per square foot were flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Most, but not all, leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay a share of our operating expenses as additional rent.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	However, substantially all of the leases for our new Foxwoods outlet center, which opened in May 2015, require tenants to pay a single minimum contractual gross rent and, in certain cases, percentage rent; thus, all minimum rents received for the Foxwoods outlet center are recorded as base rent and none are recorded to expense reimbursements.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The increase in fees recognized was due to the increase in the number of unconsolidated joint ventures for which we provide services in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The majority of the increases was due to fees from the Savannah outlet center which opened in April 2015.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $3.7 million , or 6% , in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period, due to the issuance of $250 million senior notes in November 2014 which bear an interest rate of 3.75%.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The net proceeds were used in December 2014 to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes which had an original maturity of November 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes originally due November 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Gain on Sale of Assets and Interests in Unconsolidated Entities In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	In September 2015, we sold our Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch outlet centers for approximately $43.3 million , which resulted in a gain of $20.2 million and in October 2015, we sold our Barstow outlet center for approximately $105.8 million , which resulted in a gain of $86.5 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $2.4 million or 27% in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures from new developments is due to the incremental earnings from the Charlotte outlet center, which opened during the third quarter of 2014; the Ottawa outlet center, which opened during the fourth quarter of 2014; and the Savannah outlet center, which opened in April 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The equity in earnings from properties disposed are related to our equity interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, which we sold in February 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net Income Net income decreased approximately $35.2 million in the 2014 period to $78.2 million compared to $113.3 million for the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decrease in net income was due in part to the loss from the early redemption of our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the early extinguishment of debt.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	This charge was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our outlet center in Lincoln City.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S6	The net proceeds received from the sale of the property were approximately $39.0 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P37_S7	We recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $7.5 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The decrease in net income was also due to a $26.0 million gain on a previously held interest in an acquired joint venture, which owned the property in Deer Park, recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as $7.8 million recorded as our equity earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures related to certain transactions that occurred at Deer Park just prior to the acquisition.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Previously we owned a one-third interest in the Deer Park, property which was accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The acquisition of our controlling interest on August 30, 2013 required us to consolidate the property for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	As a result, our consolidated statements of operations reflect all of the revenues and expenses of Deer Park since the acquisition date including the significant depreciation and amortization associated with the property, the net effect of which was a reduction in net income.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Base Rentals Base rentals increased $21.1 million, or 8%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces, as well as incremental base rental income from the expansions at our Branson, Charleston, Park City and Sevierville outlet centers in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Termination fees, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, increased compared to the 2013 period as the average remaining term on leases terminating early in 2014 was longer than the average remaining term of the leases terminating early in 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	At December 31, 2014, the combined net amount of above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net above market lease asset totaling approximately $7.9 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The change in the amortization of above and below market lease values was primarily attributable to the amortization of the above market lease values recorded from the 2013 acquisition of the Deer Park, New York property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals decreased $944,000, or 8%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above their contractual breakpoints.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The decrease in percentage rentals is primarily a function of tenants renewing leases with higher base rental rates, and accordingly, higher contractual breakpoints.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Reported tenant comparable sales for our consolidated properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately 2% to $393 per square foot.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Reported tenant comparable sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $12.9 million, or 12%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	See "Property Operating Expenses" below for a discussion of the increase in operating expenses from our existing properties.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services increased $511,000, or 17%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	management and marketing fees recognized from unconsolidated joint ventures was due to incremental increases from our Ottawa and Charlotte outlet centers, which opened in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in loan guarantee fees was due to fees earned from our Westgate and Savannah joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other Income Other income increased $216,000, or 3%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $16.4 million, or 14%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Property operating expenses increased at existing properties due to increases in mall office operating costs and real estate taxes, as well as significantly higher snow removal costs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million, or 14%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	This increase was mainly due to additional share-based compensation expense related to the 2014 issuance of restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the Company, the grant of performance shares under a new long term incentive plan and the grant of options to certain employees.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Also, the 2014 period included higher payroll related expenses due to the addition of new employees during 2013 and 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Acquisition Costs The 2013 period included costs related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in the Deer Park property as well as costs from other potential acquisitions of operating properties that we chose not to pursue.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Abandoned Pre-Development Costs During the 2014 period, we decided to abandon two pre-development projects and as a result, we recorded a $2.4 million charge, representing the cumulative related costs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $6.7 million, or 7%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased approximately $6.3 million, or 12%, in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period, primarily due to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in Deer Park in August 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	With the acquisition of the additional interest in Deer Park, we consolidated the property with all of the property's debt being reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and the associated interest expense being reflected in interest expense on our consolidated operating statements since the acquisition date.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, we issued $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior, unsecured notes during the 4th quarter of 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	The proceeds from these notes repaid amounts outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit which had an interest rate of approximately 1.2%.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Gain on Sale of Real Estate In December 2014, we completed the sale of our outlet center in Lincoln City.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The net proceeds received from the sale of the property were approximately $39.0 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	We recorded a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $7.5 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Gain on Previously Held Interest in Acquired Joint Venture In August 2013, we acquired an additional one-third ownership interest in the Deer Park property, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	With the acquisition of a controlling interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	Using the step acquisition approach, we recorded a gain of approximately $26.0 million, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of our original equity interest.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S3	The carrying value of our original investment in the property had been reduced over time as a result of recognizing our share of the losses generated by the property under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S4	The losses were generally the result of depreciation and amortization expense exceeding earnings before depreciation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S5	In addition, a significant portion of our original investment was returned during the period in which we held the investment due to distributions made to the owners from (1) proceeds received when permanent financing was put in place, (2) proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, and (3) cash on hand immediately prior to our acquisition.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P60_S6	Accordingly, a substantial portion of the fair value of our equity interest was recognized as a gain due to the low cost basis of our equity investment balance in the property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we incurred property damage to our West Branch outlet center due to a severe snow storm.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our insurance policy provides us with reimbursement for the replacement cost for the damage done to this property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	During fiscal 2014, we recorded a casualty gain of $486,000 reflecting our expected total replacement insurance proceeds in excess of the total of the net book value written off and demolition costs incurred.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $2.0 million in the 2014 period compared to the 2013 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease is primarily due to transactions at the Deer Park property in 2013 prior to our acquisition of an additional one-third interest in the property and its subsequent consolidation for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	As a part of the refinancing of the debt at Deer Park in August 2013, a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.8 million was recorded.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	In addition a lawsuit was settled which resulted in income to Deer Park of approximately $9.5 million after expenses.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Our one-third share of these transactions, recorded through equity in earnings prior to the acquisition, was approximately $7.8 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	This decrease is partially offset by the incremental equity in earnings from the National Harbor outlet center and Charlotte outlet center which opened during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2014, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2018 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Based on our 2015 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $101.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	We distributed approximately $123.9 million, which includes a special dividend paid in January 2016, to shareholders which exceeded our required distributions.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	As the sole owner of the general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Therefore, assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Memphis outlet centers which opened in May 2015, July 2015, and November 2015, respectively, four small expansions of our consolidated properties completed during 2014, and an increase in distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures from the new centers and expansions completed in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Memphis outlet centers which opened during 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Less cash was received in 2015 compared to 2014 from unconsolidated joint ventures that represented a return of investment as the 2014 period included the distribution of $89.4 million in net loan proceeds related the Charlotte joint venture that was distributed equally to the partners.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cash provided from assets sales increased year over year as in 2015 we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center and five other properties compared to a sale of one property in 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Of the $164.6 million in proceeds received from the 2015 asset sales, approximately $121.3 million was held as restricted cash as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Contributions to our unconsolidated joint ventures for the property development activities was much less in 2015 compared to 2014 as one new joint venture project (Savannah) was under construction during the 2015 period compared to the construction of three new properties (Charlotte, Ottawa and Savannah) and two significant expansions (Cookstown and Westgate) in the 2014 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in the amounts paid by us on behalf of certain employees related to income taxes from shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The increase was offset by an increase in the quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the acquisition or disposition of properties.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P87_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	In May 2015, we opened an approximately 312,000 square foot outlet center at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $1.0 million and our equity contributions totaled approximately $58.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	Contributions we make in excess of $40.0 million earn a preferred rate of return of 15% from the date of contribution.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	In addition, each partner earns a rate of return of 10% on their initial capital contributions from the date of contribution.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S5	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our partner.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S6	Accordingly, we expect our current economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 67% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P88_S8	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	In July 2015, we opened an approximately 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The outlet center is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Township, Michigan, with visibility from both roads.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	In November 2015, we opened an approximately 320,000 square foot outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	In January 2015, we purchased land for approximately $14.8 million and commenced construction on the development of Tanger Outlets Southaven, which is located less than five miles south of Memphis, Tennessee.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $461,000 and our equity contributions totaled approximately $26.5 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	From the date our equity contributions are made, we earn a preferred rate of return of 10% for senior contributions and 14% for junior contributions.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P91_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , the balance of our senior contributions was $17.7 million and our junior contributions was $8.3 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our partner.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Accordingly, we expect our current economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 50% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	As of December 31, 2015, based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P92_S3	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table summarizes our projects under development as of December 31, 2015 :
1004036_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	In November 2015, we purchased land for approximately $9.9 million and commenced construction on the development of a wholly owned outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The outlet center is expected to be approximately 352,000 square feet and to open by Holiday 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	From time to time, we form joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The following table summarizes our unconsolidated joint venture development projects as of December 31, 2015 :
1004036_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, the joint venture purchased land for approximately $8.9 million and began construction on a 350,000 square foot outlet center in Columbus, Ohio.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	We and our partner currently expect to complete construction in time to open the center during the second quarter of 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The construction of the center is currently being funded with equity contributions from the partners.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we and our partner had each contributed $20.6 million to fund development activities .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flow from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	On September 30, 2015, the noncontrolling interest in our Deer Park outlet center exercised its right to require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property for $28.4 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The transaction closed on January 5, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The obligation to acquire its interest is recorded as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	From time to time, we may sell one or more outlet centers that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	During 2015, we sold five outlet centers for net proceeds of approximately $149.1 million , and recognized a gain of approximately $106.7 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	The outlet centers were located in Kittery, Maine (two centers); Tuscola, Illinois; West Branch, Michigan; and Barstow, California.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	As of December 31, 2015, approximately $121.3 million of these proceeds were held by a qualified intermediary and thus have been classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	During January 2016, we used a portion of these proceeds along with amounts under our unsecured lines of credit:
1004036_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	To repay a $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan and a $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which are related to our 749,000 square foot outlet center in Deer Park, New York.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	These transactions allowed us to unencumber the Deer Park asset while simultaneously deferring a significant portion of the gains related to the asset sales for tax purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	We plan on investing the remaining sales proceeds, totaling approximately $16.8 million, in qualified replacement property, including the ongoing construction of our wholly-owned new outlet center development project in Daytona Beach.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	In January 2016, we sold our outlet center in Fort Myers, Florida located near Sanibel Island for net proceeds of approximately $25.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	We estimate the gain to be recognized in the first quarter of 2016 to be approximately $4.9 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	The proceeds from the sale of this unencumbered asset were used to pay down balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , unsecured borrowings represented 80% of our outstanding debt and 75% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million, including a $20.0 million liquidity line and a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	Following the amendments in 2015 described below in the section "Extension of Unsecured Lines of Credit", our unsecured lines of credit bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 0.90% and the syndicated line may be increased to $1.0 billion through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of October 24, 2019 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P107_S4	The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations under these lines.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	In January 2016, we repaid our $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, which had an original maturity date in August 2018, and our $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which are related to our 749,000 square foot Deer Park outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	These transactions allowed us to unencumber the Deer Park asset while simultaneously deferring a significant portion of the gains related to the asset sales for tax purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	In April 2015, the consolidated joint venture closed on a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $60.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	The loan initially matures on April 29, 2018, with one two -year extension option.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	As of December 31, 2015 the balance on the loan was $45.8 million .

1004036_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	In October 2015, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity and reducing our interest rate.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	The maturity date of these facilities was extended from October 2017 to October 2019 with the ability to further extend the maturity date for an additional year at our option.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR + 1.00% to LIBOR + 0.90% based on our current credit rating and the maximum borrowings to which the syndicated line could be increased through an accordion feature in certain circumstances was increased from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P112_S3	Loan origination costs associated with the amendments totaled approximately $2.0 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	In July 2014, we entered into an amendment of our $250.0 million unsecured term loan which matures in February 2019.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	The amendment reduced the interest rate on the loan from LIBOR + 1.60% to LIBOR + 1.05% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	No other material terms of the loan were amended.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The notes were priced at 99.429% of the principal amount to yield 3.819% to maturity.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.750% per annum and mature on December 1, 2024.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P114_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $246.2 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P114_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem our $250.0 million 6.15% senior notes due November 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P114_S5	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	In December 2014, the consolidated joint venture closed on a mortgage loan with the ability to borrow up to $70.3 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	The loan initially matures in December 2017, with two one -year extension options.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	As of December 31, 2015 the balance on the loan was $70.3 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	In August 2013, as part of the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Deer Park, we assumed an $150.0 million interest only mortgage loan, including a fair value discount of $1.6 million .

1004036_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	In October 2013, to reduce our floating rate debt exposure, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling $150.0 million that fixed the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30% from November 2013 to August 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	In October 2013, we amended our unsecured lines of credit, extending the maturity, and reducing the overall borrowing costs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	The maturity of these facilities was extended from November 10, 2015 to October 24, 2017 with the ability to further extend the maturity for an additional year at our option.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P120_S4	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	New center development expenditures, which include first generation tenant allowances, relate to construction expenditures for our Grand Rapids, Southaven, and Foxwoods outlet centers in the 2015 period.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	The 2014 period included new center development expenditures for our Grand Rapids and Foxwoods outlet centers and expansions at our Charleston, Branson, Sevierville, and Park City outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Major center renovations in both the 2015 and 2014 periods included construction activities at our Riverhead and our Rehoboth Beach outlet centers.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	(3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2015 was used.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	(4) As part of the acquisition in 2013 of a controlling ownership interest in Deer Park, we and the noncontrolling interest entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million, and we had the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S4	On September 30, 2015, the noncontrolling interest in our Deer Park outlet center exercised its right to require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property for $28.4 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S5	The transaction closed on January 5, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P125_S6	The obligation to redeem their interest at the redemption price was recorded as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have commitments of $50.6 million remaining as of December 31, 2015 related to contracts to complete construction and development activity at outlet centers throughout our consolidated portfolio.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $5.4 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S4	Contractual commitments to complete construction and development activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to approximately $34.5 million at December 31, 2015 , of which our portion was approximately $17.2 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P126_S5	In addition, commitments related to tenant allowances at our unconsolidated joint ventures totaled approximately $14.4 million at December 31, 2015 , of which our portion was approximately $7.2 million .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Contractual commitments represent only those costs subject to contracts which are legal binding agreements as of December 31, 2015 and do not necessary represent the total cost to complete the projects.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	Our debt agreements contain covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	We believe our most restrictive financial covenants are contained in our senior, unsecured notes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	A REIT that distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and that meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P131_S1	Based on our 2015 taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $101.7 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P131_S2	We distributed approximately $123.9 million, which includes a special dividend paid in January 2016, to shareholders which exceeded our required distributions.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P131_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2015 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	(1) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than the ownership percentage indicated above, which in this case, states our legal interest in this venture.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	(2) The negative carrying value is due to the distributions of proceeds from mortgage loans, and quarterly distributions of excess cash flow exceeding the original contributions from the partners.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	Our joint ventures are generally subject to buy-sell provisions which are customary for joint venture agreements in the real estate industry.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	Either partner may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up period), which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or additional borrowings to acquire the other party's interest.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	Under these provisions, one partner sets a price for the property, then the other partner has the option to either (1) purchase their partner's interest based on that price or (2) sell its interest to the other partner based on that price.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P134_S3	Since the partner other than the partner who triggers the provision has the option to be the buyer or seller, we do not consider this arrangement to be a mandatory redeemable obligation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	We provide guarantees to lenders for our joint ventures which include standard non-recourse carve out indemnifications for losses arising from items such as but not limited to fraud, physical waste, payment of taxes, environmental indemnities, misapplication of insurance proceeds or security deposits and failure to maintain required insurance.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	Contributions we made in excess of our partners' equity contributions are considered preferred equity and earned a preferred rate of return equal to 8% from the date the contributions were made until the outlet center s grand opening in April 2015, and will earn 10% annually thereafter.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P146_S3	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned preferred equity contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our equity partner.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P146_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based at depreciated book value, our estimated economic interest in the venture was approximately 98% .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P146_S5	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .

1004036_16_ITEM7_P147_S5	We are providing development, management and marketing services to the joint venture; and with our partner, are jointly providing leasing services to the outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	In November 2012, we opened our Westgate outlet center, located in Glendale, Arizona, which was developed through, and currently owned by, a joint venture that was formed in May 2012.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, the joint venture completed the remaining 28,000 square feet of a 78,000 square foot expansion of the existing property which upon completion increased the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 411,000 square feet.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P149_S1	Construction commenced on the expansion during the second quarter of 2014 and was funded with borrowings under the amended Westgate mortgage loan.

1004036_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	The following table details information regarding the outstanding debt of the unconsolidated joint ventures and guarantees of such debt provided by us as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	Fees we received for various services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P155_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P155_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures in which we have a non-controlling ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	In accordance with amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which became effective January 1, 2010, we perform an analysis of all of our real estate joint ventures to determine whether they qualify as variable interest entities, ( VIE ), and whether the joint venture should be consolidated or accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated joint venture.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P157_S1	Our analysis includes our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P157_S2	We consider various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P157_S3	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P159_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P159_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P159_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P159_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	We capitalize costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and salaries and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P163_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P163_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P163_S4	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures with qualifying development activities.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P164_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized includes amounts paid to third-party brokers and salaries and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P164_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P166_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P166_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P166_S3	We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P171_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P171_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P171_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P172_S1	The guidance in the new standard is limited to the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P172_S2	The standard does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P173_S1	The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P174_S1	We do not expect t he adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P175_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P175_S2	ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P175_S3	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P175_S4	We expect that the adoption of this standard during the first quarter of 2016 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but may result in additional disclosures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P176_S1	ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P176_S2	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (the "Final Standard").
1004036_16_ITEM7_P177_S1	Under the Final Standard, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations ( e.g. , a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	Under previous GAAP, companies that sold a single investment property were generally required to report the sale as a discontinued operation, which required the companies to reclassify earnings from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	The Final Standard is effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public entities with calendar year ends.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	The FASB will permit early adoption of the Final Standard, beginning in the first quarter of 2014, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P178_S3	We early adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P178_S4	See Note 4 Disposition of Properties and Properties Held for Sale for further information.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P179_S2	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P179_S3	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	Funds From Operations ("FFO") represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P181_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	In addition, a portion of cash bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO or Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), which is described in the section below.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	We believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate our performance and that of our management.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	In addition, FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P183_S2	FFO is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P183_S3	The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P186_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	(2) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted common shares not considered participating securities, and notional units.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	(3) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interests are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S0	We use AFFO when certain material, unplanned transactions occur as a factor in evaluating management's performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and may use AFFO when determining incentive compensation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S1	We present AFFO, as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S2	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S3	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S4	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S5	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P189_S6	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P190_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P190_S1	In addition, we believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate management s performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P191_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P192_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P193_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P193_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P194_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P195_S0	(1) Represents the reversal of certain share-based compensation awards previously recognized on awards not expected to vest due to the announcement of the Company s Chief Financial Officer's pending retirement in May 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P195_S1	(2) Includes our share of acquisition costs, litigation settlement proceeds, abandoned development costs and gain on early extinguishment of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P195_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013, includes a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million and litigation settlement proceeds of $3.2 million.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P195_S3	(4) Includes the dilutive effect of options, restricted shares not considered participating securities, notional units and exchangeable notes.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P195_S4	(5) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interest are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P196_S0	Same Center Net Operating Income-Cash Basis We present Same Center Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ( Same Center NOI - Cash Basis ) as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P196_S1	We define Same Center NOI - Cash Basis as total operating revenues less property operating expenses for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired, renovated or subject to a material non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P196_S2	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis also excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on the sale of outparcels recognized during the periods presented.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P197_S0	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis is used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure operating performance of our properties because it provides a performance measure directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P197_S1	Because Same Center NOI - Cash Basis excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as non-cash adjustments, gains or losses on the sale of outparcels and termination rents; it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P197_S2	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same Center Net Operating Income, and accordingly, our Same Center NOI - Cash Basis may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P198_S0	Same Center NOI - Cash Basis should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P199_S0	Below is a reconciliation of income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures to Same Center NOI - Cash Basis (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7_P200_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P200_S1	(2) Excluded from Same Center NOI - Cash Basis: Foxwoods outlet center, which opened in May of 2015; Grand Rapids outlet center, which opened in July of 2015; Southaven outlet center, which opened in November 2015, Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in December 2014; Kittery I II, Tuscola and West Branch outlet centers, which were sold in September 2015; Barstow outlet center, which was sold in October 2015; and Fort Myers outlet center, which was sold in January 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P201_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P201_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P201_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P202_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P203_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S1	During 2015 , approximately 1.5 million square feet, or 13% , of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.4 million square feet, or 12% , of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2016 .
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S2	During 2015 , we renewed 84% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at a 20% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S3	We also re-tenanted 444,000 square feet at a 29% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P204_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P205_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P205_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States and Canada, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P205_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 7.5% of our square feet or 6.0% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P205_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_16_ITEM7_P205_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 97% and 98%, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We typically reinvest net cash flow from our Canadian joint ventures to fund future Canadian development activity.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P1_S7	We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million to reduce our floating rate debt exposure.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30% and mature in August 2018.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the fair value of these contracts is a liability of $616,000 .
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates, remaining term to maturity and our credit standing.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , 36% of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates, excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $5.6 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt of approximately $50.3 million and $58.3 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	With the exception of the unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, that have variable rates and considered at market value, fair values of the senior notes and mortgage loans are determined using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Because the Company's senior unsecured notes are publicly traded with limited trading volume, these instruments are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In contrast, mortgage loans are classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_16_ITEM9_P0_S0	The information required by this Item 9 was previously reported in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr. (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2015 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	(c) There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Vice President and Treasurer, Frank C. Marchisello Jr. (Principal Financial Officer) of Tanger GP Trust, sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2015 and concluded that, as of that date, the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the registrant is required to disclose in its filings with the Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the registrant's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Operating Partnership's board of trustees, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1004036_16_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Operating Partnership's management has concluded that the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_16_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1004036_16_ITEM12_P2_S0	For each common share issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM12_P2_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.

1004036_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P93_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company, through its ownership of Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 95,880,825 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the "Non-Company LPs") collectively owned 5,052,743 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S4	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P94_S5	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	We consolidate properties that are wholly owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIE").
1004036_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, we consolidate the entity where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P96_S3	Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P96_S4	Our determination of the primary beneficiary considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that we do not control but may exercise significant influence on are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income or loss, cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Under this method, we recognize income and loss in each period based on the change in liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	Therefore, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately as compared to the ownership percentages due to specified preferred return rate thresholds and may be more or less than actual cash distributions received and more or less than what we may receive in the event of an actual liquidation.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	In the event a basis difference is created between our underlying interest in the venture's net assets and our initial investment, we amortize such amount over the estimated life of the venture as a component of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	We separately report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income or loss of the joint ventures within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	The carrying amount of our investments in the Charlotte and Galveston/Houston joint ventures are less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that were greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	We have concluded that our Savannah and Southaven joint ventures are each considered a VIE because our voting rights are disproportionate to our economic interests and substantially all of each venture's activities either involve or are conducted on our behalf.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	Also, due to certain reconsideration events, we concluded during 2015 that our Westgate joint venture, previously considered a VIE since inception, was no longer considered a VIE.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The operating, development, leasing, and management agreements of Savannah provide that the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the venture require unanimous consent.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	Accordingly, we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary since we do not have the power to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the venture, and have applied the equity method of accounting.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P102_S2	The carrying amount of our investment in Savannah is reflected in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheets and was $44.4 million as of December 31, 2015 .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P102_S3	We are unable to estimate our maximum exposure to loss at this time because our guarantees are limited and based on the future operating performance of Savannah.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	The management agreement and other contractual arrangements for Southaven give us, but not necessarily our joint venture partner, significant participating rights over activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the ventures, thus we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and have consolidated the venture's balance sheet and results of operations.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	At December 31, 2015 , total assets of this venture were $81.5 million and total liabilities were $55.6 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P103_S2	The primary classification of the assets on the consolidated balance sheets are rental property, net of accumulated depreciation totaling $76.7 million ; cash of $1.4 million and other assets of $3.4 million (including deferred lease costs and other intangibles and deferred debt origination costs) and the primary classification of the liabilities include accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.8 million and mortgages payable of $45.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P103_S3	These assets include only those assets that can be used to settle obligations of the VIE.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P103_S4	The liabilities include third party liabilities and exclude intercompany balances that are eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Non-Company LPs percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	The "Noncontrolling Interests in Other Consolidated Partnerships" consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership but are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P104_S2	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P104_S3	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on the allocation provisions within the partnership or joint venture agreements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P105_S1	Estimates are used in the calculations of impairment losses, costs capitalized to originate operating leases, costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, and the values of deferred lease costs and other intangibles related to the acquisition of properties.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P105_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Operating Segments - We focus exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the outlet centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P108_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are charged to operations when the project is no longer probable.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	We also capitalize other costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and payroll and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P109_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties, which during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 amounted to $3.0 million , $1.6 million and $2.2 million , respectively, is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures for qualifying development activities until placed in service.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	Interest costs capitalized during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 amounted to approximately $3.4 million , $5.1 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P113_S3	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in net income for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $85.9 million , $80.1 million and $74.7 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 33 years.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P115_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P115_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P115_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P116_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P116_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	As a part of acquisition accounting, the amount by which the fair value of our previously held equity method investment exceeds the carrying book value is recorded as a gain on previously held interest in acquired joint venture.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Direct costs to acquire existing outlet centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Recoverability of investments is dependent upon the performance of the issuer.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $671,000 .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The restricted cash represents the cash proceeds from property sales that are being held by a qualified intermediary in anticipation of such amounts subsequently being invested in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including amounts paid to third-party brokers and payroll and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases, during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were approximately $7.8 million , $6.2 million and $4.0 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P123_S2	Of the amounts capitalized during 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately $6.2 million , $5.1 million , and $2.9 million , respectively, were related to payroll and related costs.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P123_S3	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P123_S4	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	We have a wholly-owned captive insurance company that is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	Fair value is determined using a market approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and sales data for transactions involving similar assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	We recognized no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	Also, we believe there were no unrecorded impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	Rental Property Held For Sale - Rental properties designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P128_S1	We classify rental property as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P128_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P129_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P129_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, discount and capitalization rates, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we do not believe that any of our equity investments were impaired.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P131_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P132_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P133_S6	The tax years 2012 - 2015 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	With regard to the Company's unconsolidated Canadian joint ventures, deferred tax assets result principally from depreciation deducted under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") that exceed capital cost allowances claimed under Canadian tax rules.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P135_S0	A valuation allowance is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P135_S1	We have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as we believe none of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were taxable as follows:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P138_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded as a receivable in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets were approximately $40.6 million and $34.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P140_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P140_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P140_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P140_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P140_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.

1004036_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	In September 2011, we purchased substantially all of the economic interests in The Outlets at Hershey, a 248,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P148_S1	A portion of the cash consideration paid to the buyer included a $6.2 million loan, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, collateralized by their remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P148_S2	In October 2014, the loan was canceled in exchange for this remaining ownership interest in the property.

1004036_16_ITEM15_P151_S2	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	Foreign Currency Translation - We have entered into a co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada for which the functional currency is the local currency.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P152_S1	The assets and liabilities related to our investments in Canada are translated from their functional currency into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P152_S2	Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P152_S3	Our share of unrealized gains and losses resulting from the translation of these financial statements are reflected in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P153_S1	The guidance in the new standard is limited to the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P153_S2	The standard does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P154_S1	The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	We do not expect t he adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P156_S2	ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P156_S3	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P156_S4	We expect that the adoption of this standard during the first quarter of 2016 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but may result in additional disclosures.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P157_S2	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (the "Final Standard").
1004036_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	Under the Final Standard, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations ( e.g. , a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	Under previous GAAP, companies that sold a single investment property were generally required to report the sale as a discontinued operation, which required the companies to reclassify earnings from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	The Final Standard is effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public entities with calendar year ends.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P159_S2	The FASB will permit early adoption of the Final Standard, beginning in the first quarter of 2014, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P159_S3	We early adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P159_S4	See Note 4 Disposition of Properties and Properties Held for Sale for further information.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P160_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P160_S2	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P160_S3	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	In August 2013, the Operating Partnership's operating agreement was amended to, among other things, effect a four -for-one split of the outstanding partnership units After the effect of the split, each Class A common limited partnership unit held by Non-Company LPs may be exchanged for one common share of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P161_S1	Prior to the split, each unit held by the Non-Company LPs was exchangeable for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P161_S2	All references to the number of units outstanding and per unit amounts reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	Reclassifications - We have revised the previously reported amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows to reclassify approximately $2.1 million related to tax increment financing for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the caption "additions to rental property" from the caption "proceeds from tax increment financing" to conform to the presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	We have concluded the previously reported financial statements were not materially misstated as a result of this revision.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	In September 2011, we purchased substantially all of the economic interests in The Outlets at Hershey, a 248,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	A portion of the cash consideration paid to the buyer included a $6.2 million loan, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, collateralized by their remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	In October 2014, the loan was canceled in exchange for this remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	In August 2013, Deer Park completed a refinancing of its existing debt and then immediately restructured the ownership whereby we acquired an additional ownership interest in the property from one of the partners which gave us a controlling interest.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P164_S1	With the acquisition of this additional interest, we have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date, and remeasured our previously held interest that was accounted for as an equity method investment.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	Prior to the acquisition, Deer Park successfully negotiated new financing of the debt obligations for the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans totaling approximately $238.5 million , with a $150.0 million mortgage loan.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	The new five year mortgage loan bears interest at a 150 basis point spread over LIBOR.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S2	The previous mortgage and mezzanine loans were in default, and as part of the refinancing, all default interest associated with the loans was waived.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S3	Utilizing funding from our existing unsecured lines of credit, we loaned approximately $89.5 million at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and due on August 30, 2020 to the Deer Park joint venture representing the remaining amount necessary to repay the previous mortgage and mezzanine loans.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S4	As a result of the refinancing, Deer Park recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $13.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P165_S5	Our share of this gain along with our share of the income from the settlement of a lawsuit by Deer Park with a third party totaled approximately $7.8 million , which has been included in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	Subsequent to the debt extinguishment, we acquired an additional one-third interest in the Deer Park property from one of the owners, bringing our total ownership to a two-thirds interest, for total consideration of approximately $27.9 million , including $13.9 million in cash and 450,576 in Class A common limited partnership units of Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, which are exchangeable for an equivalent number of the Company's common shares.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P166_S1	This transaction was accounted for as a business combination resulting in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed being recorded at fair value as a result of the step acquisition.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P166_S2	Prior to the acquisition, the joint venture was considered a variable interest entity and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting since we did not have the ability to direct the significant activities that affect the economic performance of the venture as a one-third owner.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P166_S3	Upon acquiring an additional one-third interest, we determined, based on the acquisition agreement and other transaction documents which amended our rights with respect to the property and our obligations with respect to the additional one-third interest, that we control the property assets and direct the property s significant activities and therefore, consolidate the property s assets and liabilities.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	The following table illustrates the fair value of the total consideration transferred and the amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	The aggregate purchase price of the property was allocated as follows:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P169_S1	We incurred approximately $1.0 million in third-party acquisition costs which were expensed as incurred.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P169_S2	As a part of the acquisition accounting, we recorded a gain of $26.0 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in Deer Park.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	Following the acquisition, we and the noncontrolling interest restructured certain aspects of our ownership of the property, whereby we receive substantially all of the economics generated by the property and would have substantial control over the property's financial activities.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S1	We and the noncontrolling interest entered into a triple net lease agreement with a different wholly-owned subsidiary of ours which operates the property as lessee.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S2	Under the new structure, we will serve as property manager and control the management, leasing, marketing and other operations of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S3	We and the noncontrolling interest will receive, in proportion to our respective ownership interests, fixed annual lease payments of approximately $2.5 million , plus an amount necessary to pay the interest expense on debt related to the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S4	In addition, we and the noncontrolling interest have entered into an agreement whereby they may require us to acquire their ownership interest in the property on the second anniversary of the acquisition date for a price of $28.4 million , and we have the option to acquire their ownership interest on the fourth anniversary of the acquisition date at the same price.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S5	On September 30, 2015, the noncontrolling interest in our Deer Park outlet center, exercised its right to require us to acquire its ownership interest.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S6	The transaction closed on January 5, 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P170_S7	The obligation to acquire its interest is recorded as a deferred financing obligation in the other liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	The results of operations from the property are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the acquisition date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	The aggregate revenues and net loss from the property from the acquisition date through December 31, 2013, were $11.1 million and $3.5 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	The following unaudited condensed pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented as if the acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2012, the beginning of the previous reporting period (in thousands, except per share data):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	Supplemental pro forma earnings for 2013 were adjusted to exclude $1.0 million of third-party acquisition costs incurred in 2013 and $26.0 million of nonrecurring gain related to the fair value adjustment.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	The following table sets forth the properties sold for the years ended 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The rental properties did not meet the criteria set forth in the newly-adopted guidance for reporting discontinued operations (See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), thus their results of operations have remained in continuing operations.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	During 2015, we sold our Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch and Barstow outlet centers for a gain of $106.7 million , in aggregate, and we received a combined net proceeds of $149.1 million of which $121.3 million is recorded in restricted cash as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The restricted cash represents the cash proceeds from property sales that are being held by a qualified intermediary in anticipation of such amounts subsequently being invested in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a private buyer to acquire our outlet center in Lincoln City, Oregon along with an option agreement to purchase an additional four properties, which have been classified as rental property held for sale as of December 31, 2014 on the consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P178_S1	Subsequently, the buyer purchased the Lincoln City outlet center in December 2014 for a gain of $7.5 million , but during 2015 chose not to exercise the option to purchase the additional four properties.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P178_S2	In July 2015, we concluded that the sale of these four additional outlet centers was no longer probable, reclassified the assets from held for sale to held and used, and recorded an adjustment of approximately $1.6 million representing the depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the properties been continuously classified as held and used.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The carrying values of the assets classified as rental property held for sale at December 31, 2014 totaled $46.0 million and were comprised of the following (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	In May 2015, we opened an approximately 312,000 square foot outlet center at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $1.0 million and our equity contributions totaled approximately $58.8 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S3	Contributions we make in excess of $40.0 million earn a preferred rate of return of 15% from the date of contribution.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S4	In addition, each partner earns a rate of return of 10% on their initial capital contributions from the date of contribution.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S5	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our partner.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S6	Accordingly, we expect our current economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 67% .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P180_S8	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	In July 2015, we opened an approximately 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P181_S1	The outlet center is located 11 miles south of downtown Grand Rapids at the southwest quadrant of US-131 and 84th Street in Byron Township, Michigan, with visibility from both roads.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	In November 2015, we opened an approximately 320,000 square foot outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	In January 2015, we purchased land for approximately $14.8 million and commenced construction on the development of Tanger Outlets Southaven, which is located less than five miles south of Memphis, Tennessee.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P183_S1	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P183_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , our partner s equity contributions totaled approximately $461,000 and our equity contributions totaled approximately $26.5 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P183_S3	From the date our equity contributions are made, we earn a preferred rate of return of 10% for senior contributions and 14% for junior contributions.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P183_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , the balance of our senior contributions was $17.7 million and our junior contributions was $8.3 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	Under the terms of the joint venture's operating agreement, upon liquidation, we would receive all of our unreturned contributions and all unpaid returns earned on those contributions prior to any distributions being made to our partner.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P184_S1	Accordingly, we expect our current economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage of 50% .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P184_S2	As of December 31, 2015, based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P184_S3	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from asset sales .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	In November 2015, we purchased land for approximately $9.9 million and commenced construction on the development of a wholly owned outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P185_S1	The outlet center is expected to be approximately 352,000 square feet and to open by Holiday 2016.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 aggregated $201.1 million and $208.0 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P186_S1	We have evaluated the accounting treatment for each of the joint ventures and have concluded based on the current facts and circumstances that the equity method of accounting should be used to account for the individual joint ventures.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P186_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we were members of the following unconsolidated real estate joint ventures:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	(1) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than indicated in the Tanger Ownership column, which states our legal interest in this venture.

1004036_16_ITEM15_P240_S2	We fully amortized the remaining balance during 2014 in connection with the early redemption of the associated 10 year senior, unsecured notes in December 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	Fair value guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P241_S1	These tiers are defined as follows:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	The following table sets forth our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	Fair value as of December 31, 2015:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P244_S0	Fair value as of December 31, 2014:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P245_S0	The estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	With the exception of the unsecured term loan and unsecured lines of credit, that have variable rates and considered at market value, fair values of the senior notes and mortgage loans are determined using discounted cash flow analysis with an interest rate or credit spread similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	Because the Company's senior unsecured notes are publicly traded with limited trading volume, these instruments are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P247_S1	In contrast, mortgage loans are classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P248_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P250_S0	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one common share of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P251_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 25,663 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership were exchanged for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P252_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, Non-Company LPs exchanged a total of 66,606 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, Non-Company LPs exchanged a total of 67,428 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	In August 2013, the Operating Partnership's operating agreement was amended to, among other things, effect a four -for-one split of the outstanding partnership units.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P254_S1	After the effect of the split, each Class A common limited partnership unit held by Non-Company LPs may be exchanged for one common share of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P254_S2	Prior to the split, each unit held by the Non-Company LPs was exchangeable for four common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P254_S3	All references to the number of units outstanding and per unit amounts reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P255_S0	All units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership have equal rights with respect to earnings, dividends and net assets.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P255_S1	When the Company issues common shares upon the exercise of options, the issuance of restricted share awards or the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding Class B common limited partnership unit to Tanger LP trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P256_S0	Also, in August 2013 as disclosed in Note 3, the Operating Partnership issued 450,576 Class A common limited partnership units as partial consideration for the acquisition of an additional one-third interest in Deer Park.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P257_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in outstanding partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :
1004036_16_ITEM15_P258_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Non-Company LPs as discussed in Note 2.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P258_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P259_S0	In 2015 and 2014, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership were made as a result of the changes in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon the exercise of options and grants of share-based compensation awards, and additional units received upon the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership into an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P259_S1	As discussed in Note 12, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Non-Company LPs exchanged 25,663 and 66,606 Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership, respectively for an equal number of common shares of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P260_S0	The changes in the Company's ownership interests in the subsidiaries impacted consolidated equity during the periods shown as follows (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P261_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P262_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P262_S1	Notional units granted in 2010 were converted into 933,769 restricted common shares in January 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P262_S2	The restricted common shares vested on December 31, 2014 and were considered participating securities through the vesting date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P263_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes options to purchase common shares when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P263_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 227,400 options and 259,000 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P263_S2	There were no options excluded from the computation for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P264_S0	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P265_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P265_S1	The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P265_S2	Unvested restricted common shares that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P266_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per unit for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per unit amounts).
1004036_16_ITEM15_P266_S1	Note that all per unit amounts reflect a four -for-one split of the Operating Partnership's units in August 2013:
1004036_16_ITEM15_P267_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P267_S1	Notional units granted in 2010 were converted into 933,769 restricted common units in January 2014.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P267_S2	The restricted common units vested on December 31, 2014 and were considered participating securities through the vesting date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P268_S0	The computation of diluted earnings per unit excludes options to purchase common units when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of the common units for the period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P269_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P269_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 227,400 options and 259,000 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P269_S2	There were no options excluded from the computation for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P270_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P270_S1	The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P270_S2	Unvested restricted common units that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P271_S0	When a common share is issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P271_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P272_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P273_S0	We may issue up to 15.4 million common shares under the Plan.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P273_S1	Through December 31, 2015 , we had granted 7,560,260 options, net of options forfeited; 4,898,708 restricted common share awards, net of restricted common shares forfeited or withheld for employees' tax obligations; and notional units which may result in the issuance of a maximum of 636,300 common shares.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P273_S2	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 2,304,732 common shares.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P274_S0	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors).
1004036_16_ITEM15_P275_S0	We recorded share based compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, as follows (in thousands):
1004036_16_ITEM15_P276_S0	Share-based compensation expense capitalized as a part of rental property and deferred lease costs during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $837,000 , $709,000 and $367,000 , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P277_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , there was $28.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested common equity-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P277_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P278_S0	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company granted 357,844 , 373,960 and 349,373 restricted common shares, respectively, to the independent directors and the senior executive officers.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P278_S1	The independent directors' restricted common shares vest ratably over a three year period and the senior executive officers' restricted common shares vest ratably over a five year period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P278_S2	For the restricted shares issued to our chief executive officer during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the restricted share agreement requires him to hold the shares for a minimum of three years following each applicable vesting date thereof.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P278_S3	Compensation expense related to the amortization of the deferred compensation is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the restricted shares.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P278_S4	For all of the restricted common share awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P279_S0	The following table summarizes information related to unvested restricted common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015 :
1004036_16_ITEM15_P280_S0	The total value of restricted common shares vested during the years ended 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $13.1 million , $46.6 million and $10.9 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P280_S1	During 2015 and 2014, we withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P280_S2	The total number of shares withheld were 31,863 an d 412,239 for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were based on the value of the restricted common shares on the vesting date as determined by our closing share price on the day prior to the vesting date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P280_S3	No shares were withheld during 2013.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P280_S4	Total amounts paid for the employees' tax obligation to taxing authorities were $1.1 million and $15.5 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, which is reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P281_S0	In February 2015 the Compensation Committee of the Company approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2015 Outperformance Plan (the 2015 OPP").
1004036_16_ITEM15_P281_S1	The 2015 OPP is a long-term performance based incentive compensation plan pursuant to which award recipients may earn up to an aggregate of 306,600 restricted common shares of the Company based on the Company s absolute share price appreciation (or total shareholder return) and its share price appreciation relative to its peer group over a three year measurement period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P281_S2	The measurement period for the 2015 OPP is January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P282_S0	Any shares earned at the end of the three year measurement period are subject to a time based vesting schedule, with 50% of the shares vesting in the January immediately following the measurement period, and the remaining 50% vesting in January one year thereafter, contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the vesting dates (unless terminated prior thereto (a) by the Company without cause, (b) by participant for good reason or (c) due to death or disability.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P283_S0	The maximum number of shares will be earned under this plan if the Company both (a) achieves 35% or higher share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid, over the respective three -year measurement periods and (b) is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the respective three -year measurement period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P283_S1	The maximum value of the awards that could be earned on December 31, 2017, if the Company achieves or exceeds the 35% share price appreciation and is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the applicable three -year measurement period, will equal approximately $14.5 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P284_S0	With respect to 60% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 25% over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 30% , and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 35% or higher.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P285_S0	With respect to 40% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 50th percentile of its peer group over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 60th percentile of its peer group during this period, and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 70th percentile of its peer group or greater during this period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P286_S0	The peer group is based on companies included in the SNL Equity REIT index.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P287_S0	The performance shares for the 2015 OPP will convert on a pro-rata basis by linear interpolation between share price appreciation thresholds, both for absolute share price appreciation and for relative share price appreciation amongst the Company's peer group.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P287_S1	The share price targets will be reduced on a penny-for-penny basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P287_S2	The compensation expense is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P287_S3	The fair value of the awards are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P288_S0	In February 2014 and 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2014 Outperformance Plan (the 2014 OPP") and the 2013 Outperformance Plan (the 2013 OPP").
1004036_16_ITEM15_P288_S1	The 2014 OPP and 2013 OPP are long-term performance based incentive compensation plans pursuant to which award recipients may earn up to an aggregate of 329,700 and 315,150 restricted common shares, respectively, of the Company based on the Company s absolute share price appreciation (or total shareholder return) and its share price appreciation relative to its peer group over a three year measurement period.

1004036_16_ITEM15_P289_S0	Any shares earned at the end of the three year measurement period are subject to a time based vesting schedule, with 50% of the shares vesting in the January immediately following the measurement period, and the remaining 50% vesting in January one year thereafter, contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the vesting dates (unless terminated prior thereto (a) by the Company without cause, (b) by participant for good reason or (c) due to death or disability.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P290_S0	The maximum number of shares will be earned under these plans if the Company both (a) achieves 35% or higher share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid, over the respective three -year measurement periods and (b) is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the respective three -year measurement periods.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P290_S1	The maximum value of the awards that could be earned on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, if the Company achieves or exceeds the 35% share price appreciation and is in the 70th or greater percentile of its peer group for total shareholder return over the applicable three -year measurement period, will equal approximately $13.3 million and $14.3 million , respectively.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P291_S0	With respect to 70% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 25% over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 30% , and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company s aggregate share price appreciation, inclusive of all dividends paid during this period, equals 35% or higher.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P292_S0	With respect to 30% of the performance shares, 33.33% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 50th percentile of its peer group over the three -year measurement period, 66.67% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 60th percentile of its peer group during this period, and 100% of this portion of the award will be earned if the Company's share price appreciation inclusive of all dividends paid is in the 70th percentile of its peer group or greater during this period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P293_S0	The peer group is based on companies included in the SNL Equity REIT index.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P294_S0	The performance shares for the 2014 OPP and 2013 OPP will convert on a pro-rata basis by linear interpolation between share price appreciation thresholds, both for absolute share price appreciation and for relative share price appreciation amongst the Company's peer group.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P294_S1	The share price targets will be reduced on a penny-for-penny basis with respect to any dividend payments made during the measurement period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P294_S2	The compensation expense is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P294_S3	The fair value of the awards are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P295_S0	On December 31, 2015, the measurement period for the 2013 OPP expired and neither of the Company s absolute nor relative total shareholder returns were sufficient for employees to earn, and therefore become eligible to vest in, any restricted shares under the plan.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P295_S1	Accordingly, all 2013 OPP performance awards were automatically forfeited.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P296_S0	During the first quarter of 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee approved the general terms of the Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, (the "2010 Multi Year Performance Plan").
1004036_16_ITEM15_P296_S1	Under the 2010 Multi-Year Performance Plan, we granted 392,000 notional units, net of notional units forfeited, to award recipients as a group, which would convert into restricted common shares on a one-for one basis, one-for two basis, or one-for- three basis depending upon the amount by which the Company's common shares appreciated above a minimum level over a four year performance period ending December 31, 2013, not to exceed a total value of approximately $32.2 million .
1004036_16_ITEM15_P296_S2	Based on the Company's performance over the four year measurement period, we issued 933,769 restricted common shares in January 2014 which vested on December 31, 2014 contingent on continued employment through the vesting date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P297_S0	In February 2014, the Company granted 282,500 options to non-executive employees of the Company.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P297_S1	The exercise price of the options granted during the first quarter of 2014 was $32.02 which equaled the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P297_S2	The options expire 10 years from the date of grant and 20% of the options become exercisable in each of the first five years commencing one year from the date of grant.
1004036_16_ITEM15_P297_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield 2.8% ; expected life of 7 years; expected volatility of 32% ; a risk-free rate of 2.46% ; and forfeiture rates of 3.0% to 13.5% dependent upon the employee's position within the Company.

1004036_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of our common shares.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	We also operate in a manner intended to enable us to preserve our status as a REIT, including, among other things, making distributions with respect to our then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of our taxable income each year.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company is a North Carolina corporation that was incorporated in March 1993 and the Operating Partnership is a North Carolina partnership that was formed in May 1993.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our executive offices are currently located at 3200 Northline Avenue, Suite 360, Greensboro, North Carolina, 27408 and our telephone number is (336) 292-3010.

1004036_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	In June 2016, we completed the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Glendale, Arizona, for a total cash price of approximately $40.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of June 30, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	The total cash price included $39.0 million to acquire the 40% ownership interest held by the equity partner in the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	We also purchased the remaining 2% noncontrolling ownership interests in the Westgate outlet center held in a consolidated partnership for a purchase price of $1.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	The acquisition of the noncontrolling ownership interest was recorded as an equity transaction and, as a result, the carrying balances of the noncontrolling interest were eliminated and the remaining difference between the purchase price and carrying balance was recorded as a reduction in additional-paid-in-capital.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We funded the total purchase price with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	At the time of the acquisition, the property was subject to a $62.0 million mortgage loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75% and a maturity in June 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	In August 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan in full with proceeds from the public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2026.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to the other partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	At the time of acquisition, the property was subject to a $96.9 million construction loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% , that would have matured in May 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	In September 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of the acquisition date.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Prior to this transaction, we owned a 50% legal interest in the joint venture since its formation and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	However, due to preferred equity contributions we made to the joint venture, and the returns earned on those contributions, our estimated economic interest in the book value of the assets was approximately 98% .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	Therefore, substantially all of the earnings of the joint venture were previously recognized by us as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In November 2016, we opened an approximately 349,000 square foot, wholly-owned, outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	This outlet center features over 80 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	In July 2016, we commenced construction on a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The expansion is expected to be open by the third quarter of 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	In September 2016, we purchased land in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area for approximately $11.2 million and began construction immediately on the development of a wholly-owned outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The outlet center will be located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	The outlet center is expected to be open by Holiday 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	In June 2016, we opened an approximately 355,000 square foot outlet center in Columbus, Ohio.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we and our partner had each contributed $47.5 million to fund development activities.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	In November 2016, the joint venture closed on an interest-only mortgage loan of $85.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	The loan initially matures in November 2019, with two one -year extension options.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	The joint venture received net loan proceeds of $84.2 million and distributed them equally to the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are providing property management, marketing and leasing services to the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	During construction, our partner provided development services to the joint venture and we, along with our partner, provided joint leasing services.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	In January 2016, we sold our outlet center in Fort Myers, Florida for net proceeds of approximately $25.8 million for a gain of $4.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The proceeds from the sale of this unencumbered asset were used to pay down balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	In January 2016, we repaid our $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, which had an original maturity date in August 2018 and was related to our 749,000 square foot Deer Park outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	In April 2016, we amended our unsecured term loan to increase the size of the loan from $250.0 million to $325.0 million , extend the maturity date from February 23, 2019 to April 13, 2021, reduce the interest rate spread over LIBOR from 1.05% to 0.95% , and increase the incremental loan availability through an accordion feature from $150.0 million to $175.0 million .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	In April 2016, we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements, effective April 13, 2016 that fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.03% on notional amounts totaling $175.0 million through January 1, 2021.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	In August 2016, we completed a public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2026 in an underwritten public offering.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	The notes were priced at 99.605% of the principal amount to yield 3.171% to maturity.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	In October 2016, we sold an additional $100.0 million of our senior notes due 2026.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	The notes priced at 98.962% of the principal amount to yield 3.248% to maturity.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	The notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.125% per annum and mature on September 1, 2026.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	The aggregate net proceeds from the offerings, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $344.5 million .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay a $62.0 million floating rate mortgage loan related to the outlet center in Glendale (Westgate), Arizona, repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit, and for general corporate purposes.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products, some of which are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Outlet centers enable retailers to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Outlet centers also enable manufacturers and brand name retailers to establish a direct relationship with their customers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that outlet centers present an attractive opportunity for capital investment as many retailers view the outlet concept as a profitable distribution channel.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	However, due to present economic conditions, the availability of multiple retail channels, and the potential for increased competition from other outlet center developers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Each of our outlet centers, except one joint venture property, carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have established long-standing relationships with many of our tenants that we believe is critical in developing and operating successful outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 749,074 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Ann Taylor, American Eagle Outfitters, Banana Republic Factory Store, Barneys New York, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach, Gap Outlet, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss Factory Store, J. Crew, Kate Spade New York, Lululemon Athletica, Michael Kors, Nike Factory Store, North Face, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour, Victoria s Secret, Vineyard Vines and others.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , no single tenant accounted for more than 7.6% of our leasable square feet or 6.2% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	Because many of our tenants are large, multinational manufacturers or retailers, we have not experienced material losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 91% of our total revenues in 2016 .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues in 2016 .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 36 years.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , our consolidated outlet centers were 98% occupied with average tenant sales of $394 per square foot.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development, leasing and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing outlet centers, renovating and expanding selected outlet centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	Future outlet centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Due to the overall high performance of our outlet shopping centers, we have historically been able to renew leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract stronger, more popular brands to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	We believe our 36 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support outlet centers with approximately 80 to 90 stores totaling at least 325,000 to 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 60% of the space in each outlet center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 60% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Keeping our outlet shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a re-merchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P43_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our long-standing retailer relationships and our focus on identifying emerging retailers allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and home goods.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	In order for our outlet centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our outlet centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, our consumer website, Internet advertising, social networks, mobile applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or issue equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2017 .
1004036_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and when our next significant debt maturity, our unsecured line of credit facilities, occurs in 2019.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our outlet centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls, full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Traditional full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of and depth of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Tenants of outlet centers typically avoid direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores, and, therefore, generally insist that the outlet centers not be within a close proximity of major department stores or the tenants' own specialty stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	For this reason, our outlet centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, individual owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive marketing programs to drive traffic to the centers and relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to limit the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have one reportable operating segment.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	For financial information regarding our segment, see our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina where our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	As of February 1, 2017 , we maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 38 consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	As of February 1, 2017 , we had 297 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 40 business offices.
1004036_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	At that date, we also employed 362 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, changes in government policies and regulations, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Dispositions may not achieve anticipated results.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we may strategically dispose of assets with the goal of improving the overall performance of our core portfolio.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	However, we may not achieve the results we originally anticipated at the time of disposition.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we are not successful at achieving the anticipated results, there is a potential for a significant adverse impact on our returns and our overall profitability.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks, whether in the United States, Canada or elsewhere, or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending, and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties, impair the ability of tenants to meet their obligations under their existing leases, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if rental rates at our centers decrease, if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our outlet centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If the sales or profitability of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, whether due to a change in consumer preferences, legislative changes that increase the cost of their operations or otherwise, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Such bankruptcy, or the voluntary closings of a significant amount of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders' interests.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We own partial interests in outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of terrorist attacks, war, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Shoppers may choose to spend a greater percentage of their disposable income to purchase goods through e-commerce or other retail channels, which could reduce the number of trips to our outlet centers and the average amount spent per visit.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Such a change in consumer spending habits could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our Canadian investments may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , through a co-ownership arrangement with a Canadian REIT, we have an ownership interest in four properties in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our operating results and the value of our Canadian operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the Canadian dollar.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Canadian ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success significantly depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Although we believe we have a strong management team with relevant industry expertise, the extended loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the securities markets' view of our prospects and materially harm our business.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, our continued success and the achievement of our expansion goals are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees as we expand.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	A recent IRS revenue procedure allows the Company to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 90% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In the event that the Company pays a portion of a dividend in shares, certain U.S. shareholders would be required to pay income tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares, in which case such shareholders might have to pay the income tax using cash from other sources.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If a U.S. shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay this income tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our shares at the time of the sale.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Future changes to tax laws may adversely affect the taxation of the REIT, its subsidiaries or its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	These potential changes could generally result in REIT s having fewer tax advantages, and may lead REIT s to determine that it would be more advantageous to elect to be taxed, for federal income tax purposes, as a corporation.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Not all states automatically conform to changes in the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Some states use the legislative process to decide whether it is in their best interests to conform or not to various provisions of the Code.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	This could increase the complexity of our compliance efforts, increase compliance costs, and may subject us to additional taxes and audit risk.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be attacked by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We use information technology systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business to provide timely service to our customers and maintain our relationships with our tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release or loss of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.

1004036_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 749,074 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	The outlet centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the outlet centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	The outlet center in Deer Park, New York is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2016 .
1004036_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 .

1004036_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring outlet centers, developing new outlet centers and expanding existing outlet centers.

1004036_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the outlet centers are borne by the tenants.

1004036_17_ITEM2_P8_S1	(2) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage.

1004036_17_ITEM2_P12_S0	Based on current market base rental rates, we believe we will achieve overall positive increases in our average base rental income for leases expiring in 2017 .
1004036_17_ITEM2_P12_S1	However, changes in base rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the base rents on new leases will continue to increase from current levels, if at all.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had 36 consolidated outlet centers in 22 states totaling 12.7 million square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We also had 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling 2.3 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	The table below details our acquisitions, new developments, expansions and dispositions of consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers that significantly impacted our results of operations and liquidity from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 :
1004036_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following table provides information for our consolidated outlet centers regarding space re-leased or renewed during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	(1) Excludes Fort Myers outlet center, which was sold in January 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	(2) Excludes Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch and Barstow outlet centers which were sold in 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	(3) Net average straight-line base rent is calculated by dividing the average tenant allowance costs per square foot by the average initial term and subtracting this calculated number from the average straight-line base rent per year amount.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	The average annual straight-line base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net Income Net income decreased $17.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	In 2016, we recorded a $95.5 million gain on the acquisitions of our venture partners' equity interests in the Westgate and Savannah joint ventures, a $4.9 million gain on the sale of our outlet center in Fort Myers, Florida and $1.4 million gain on the sale of an outparcel at our Hwy 501 outlet center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	In 2015, we recorded gains totaling $120.4 million related to the sale of our equity interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, and the sales of our Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch and Barstow outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	In addition, net income in 2016 was impacted by:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	an increase in interest expense due to higher average borrowing levels and an increase in interest rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In the tables below, information set forth for new developments includes our Foxwoods, Grand Rapids, Southaven and Daytona Beach outlet centers, which opened in May 2015, July 2015, November 2015 and November 2016, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Acquisitions include our Westgate and Savannah centers, which were previously held in unconsolidated joint ventures prior to our acquisitions of our venture partners' interest in each venture in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Properties disposed includes the Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch outlet centers sold in September 2015, the Barstow outlet center sold in October 2015 and the Fort Myers outlet center sold in January 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Base Rentals Base rentals increased $18.7 million , or 6% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals, incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces and multiple tenant rental step-ups.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Fees received from the early termination of leases, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, decreased as a result of fewer store closures throughout the portfolio in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the combined net value representing the amount of unamortized above market lease assets and below market lease liability values, recorded as a part of the purchase price of acquired properties, was a net below market liability which totaled approximately $403,000 .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value would be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals increased $1.1 million , or 10% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above their contractual break points.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in percentage rentals from existing properties is due to higher sales volume for certain existing tenants and also due to certain new tenants added to the existing properties whose sales exceeded their contractual break point.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $7.4 million , or 6% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Expense reimbursements represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	For certain tenants, we receive a fixed payment for common area maintenance ("CAM") with annual escalations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	While certain expense reimbursements generally fluctuate consistently with the related expenses, our expense recoveries for CAM as a percentage of expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to leases with fixed-CAM escalations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses for the property.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	See "Property Operating Expenses" below for a discussion of the increase in operating expenses from our existing properties.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Most, but not all, leases contain provisions requiring tenants to reimburse a share of our operating expenses as additional rent.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, substantially all of the leases for our new Foxwoods outlet center, which opened in May 2015, require tenants to pay a single minimum contractual gross rent and, in certain cases, percentage rent; thus, all minimum rents received for the Foxwoods outlet center are recorded as base rent and none are recorded to expense reimbursements.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services decreased $1.6 million , or 29% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	The decrease in management, leasing and other services is primarily due to the 2016 consolidation of both our Westgate and Savannah outlet centers due to the acquisitions of our venture partners' equity interests.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	This decrease was partially offset by development and leasing fees earned in 2016 from services provided to the Columbus joint venture which opened in June 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Other Income Other income increased $965,000 , or 13% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization recorded as a result of a change in the estimated useful life of assets at various centers where demolition of existing buildings occurred in conjunction with renovations and expansions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $6.5 million , or 12% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, due to (1) the conversion of $525.0 million of debt with floating interest rates to higher fixed interest rates, (2) the 30-day LIBOR, which impacts the interest rate we pay on our remaining floating rate debt, increasing relative to its level in the 2015 period, and (3) the additional debt incurred related to the Westgate and Savannah acquisitions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Gain on Sale of Assets and Interests in Unconsolidated Entities The gain on sale of assets and interest in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $114.1 million , or 95% , in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In September 2016, we sold an outparcel at our outlet center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina located on Highway 501 for net proceeds of approximately $2.9 million and recognized a gain of approximately $1.4 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Also, in the first quarter of 2016, we sold our Fort Myers outlet center for approximately $25.8 million , which resulted in a gain of $4.9 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	In February 2015, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million from the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	In September 2015, we sold our Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch outlet centers for approximately $43.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $20.2 million and in October 2015, we sold our Barstow outlet center for approximately $105.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $86.5 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gain on Previously Held Interest in Acquired Joint Venture In June 2016, we completed the purchase of our venture partner's interest in the Westgate joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Glendale, Arizona, for a total cash price of approximately $40.9 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The purchase was funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Westgate joint venture, we recorded a gain of $49.3 million , which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia, distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to the other partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Savannah joint venture, we recorded a gain of $46.3 million , which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the Savannah joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening in April 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $612,000 or 5% in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures from new developments is due to the incremental earnings from the Columbus outlet center, which opened in June 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The equity in earnings from properties acquired or disposed includes our Westgate and Savannah joint ventures due to the acquisition of the venture partners' interest in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Equity in earnings from properties acquired or disposed in the 2015 period includes the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, which we sold in February 2015.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The majority of this increase was due to gains from the sale of our equity interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, and the sales of our Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch and Barstow outlet centers, which resulted in gains totaling approximately $120.4 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, net income increased in the 2015 period primarily due to:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Offsetting some of the increases to net income include:

1004036_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Termination fees, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, increased in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period as a result of certain brand-wide store closures throughout our portfolio.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses, generally fluctuate consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Most, but not all, leases contain provisions requiring tenants to reimburse a share of our operating expenses as additional rent.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, substantially all of the leases for our new Foxwoods outlet center, which opened in May 2015, require tenants to pay a single minimum contractual gross rent and, in certain cases, percentage rent.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Thus, all minimum rents received for the Foxwoods outlet center are recorded as base rent and none are recorded to expense reimbursements.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The increase in fees recognized was due to the increase in the number of unconsolidated joint ventures for which we provide services in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The majority of the increases was due to fees from the Savannah outlet center which opened in April 2015.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $3.7 million, or 6%, in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period, due to the issuance of $250 million senior notes in November 2014 which bear an interest rate of 3.75%.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The net proceeds were used in December 2014 to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes which had an original maturity of November 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt In November 2014, we completed a $250 million, 3.75% senior notes offering.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The net proceeds were used to redeem our $250 million, 6.15% senior notes originally due November 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	We recorded a charge of approximately $13.1 million for the make-whole premium related to the early redemption, which was completed in December 2014.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Gain on Sale of Assets and Interests in Unconsolidated Entities In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	In September 2015, we sold our Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch outlet centers for approximately $43.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $20.2 million and in October 2015, we sold our Barstow outlet center for approximately $105.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $86.5 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately $2.4 million, or 27%, in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures from new developments is due to the incremental earnings from the Charlotte outlet center, which opened during the third quarter of 2014; the Ottawa outlet center, which opened during the fourth quarter of 2014; and the Savannah outlet center, which opened in April 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The equity in earnings from properties disposed are related to our equity interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture, which we sold in February 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2018 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties and invest in existing or newly created joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P67_S4	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Based on our 2016 estimated taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $98.4 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	We distributed approximately $120.0 million during 2016, which excludes a special dividend paid in January 2016 related to the 2015 tax year, to shareholders, which exceeded our required distributions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	In 2016, our cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in operating income as a result of the net growth in leasable square feet in our portfolio of outlet centers and an increase in distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities from 2015 to 2016 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	We used restricted cash of $121.3 million in 2016, which was received in 2015, to repay a portion of our $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, which had an original maturity date in August 2018, and our $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which related to the Deer Park outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Cash used for additions to rental property decreased in 2016 due to less new outlet center construction activity in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The 2015 period included additions for our Foxwoods, Grand Rapids, and Southaven outlet centers, all of which opened during 2015, while the 2016 period primarily included construction at our Daytona Beach outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Distributions in excess of earnings increased in the 2016 period due the Columbus joint venture closing on an interest-only mortgage loan of $85.0 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The joint venture received net loan proceeds of $84.2 million and distributed them equally to the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our share of the distribution was $42.1 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Partially offsetting the above items were the acquisitions of our venture partners' interest in our Westgate joint venture and Savannah joint venture and fewer contributions in the 2016 period to our unconsolidated joint ventures as a result of less development activity in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities from 2015 to 2016 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Increase in cash distributions paid due to a special dividend that was paid in January 2016 and an increase in quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders in 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Increase in cash used for debt repayments, which included the repayments of the Deer Park $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, the $10.0 million unsecured note payable, the $7.5 million unsecured term note, the Westgate $62.0 million floating rate mortgage and our Savannah $98.0 million floating rate mortgage.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Cash used for the payment of a deferred financing obligation to a former partner at Deer Park, which increased our legal ownership to 100%.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Partially offsetting the above items was an increase in borrowings including the public offering of an aggregate $350 million of 3.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2026, netting proceeds of approximately $344.5 million and an additional $75.0 million in proceeds received from an amendment to our unsecured term loan to increase the size of the loan from $250.0 million to $325.0 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	In 2015, new borrowings for notes, mortgages, loans totaled $90.8 million and was primarily related to construction draws related to the Southaven and Foxwoods mortgages.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	In 2015, we also repaid the mortgages at our Hershey and Ocean City outlet centers, which totaled $46.6 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Memphis outlet centers which opened in May 2015, July 2015, and November 2015, respectively, four small expansions of our consolidated properties completed during 2014, and an increase in distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures from the new centers and expansions completed in 2014.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Memphis outlet centers which opened during 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Less cash was received in 2015 compared to 2014 from unconsolidated joint ventures that represented a return of investment as the 2014 period included the distribution of $89.4 million in net loan proceeds related the Charlotte joint venture that was distributed equally to the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Cash provided from assets sales increased year over year as in 2015 we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center and five other properties compared to a sale of one property in 2014.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	Of the $164.6 million in proceeds received from the 2015 asset sales, approximately $121.3 million was held as restricted cash as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Contributions to our unconsolidated joint ventures for the property development activities was much less in 2015 compared to 2014 as one new joint venture project (Savannah) was under construction during the 2015 period compared to the construction of three new properties (Charlotte, Ottawa and Savannah) and two significant expansions (Cookstown and Westgate) in the 2014 period.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in the amounts paid by us on behalf of certain employees related to income taxes from shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	The increase was offset by an increase in the quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S4	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S5	We may also enter into letters of intent for the acquisition or disposition of properties.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P98_S6	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	In June 2016, we completed the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Glendale, Arizona, for a total cash price of approximately $40.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of June 30, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	The total cash price included $39.0 million to acquire the 40% ownership interest held by the equity partner in the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	We also purchased the remaining 2% noncontrolling ownership interests in the Westgate outlet center held in a consolidated partnership for a purchase price of $1.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	The acquisition of the noncontrolling ownership interest was recorded as an equity transaction and, as a result, the carrying balances of the noncontrolling interest were eliminated and the remaining difference between the purchase price and carrying balance was recorded as a reduction in additional-paid-in-capital.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We funded the total purchase price with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	At the time of the acquisition, the property was subject to a $62.0 million mortgage loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75% and a maturity in June 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	In August 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan in full with proceeds from the public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2026.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to the other partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	At the time of acquisition, the property was subject to a $96.9 million construction loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% , that would have matured in May 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P102_S3	In September 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of the acquisition date.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Prior to this transaction, we owned a 50% legal interest in the joint venture since its formation and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	However, due to preferred equity contributions we made to the joint venture, and the returns earned on those contributions, our estimated economic interest in the book value of the assets was approximately 98% .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	Therefore, substantially all of the earnings of the joint venture were previously recognized by us as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	In November 2016, we opened an approximately 349,000 square foot, wholly-owned, outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	This outlet center features over 80 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	The following table summarizes our projects under development as of December 31, 2016 :
1004036_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	In September 2016, we purchased land in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area for approximately $11.2 million and began construction immediately on the development of a wholly-owned outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The outlet center will be located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	In July 2016, we commenced construction on a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	In January 2016, we sold our outlet center in Fort Myers, Florida for net proceeds of approximately $25.8 million for a gain of $4.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	The proceeds from the sale of this unencumbered asset were used to pay down balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	In September 2016, we also sold an outparcel at our outlet center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina located on Highway 501 for net proceeds of approximately $2.9 million for a gain of $1.4 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	From time to time, we form joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flow from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , unsecured borrowings represented 90% of our outstanding debt and 88% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , 11% of our outstanding debt , excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	We maintain unsecured lines of credit that provide for borrowings of up to $520.0 million.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	The unsecured lines of credit include a $20.0 million liquidity line and a $500.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S4	The syndicated line may be increased up to $1.0 billion through an accordion feature in certain circumstances.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S5	The unsecured lines of credit have an expiration date of October 24, 2019 with an option for a one year extension.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S6	The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership's obligations under these lines.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P113_S7	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $453.6 million available under our unsecured lines of credit after considering outstanding letters of credit of $5.4 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	In January 2016, we used restricted cash and unsecured lines of credit to repay our $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, which had an original maturity date in August 2018, and our $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which are related to our 749,000 square foot outlet center in Deer Park, NY.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	These transactions allowed us to unencumber the Deer Park asset while simultaneously deferring a significant portion of the gains related to the assets sold in 2015 for tax purposes.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2016 .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P133_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2016 was used.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have commitments of $77.9 million remaining as of December 31, 2016 related to contracts to complete construction, development activity at outlet centers, and other capital expenditures throughout our consolidated portfolio.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $33.7 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P134_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our debt agreements contain covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P136_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	We believe our most restrictive financial covenants are contained in our senior, unsecured notes.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	A REIT that distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and that meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	Based on our 2016 estimated taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $98.4 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	We distributed approximately $120.0 million , which excludes a special dividend paid in January 2016 related to the 2015 tax year, to shareholders, which exceeded our required distributions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P139_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2016 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	(1) The negative carrying value is due to the distributions of proceeds from mortgage loans and quarterly distributions of excess cash flow exceeding the original contributions from the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our joint ventures are generally subject to buy-sell provisions which are customary for joint venture agreements in the real estate industry.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	Either partner may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up period), which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or additional borrowings to acquire the other party's interest.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P142_S2	Under these provisions, one partner sets a price for the property, then the other partner has the option to either (1) purchase their partner's interest based on that price or (2) sell its interest to the other partner based on that price.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P142_S3	Since the partner other than the partner who triggers the provision has the option to be the buyer or seller, we do not consider this arrangement to be a mandatory redeemable obligation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	We provide guarantees to lenders for our joint ventures which include standard non-recourse carve out indemnifications for losses arising from items such as but not limited to fraud, physical waste, payment of taxes, environmental indemnities, misapplication of insurance proceeds or security deposits and failure to maintain required insurance.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	The principal guarantees include terms for release based upon satisfactory completion of construction and performance targets including occupancy thresholds and minimum debt service coverage tests.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P143_S3	Our joint ventures may contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P148_S2	The loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P148_S3	At the closing of the amendment, the joint venture distributed approximately $19.0 million equally between the partners.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	Under the agreement, any outlet centers developed or acquired will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services for the outlet centers and RioCan has agreed to provide development and property management services.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	In October 2014, the co-owners opened Tanger Outlets Ottawa, the first ground up development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P151_S1	In March 2016, the co-owners opened an approximately 28,000 square foot expansion related to an anchor tenant bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 316,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P151_S2	In 2016, the co-owners commenced construction on a 40,000 square foot expansion, which is expected to open during the second quarter of 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	In November 2014, the co-owners opened an approximately 149,000 square foot expansion to the existing Cookstown Outlet Mall, bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 308,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Other properties owned by the RioCan Canada co-owners include Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur and Bromont Outlet Mall.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P153_S1	Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur is approximately 116,000 square feet and the Bromont Outlet Mall is approximately 161,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Rental property held and used by our joint ventures are reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	In such an event, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	During 2016, the joint venture determined for its Bromont, Quebec outlet center that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of that property did not exceed the property's carrying value based on the reduction in the property's net operating income.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	Therefore, the joint venture recorded a $5.8 million non-cash impairment charge in its statement of operations, which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P155_S2	The fair value was determined using the income approach whereby the joint venture considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P155_S3	Our share of this impairment charge, $2.9 million , was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in our consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	In May 2016, we expanded our outlet center in Savannah by approximately 42,000 square feet, bringing the outlet center's total gross leasable area to approximately 419,000 square feet.

1004036_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	We acquired our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture in June 2016 and have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the outlet center located in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represented the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	The following table details information regarding the outstanding debt of the unconsolidated joint ventures and guarantees of such debt provided by us as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	(2) The joint venture debt amount includes premium recorded upon assumption of the debt during acquisition of approximately $482,000 .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	Fees we received for various services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	We consolidate properties that are wholly owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIE").
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, we consolidate the entity where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S3	Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S4	Our determination of the primary beneficiary considers various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P166_S5	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that we do not control but may exercise significant influence on are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income or loss, cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P169_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P169_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P169_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	We capitalize costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and salaries and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P173_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P173_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P173_S4	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures with qualifying development activities.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized includes amounts paid to third-party brokers and salaries and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P176_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	Fair value is determined using an income approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	We recognized no impairment losses for our consolidated properties during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P177_S2	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, for discussion of the impairment of our unconsolidated joint venture at the Bromont, Quebec outlet center during 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P182_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P182_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P182_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting pronouncements issued.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Funds From Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance for real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P184_S1	We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), of which we are a member.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P184_S2	FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P185_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	In addition, a portion of cash bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO or Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), which is described in the section below.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	We believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate our performance and that of our management.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	In addition, FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	FFO is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P187_S3	NAREIT has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	We present AFFO, as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P191_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	In addition, we believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate management s performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P192_S2	We use AFFO when certain material, unplanned transactions occur as a factor in evaluating management's performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and may use AFFO when determining incentive compensation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	(1) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interests are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P196_S1	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P196_S2	(2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents cash severance and accelerated vesting of restricted shares associated with the departure of an officer in August 2016 and the accelerated vesting of restricted shares due to the death of a director in February 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P196_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the reversal of certain share-based compensation awards previously recognized on awards not expected to vest due to the announcement that the Company s then Chief Financial Officer would retire in May 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	We present portfolio net operating income ("Portfolio NOI") and Same Center NOI as supplemental measures of our operating performance.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P197_S1	Portfolio NOI represents our property level net operating income which is defined as total operating revenues less property operating expenses and excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on the sale of outparcels recognized during the periods presented.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P197_S2	We define Same Center NOI as Portfolio NOI for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired or subject to a material expansion or non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	We believe Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI are non-GAAP metrics used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure the operating performance of our properties because they provide performance measures directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income, FFO or AFFO.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	Because Same Center NOI excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as non-cash adjustments, gains or losses on the sale of outparcels and termination rents; it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P198_S2	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of our financial performance since they do not reflect the entire operations of our portfolio, nor do they reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P199_S1	Because of these limitations, Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be viewed in isolation to or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P199_S2	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI only as supplemental measures.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI for the consolidated portfolio (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales, as applicable.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	(2) Excluded from Same Center NOI:
1004036_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P202_S2	Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S1	During 2016 , approximately 1.4 million square feet, or 12% , of our then owned, consolidated portfolio came up for renewal and 1.6 million square feet, or 13% , of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2017 .
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S2	During 2016 , we renewed 85% of the square feet that came up for renewal with the existing tenants at an 18% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S3	We also re-tenanted 384,000 square feet at a 27% increase in the average base rental rate.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S4	In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar increases in base rental rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P205_S6	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P206_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P206_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States and Canada, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P206_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 7.6% of our square feet or 6.2% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P206_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_17_ITEM7_P206_S4	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 98% and 97%, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Cash flows received from our Canadian joint ventures are either reinvested to fund ongoing Canadian development activity, if applicable, or converted to US dollars and utilized to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P1_S7	We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In April 2016, we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements, effective April 13, 2016 that fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.03% on notional amounts totaling $175.0 million through January 1, 2021.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	In addition, in October 2013, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million to reduce our floating rate debt exposure.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 1.30% and mature in August 2018.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , the fair value of these contracts is an asset of $4.0 million .
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P2_S5	The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates, remaining term to maturity and our credit standing.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , 11% of our outstanding debt, excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $1.9 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt of approximately $69.1 million and $50.3 million , respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our methodology in calculating the estimated fair value of debt.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_17_ITEM9_P0_S0	The information required by this Item 9 was previously reported in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Current Report on Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A amending such Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2015 and March 2, 2016, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer, James F. Williams (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2016 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2016 .

1004036_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P74_S4	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P74_S5	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P75_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") which, through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P100_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we owned and operated 36 consolidated outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 12.7 million square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P100_S3	All references to gross leasable area, square feet, occupancy, stores and store brands contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	These outlet centers were 98% occupied and contained over 2,600 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.3 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P102_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P102_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company, through its ownership of Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 96,095,891 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the "Non-Company LPs") collectively owned 5,027,781 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S4	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P103_S5	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P104_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P104_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	We consolidate properties that are wholly owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P106_S1	Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIE").
1004036_17_ITEM15_P106_S2	For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, we consolidate the entity where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P106_S3	Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P106_S4	Our determination of the primary beneficiary considers various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that we do not control but may exercise significant influence on are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P107_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income or loss, cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	For certain of these investments, we record our equity in the venture's net income or loss under the hypothetical liquidation at book value ( HLBV ) method of accounting due to the structures and the preferences we receive on the distributions from our joint ventures pursuant to the respective joint venture agreements for those joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	Under this method, we recognize income and loss in each period based on the change in liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P108_S2	Therefore, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately as compared to the ownership percentages due to specified preferred return rate thresholds and may be more or less than actual cash distributions received and more or less than what we may receive in the event of an actual liquidation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	In the event a basis difference is created between our underlying interest in the venture's net assets and our initial investment, we amortize such amount over the estimated life of the venture as a component of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	We separately report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income or loss of the joint ventures within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets because we are committed to provide further financial support to these joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P110_S1	The carrying amount of our investments in the Charlotte and Galveston/Houston joint ventures are less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that were greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Non-Company LP's percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	"Noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships" consist of outside equity interests in partnerships or joint ventures not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P111_S2	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P111_S3	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on the allocation provisions within the partnership or joint venture agreements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P112_S1	Estimates are used in the calculations of impairment losses, costs capitalized to originate operating leases, costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, and the values of deferred lease costs and other intangibles related to the acquisition of properties.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P112_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	Operating Segments - We focus exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P113_S1	We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the outlet centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P115_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P115_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are expensed when the project is no longer probable and, if significant, are recorded as abandoned pre-development costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	We also capitalize other costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and payroll and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P116_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P117_S2	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures for qualifying development activities until placed in service.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	Payroll and related costs and interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P120_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P121_S1	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P121_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in net income for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P123_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 33 years.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P124_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P124_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P124_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P124_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	As a part of acquisition accounting, the amount by which the fair value of our previously held equity method investment exceeds the carrying book value is recorded as a gain on previously held interest in acquired joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	Direct costs to acquire existing outlet centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P129_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P129_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $672,000 and $671,000 , respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	The restricted cash represents the cash proceeds from property sales that are being held by a qualified intermediary in anticipation of such amounts subsequently being invested in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges include deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including amounts paid to third-party brokers and payroll and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	Of the amounts capitalized during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 the following were related to payroll and related costs (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P133_S1	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	Deferred financing costs - Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P134_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	We have a wholly-owned captive insurance company that is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P135_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P136_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P136_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P137_S0	Fair value is determined using an income approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P137_S1	We recognized no impairment losses for our consolidated properties during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P137_S2	See Note 6 for discussion of the impairment of our unconsolidated joint venture at the Bromont, Quebec outlet center during 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	Rental Property Held For Sale - Rental properties designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P138_S1	We classify rental property as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P138_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P139_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P139_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P139_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P140_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, discount and capitalization rates, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P140_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P141_S0	Sales of Real Estate - For sales transactions meeting the requirements for full profit recognition, the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P141_S1	For sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale, if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract, profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P142_S0	Sales to entities in which we have or receive an interest are accounted for using partial sale accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P143_S0	For transactions that do not meet the criteria for a sale, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement, including put and call provisions, if present, and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement, profit-sharing arrangement, leasing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting, rather than as a sale, based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P144_S0	Some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P144_S1	In those cases, we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P145_S0	Discontinued Operations - Properties that are sold or classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations provided that the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity).
1004036_17_ITEM15_P146_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P146_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P146_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income (loss).
1004036_17_ITEM15_P147_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P148_S6	The tax years 2013 - 2016 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	With regard to the Company's unconsolidated Canadian joint ventures, deferred tax assets result principally from depreciation deducted under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") that exceed capital cost allowances claimed under Canadian tax rules.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	A valuation allowance is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P150_S1	We have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as we believe none of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P151_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were taxable as follows:
1004036_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded as a receivable in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets were approximately $46.8 million and $40.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P155_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P155_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	For certain tenants, we receive a fixed payment for common area maintenance ("CAM") which is recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P156_S1	When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses for the property.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P158_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	We receive development, leasing, loan guarantee, management and marketing fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates for services provided to properties held in joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P159_S1	Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates are recognized as revenue when earned to the extent of the third party partners' ownership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P159_S2	Development and leasing fees earned to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	Loan guarantee fees are recognized over the term of the guarantee.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P160_S1	Management fees and marketing fees are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P160_S2	Fees recognized from these activities are shown as management, leasing and other services in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P160_S3	Fees received from consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	Expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	See Note 3, for additional non-cash information associated with our acquisitions of rental property.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	A non-cash financing activity that occurred during the 2015 period related to a special dividend of $21.2 million that was declared in December 2015 and paid in January 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	Interest paid, net of interest capitalized was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We have a shareholder approved equity-based compensation plan, the Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (Amended and Restated as of April 4, 2014) (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P167_S1	We may issue non-qualified options and other equity-based awards under the Plan.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P167_S2	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	Foreign Currency Translation - We have entered into a co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada for which the functional currency is the local currency.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P168_S1	The assets and liabilities related to our investments in Canada are translated from their functional currency into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P168_S2	Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P168_S3	Our share of unrealized gains and losses resulting from the translation of these financial statements are reflected in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements - In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805).
1004036_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P169_S2	ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P169_S3	The update should be applied prospectively.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P169_S4	We plan to adopt ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 and do not expect the adoption to require any additional disclosures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	We believe most of our future acquisitions of operating properties will qualify as asset acquisitions and most future transaction costs associated with these acquisitions will be capitalized.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S2	Amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S3	The update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S4	The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P171_S5	We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, and the pronouncement will result in changes to our consolidated statements of cash flows such that restricted cash amounts will be included in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash and cash equivalents totals.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S1	This ASU modifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a VIE through a common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to be consolidated.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S2	Under this ASU, a decision maker would need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S3	As a result of this ASU, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S4	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S5	Since we have already adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-02 we are required to apply the amendments in this ASU, retrospectively to the beginning of 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P172_S6	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-17 to have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, the Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force), which finalizes Proposed ASU No. EITF-15F of the same name, and addresses stakeholders concerns regarding diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P173_S2	The ASU should be adopted using a retrospective transition approach.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P173_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance, but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P174_S1	This ASU will be applied on a prospective basis for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P174_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance, but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P175_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and may be applied on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P175_S3	The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, this standard eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method, an investor must restate its historical financial statements, as if the equity method had been used during all previous periods.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	Under the new guidance, at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method, any unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) ("AOCI") will be recognized through earnings.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S2	The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S3	The adoption of the guidance will be applied prospectively to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the new standards effective date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S4	Additional transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P176_S5	We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments ( ASU 2016-06 ), which will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	ASU 2016-06 clarifies that the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the clearly and closely criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P177_S2	ASU No. 2016-06 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P177_S3	Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing debt instruments using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P177_S4	We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P178_S1	ASU 2016-02, codified in ASC 842, amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P178_S2	ASU 2016-02 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P178_S3	Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect our significant operating lease commitments, primarily ground leases, will be required to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, resulting in an increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	We are continuing our evaluation, which may identify additional impacts this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P181_S2	ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P181_S3	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" and this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P183_S1	This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter, early adoption is permitted.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P183_S2	We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P183_S3	The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, cash flows or disclosures but may result in more disclosure surrounding the Company's plans for addressing significant upcoming debt maturities.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S2	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S3	In March, April and May 2016 the FASB issued the following amendments to clarify the implementation guidance: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S4	We will adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P184_S5	We have identified our revenue streams and are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, as the majority of our revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 or related amendments and modifications by the FASB will have a material impact on the amount of revenue we recognize in our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	Reclassifications - As a result of the adoption on January 1, 2016 of FASB ASU No. 2015-03 Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, our deferred debt origination costs and related accumulated amortization previously recorded in the line item deferred debt origination costs, net have been reclassified from assets to the respective debt line items within the liabilities section in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P185_S1	The reclassification decreased previously reported total assets and total liabilities by $11.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to the other partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P186_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P186_S2	At the time of acquisition, the property was subject to a $96.9 million construction loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% , that would have matured in May 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P186_S3	In September 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of the acquisition date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P187_S1	Prior to this transaction, we owned a 50% legal interest in the joint venture since its formation and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P187_S2	However, due to preferred equity contributions we made to the joint venture, and the returns earned on those contributions, our estimated economic interest in the book value of the assets was approximately 98% .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P187_S3	Therefore, substantially all of the earnings of the joint venture were previously recognized by us as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	The joint venture incurred approximately $260,000 in third-party acquisition related costs for the acquisition of the venture partner's interest that were expensed as incurred.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Savannah joint venture, we recorded a gain of $46.3 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	Non-cash investing activities related to the purchase of our partners' interest in the Savannah joint venture, include the assumption of debt totaling $96.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	In addition, rental property and lease related intangible assets and liabilities increased by a net of $46.3 million related to the fair value of our previously held interest in excess of our carrying amount; prepaids and other assets increased $250,000 and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2.1 million from the assumption of current assets and liabilities.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	In June 2016, we completed the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Glendale, Arizona, for a total cash price of approximately $40.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P190_S1	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P190_S2	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of June 30, 2016.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	The total cash price included $39.0 million to acquire the 40% ownership interest held by the equity partner in the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	We also purchased the remaining 2% noncontrolling ownership interests in the Westgate outlet center held in a consolidated partnership for a purchase price of $1.9 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	The acquisition of the noncontrolling ownership interest was recorded as an equity transaction and, as a result, the carrying balances of the noncontrolling interest were eliminated and the remaining difference between the purchase price and carrying balance was recorded as a reduction in additional-paid-in-capital.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	We funded the total purchase price with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	At the time of the acquisition, the property was subject to a $62.0 million mortgage loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75% and a maturity in June 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	In August 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan in full with proceeds from the public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2026.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P193_S1	We incurred approximately $127,000 in third-party acquisition related costs for the acquisition of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture that were expensed as incurred.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P193_S2	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Westgate joint venture, we recorded a gain of $49.3 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	Non-cash investing activities related to the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, include the assumption of debt totaling $62.0 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P194_S1	In addition, rental property and lease related intangible assets and liabilities increased by a net of $49.3 million related to the fair value of our previously held interest in excess of our carrying amount; prepaids and other assets increased $227,000 and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $5.0 million from the assumption of current assets and liabilities.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	The following table illustrates the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred to acquire the equity interests of the Savannah and Westgate properties at the acquisition date for the year ended 2016 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	The following table illustrates the aggregate fair value of the amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognized at the acquisition date for the Savannah and Westgate properties acquired during the year ended 2016:
1004036_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	The fair values were determined based on an income approach, using a rental growth rate of 3.0% , a discount rate between 7.50% and 8.25% , and a terminal capitalization rate between 5.75% and 7.0% .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P197_S1	The estimated fair values were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 12.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Company has finalized the valuations and completed the purchase price allocations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	During the measurement period, we adjusted the Westgate purchase price allocation based upon information that was received subsequent to the acquisition date that related to conditions that existed as of that date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P199_S1	This adjustment increased above market lease value by $1.6 million , and decreased buildings, improvements and fixtures by $5.6 million , below market lease value by $4.8 million , lease in place value by $628,000 and land by $150,000 .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	In September 2011, we purchased substantially all of the economic interests in The Outlets at Hershey, a 248,000 square foot outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P200_S1	A portion of the cash consideration paid to the buyer included a $6.2 million loan, which was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, collateralized by their remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P200_S2	In October 2014, the loan was canceled in exchange for this remaining ownership interest in the property.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	The following table sets forth the properties sold for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	(1) The rental properties did not meet the criteria set forth in the guidance for reporting discontinued operations (See Note 2), thus their results of operations have remained in continuing operations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P202_S1	(2) The proceeds from the sale of this unencumbered asset were used to pay down balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P202_S2	(3) We received combined net proceeds of $149.1 million of which $121.3 million was recorded in restricted cash as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P202_S3	The restricted cash represented the cash proceeds from property sales that were being held by a qualified intermediary for such amounts subsequently being invested in the 2016 period in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	In November 2016, we opened an approximately 349,000 square foot, wholly-owned, outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P203_S1	This outlet center features over 80 brand name and designer outlet stores.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	The table below sets forth our consolidated outlet centers under development as of December 31, 2016 :
1004036_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	(1) Amounts funded by our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	In September 2016, we purchased land in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area for approximately $11.2 million and began construction immediately on the development of a wholly-owned outlet center.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P206_S1	The outlet center will be located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P207_S0	In July 2016, we commenced construction on a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P208_S0	The equity method of accounting is used to account for each of the individual joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P208_S1	We have an ownership interest in the following unconsolidated real estate joint ventures:
1004036_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	(2) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, our economic interest in the venture's cash flow was greater than indicated in the Ownership column, which states our legal interest in this venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P209_S1	As of December 31, 2015, based upon the liquidation proceeds we would have received from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our estimated economic interest in the venture was approximately 98% .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P209_S2	Our economic interest may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including mortgage financing, partnership capital contributions and distributions, and proceeds from gains or losses of asset sales.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P209_S3	(3) The negative carrying value is due to the distributions of proceeds from mortgage loans and quarterly distributions of excess cash flow exceeding the original contributions from the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P210_S0	Fees we received for various services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures were recognized in management, leasing and other services as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P211_S0	Our investments in real estate joint ventures are reduced by the percentage of the profits earned for leasing and development services associated with our ownership interest in each joint venture.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P211_S1	Our carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures differs from our share of the assets reported in the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets - Unconsolidated Joint Ventures shown below due to adjustments to the book basis, including intercompany profits on sales of services that are capitalized by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P211_S2	The differences in basis (totaling $3.7 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively) are amortized over the various useful lives of the related assets.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P212_S0	In July 2014, we opened an approximately 398,000 square foot outlet center in Charlotte, North Carolina that was developed through, and is owned by, a joint venture formed in May 2013.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P212_S1	Construction of the outlet center, which commenced during the third quarter of 2013, was initially funded with equal equity contributions by the partners.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P212_S2	In November 2014, the joint venture closed on an interest-only mortgage loan for $90.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.45% .

1004036_17_ITEM15_P218_S1	Under the agreement, any outlet centers developed or acquired will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P218_S2	We have agreed to provide leasing and marketing services for the outlet centers and RioCan has agreed to provide development and property management services.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P219_S0	In October 2014, the co-owners opened Tanger Outlets Ottawa, the first ground up development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Canada.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P219_S1	In March 2016, the co-owners opened an approximately 28,000 square foot expansion related to an anchor tenant bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 316,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P219_S2	In 2016, the co-owners commenced construction on a 40,000 square foot expansion, which is expected to open during the second quarter of 2017.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P220_S0	In November 2014, the co-owners opened an approximately 149,000 square foot expansion to the existing Cookstown Outlet Mall, bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 308,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P221_S0	Other properties owned by the RioCan Canada co-owners include Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur and Bromont Outlet Mall.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P221_S1	Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur is approximately 116,000 square feet and the Bromont Outlet Mall is approximately 161,000 square feet.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P222_S0	Rental property held and used by our joint ventures are reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P222_S1	In such an event, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P223_S0	During 2016, the joint venture determined for its Bromont, Quebec outlet center that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of that property did not exceed the property's carrying value based on the reduction in the property's net operating income.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P223_S1	Therefore, the joint venture recorded a $5.8 million non-cash impairment charge in its statement of operations, which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P223_S2	The fair value was determined using the income approach whereby the joint venture considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P223_S3	Our share of this impairment charge, $2.9 million , was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in our consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P224_S0	In May 2016, the joint venture expanded the outlet center in Savannah by approximately 42,000 square feet, bringing the outlet center's total gross leasable area to approximately 419,000 square feet.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P226_S0	As described in Note 3, we acquired our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture in June 2016 and have consolidated the property for financial reporting purposes since the acquisition date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P227_S0	In February 2015, we sold our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the outlet center located in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin for approximately $15.6 million , representing our share of the sales price totaling $27.7 million less our share of the outstanding debt, which totaled $12.1 million .
1004036_17_ITEM15_P227_S1	As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represented the difference between the carrying value of our equity method investment and the net proceeds received.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	Condensed combined summary financial information of joint ventures accounted for using the equity method as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):
1004036_17_ITEM15_P229_S0	Deferred lease costs and other intangibles, net as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following (in thousands):

1004036_17_ITEM15_P267_S0	Our senior unsecured notes are publicly-traded which provides quoted market rates.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P267_S1	However, due to the limited trading volume of these notes, we have classified these instruments as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P267_S2	Our other debt is classified as Level 3 given the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P267_S3	Our unsecured term loan, unsecured lines of credit and variable interest rate mortgages are all LIBOR based instruments.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P267_S4	When selecting the discount rates for purposes of estimating the fair value of these instruments, we evaluated the original credit spreads and do not believe that the use of them differs materially from current credit spreads for similar instruments and therefore the recorded values of these debt instruments is considered their fair value.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P268_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P272_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P273_S0	In 2016 and 2015, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership were made as a result of the changes in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon the exercise of options and grants of share-based compensation awards, and additional units received upon the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership into an equal number of common shares of the Company.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P277_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method and the common shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P277_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , 501,446 , 859,450 and 644,850 units were excluded from the computation, respectively, because these units would not have been issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P277_S2	Notional units granted in 2010 were converted into 933,769 restricted common shares in January 2014.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P277_S3	The restricted common shares vested on December 31, 2014 and were considered participating securities through the vesting date.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P278_S0	The effect of dilutive common shares is determined using the treasury stock method whereby outstanding options are assumed exercised at the beginning of the reporting period and the exercise proceeds from such options and the average measured but unrecognized compensation cost during the period are assumed to be used to repurchase our common shares at the average market price during the period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P278_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , 141,300 , 227,400 and 259,000 options were excluded from the computation, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P278_S2	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P279_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P279_S1	The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P283_S0	The effect of dilutive common units is determined using the treasury stock method, whereby outstanding options are assumed exercised at the beginning of the reporting period and the exercise proceeds from such options and the average measured but unrecognized compensation cost during the period are assumed to be used to repurchase our common units at the average market price during the period.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P284_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P284_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , 141,300 , 227,400 and 259,000 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P285_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P285_S1	The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P285_S2	Unvested restricted common units that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P286_S0	When a common share is issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P286_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P287_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.

1004036_17_ITEM15_P288_S2	Shares remaining available for future issuance totaled 2,082,992 common shares.
1004036_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	The amount and terms of the awards granted under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors).

1004036_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Company, is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 12.9 million square feet, which were 97% occupied and contained over 2,600 stores representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	We also had partial ownership interests in 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company, through its ownership of the Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 94,560,536 units of the Operating Partnership and the Non-Company LPs collectively owned 4,995,433 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of our common shares.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	We also operate in a manner intended to enable us to preserve our status as a REIT, including, among other things, making distributions with respect to our then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of our taxable income each year.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company is a North Carolina corporation that was incorporated in March 1993 and the Operating Partnership is a North Carolina partnership that was formed in May 1993.

1004036_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	In October 2017, we opened a 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	The outlet center is located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	In September 2017, we opened a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	In October 2017, we successfully settled litigation with the estate of our former partner in the Foxwoods, Connecticut joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	In return for mutual releases and no cash consideration, the estate tendered its partnership interest to us.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Prior to this settlement, we had a 100% economic interest in the consolidated joint venture as a result of our preferred equity interest and the capital and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	In November 2017, we repaid the $70.3 million floating rate mortgage loan secured by the property with borrowings under our unsecured floating rate lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	In May 2017, we sold our Westbrook, Connecticut outlet center for approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	The net proceeds were used to repurchase our common shares.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	In July 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of $300.0 million of 3.875% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes").
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	The 2027 Notes priced at 99.579% of the principal amount to yield 3.926% to maturity.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	The 2027 Notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.875% per annum and mature on July 15, 2027.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S4	In August 2017, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2027 Notes, together with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit, to redeem all of our 6.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") (approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding).
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S5	The 2020 Notes were redeemed at par plus a make-whole premium of approximately $34.1 million .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P9_S6	In addition, we wrote off approximately $1.5 million of unamortized debt discount and debt origination costs related to the 2020 Notes.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	In January 2018, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, which increased the borrowing capacity from $520.0 million to $600.0 million and extended the maturity date from October 2019 to October 2021, with a one -year extension option.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also reduced the interest rate spread over LIBOR from 0.90% to 0.875% , and increased the incremental borrowing availability through an accordion feature on the syndicated line from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	Loan origination costs associated with the amendments totaled approximately $2.3 million .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	In February 2018, the consolidated joint venture that owns the Tanger outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi amended and restated the $60.0 million mortgage loan secured by the property.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	The amended and restated loan reduced the principal balance to $51.4 million , increased the interest rate from LIBOR + 1.75% to LIBOR + 1.80% and extended the maturity to April 2021, with a two -year extension option.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	In May 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Repurchases may be made through open market, privately-negotiated, structured or derivative transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions), or other methods of acquiring shares.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Company intends to structure open market purchases to occur within pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Company may, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate the repurchase of its shares under this authorization.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	During 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million common shares on the open market at an average price of $25.80 , totaling approximately $49.3 million exclusive of commissions and related fees.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P13_S4	The remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $75.7 million .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products, some of which are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Outlet centers enable retailers to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Outlet centers also enable manufacturers and brand name retailers to establish a direct relationship with their customers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that outlet centers present an attractive opportunity for capital investment as many retailers view the outlet concept as a profitable distribution channel.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	However, due to present economic conditions, the availability of multiple retail channels, and the potential for increased competition from other outlet center developers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Each of our outlet centers, except one joint venture property, carries the Tanger brand name.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	As one of the original participants in this industry, we have established long-standing relationships with many of our tenants that we believe is critical in developing and operating successful outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 740,159 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Ann Taylor, American Eagle Outfitters, Banana Republic Factory Store, Barneys New York, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach, Gap Outlet, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss Factory Store, J. Crew, Kate Spade New York, Lululemon Athletica, Michael Kors, Nike Factory Store, North Face, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour, Victoria s Secret, Vineyard Vines and others.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , no single tenant accounted for more than 8% of our leasable square feet or 7% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Because many of our tenants are large, multinational manufacturers or retailers, losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults historically have been immaterial.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 91% of our total revenues in 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues in 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Steven B. Tanger joined the Company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	the first publicly traded outlet center company.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 37 years.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , our consolidated outlet centers were 97% occupied with average tenant sales of $380 per square foot.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since 1981.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development, leasing and operation of outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing outlet centers, renovating and expanding selected outlet centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	Future outlet centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have historically been able to renew most leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract new tenants to replace underperforming tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe our 37 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support outlet centers with approximately 60 to 90 stores totaling at least 250,000 to 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 60% of the space in each outlet center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 60% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Keeping our outlet shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a re-merchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our long-standing retailer relationships and our focus on identifying emerging retailers allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and home goods.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	In order for our outlet centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our outlet centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, our consumer website, Internet advertising, social networks, mobile applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P43_S4	The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	We are a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S-3.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to issue debt or equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2018 .
1004036_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and when our next significant debt maturity, which is our unsecured term loan, occurs in 2021.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our outlet centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls, full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	However, we believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	Traditional full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers are often unable to provide such a variety of and depth of name-brand products at attractive prices.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Tenants of outlet centers are generally adverse to direct competition with major retailers and their own specialty stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	For this reason, our outlet centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, individual owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive marketing programs to drive traffic to the centers and relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to limit the number of new outlet centers developed each year.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We have one reportable operating segment.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	For financial information regarding our segment, see our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina where our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	As of February 1, 2018 , we maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 38 consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	As of February 1, 2018 , we had 287 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 40 business offices.
1004036_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	At that date, we also employed 353 part-time employees at various locations.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may be unable to develop new outlet centers or expand existing outlet centers successfully.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We continue to develop new outlet centers and expand existing outlet centers as opportunities arise.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development, these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	late completion because of construction delays, delays in the receipt of zoning, occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The economic performance and the market value of our outlet centers are dependent on risks associated with real property investments.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The economic performance and values of real estate may be affected by many factors, including changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, inflation, changes in government policies and regulations, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, consumer shopping preferences, local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area, the attractiveness of the properties to tenants, competition from other available space, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Real property investments are relatively illiquid.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our outlet centers represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our outlet centers in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we want to sell an outlet center, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price will exceed the cost of our investment.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Properties may be subject to impairment charges which can adversely affect our financial results.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, but not limited to, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analysis may not be achieved.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Also, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, discount and capitalization rates, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Dispositions may not achieve anticipated results.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	From time to time, we may strategically dispose of assets with the goal of improving the overall performance of our core portfolio.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	However, we may not achieve the results we originally anticipated at the time of disposition.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we are not successful at achieving the anticipated results, there is a potential for a significant adverse impact on our returns and our overall profitability.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We face competition for the acquisition and development of outlet centers, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or developments that we have identified.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We intend to grow our business in part through acquisitions and new developments.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, small owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These competitors may succeed in acquiring or developing outlet centers themselves.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive acquirers because they may have greater marketing and financial resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we pay higher prices for outlet centers, our profitability may be reduced.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Also, once we have identified potential acquisitions, such acquisitions are subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the negotiation of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to reach acceptable terms with the sellers or that these conditions will be satisfied.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be subject to environmental regulation.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property).
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks, whether in the United States, Canada or elsewhere, or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending, and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties, impair the ability of tenants to meet their obligations under their existing leases, limit our access to capital, increase our cost of raising capital and/or give rise to third party claims.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our earnings and therefore our profitability are dependent on rental income from real property.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our income and funds for distribution would be adversely affected if rental rates at our centers decrease, if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space in our outlet centers on economically favorable lease terms.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, the terms of outlet store tenant leases traditionally have been significantly shorter than in other retail segments.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that we will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are substantially dependent on the results of operations of our retailers.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' results of operations would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If the sales or profitability of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, whether due to a change in consumer preferences, legislative changes that increase the cost of their operations or otherwise, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Any resulting leasing delays, failures to make payments or tenant bankruptcies could result in the termination of such tenants' leases.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	A number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have voluntarily closed certain of their stores in recent years.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The bankruptcy of a major tenant or number of tenants may result in the closing of certain affected stores, and we may not be able to re-lease the resulting vacant space for some time or for equal or greater rent.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such bankruptcy, or the voluntary closings of a significant amount of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in a lower level of funds for distribution.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Certain of our properties are subject to ownership interests held by third parties, whose interests may conflict with ours and thereby constrain us from taking actions concerning these properties which otherwise would be in our best interests and our shareholders' interests.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We own partial interests in outlet centers with various joint venture partners.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The approval or consent of the other members of these joint ventures is required before we may sell, finance, expand or make other significant changes in the operations of these properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We also may not have control over certain major decisions, including approval of the annual operating budgets, selection or termination of the property management company, leasing and the timing and amount of distributions, which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing (for example, decisions as to whether to refinance or obtain financing, when and whether to pay down principal of any loan and whether and how to cure any defaults under loan documents) or other similar transactions with respect to such properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds our insurance policies on our outlet centers or the insurance policies of our tenants could subject us to lost capital and revenue on those outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of the risks to which our outlet centers are subject, including risks of terrorist attacks, war, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, are not insurable or may not be insurable in the future.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the insurance policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of our outlet centers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Under the terms and conditions of our leases, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons and contamination of air, water, land or property, on or off the premises, due to activities conducted in the leased space, except for claims arising from negligence or intentional misconduct by us or our agents.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Additionally, tenants generally are required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies acceptable to us.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the leased space.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	All of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Therefore, an uninsured loss or loss that exceeds the insurance policies of our tenants could also subject us to lost capital and revenue.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Shoppers may choose to spend a greater percentage of their disposable income to purchase goods through e-commerce or other retail channels, which could reduce the number of trips to our outlet centers and the average amount spent per visit.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such a change in consumer spending habits could adversely affect the results of operations of our retail tenants and adversely impact our percentage rents and ability to renew and release space at favorable rental rates.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our Canadian investments may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , through a co-ownership arrangement with a Canadian REIT, we have an ownership interest in four properties in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our operating results and the value of our Canadian operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the Canadian dollar.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Canadian ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Any or all of these factors may adversely impact our operations and financial results, as well as our overall business.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our success significantly depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Although we believe we have a strong management team with relevant industry expertise, the extended loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the securities markets' view of our prospects and materially harm our business.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Also, our success and the achievement of our goals are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that the cash provided by our operating activities will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operations, including the ability to fund the planned capital expenditures and potential new developments or acquisitions.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Further, there is the risk that we will not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company's failure to qualify as a REIT could subject our earnings to corporate level taxation.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We believe that we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that permits the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the Company has qualified or will remain qualified as a REIT.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, the Company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax for tax years prior to 2018) on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The Company's failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on the market price and marketability of our securities.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company is required by law to make distributions to our shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with the Company's qualification as a REIT, generally, the Company is required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding capital gains) each year.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership to make distributions to the Company's common shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The Company is allowed to satisfy the REIT income distribution requirement by distributing up to 80% of the dividends on its common shares in the form of additional common shares in lieu of paying dividends entirely in cash.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Recent changes in law significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses, including us.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation (the 2017 Tax Legislation ) has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Changes made by the 2017 Tax Legislation that could affect us and our shareholders from a U.S. federal income tax perspective include:
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax .
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury Department, IRS and courts, any of which could change the impact of the legislation.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	While some of the changes made by this tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Further federal or state legislative or other actions could adversely affect our shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Other future changes to tax laws may adversely affect the taxation of the REIT, its subsidiaries or its shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	These potential changes could generally result in REITs having fewer tax advantages, and may lead REITs to determine that it would be more advantageous to elect to be taxed, for federal income tax purposes, as a corporation.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Additionally, not all states automatically conform to changes in the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	This could increase the complexity of our compliance costs, and may subject us to additional tax and audit risk.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Company depends on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet its financial obligations, including dividends.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The Company's operations are conducted by the Operating Partnership, and the Company's only significant asset is its interest in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, the Company depends upon distributions or other payments from the Operating Partnership in order to meet its financial obligations, including its obligations under any guarantees or to pay dividends or liquidation payments to its common shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As a result, these obligations are effectively subordinated to existing and future liabilities of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Although the Operating Partnership presently is in compliance with these covenants, there is no assurance that the Operating Partnership will continue to be in compliance and that it will be able to make distributions to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our business operations and information technology systems may be attacked by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, whether through cyber attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We use information technology systems to manage our outlet centers and other business processes.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business to provide timely service to our customers and maintain our relationships with our tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release or loss of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability.
1004036_18_ITEM1A_P62_S5	As a result, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results and our share price could be adversely affected.
1004036_18_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments from the Commission for either the Company or the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of February 1, 2018 , our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers totaling 12.9 million square feet located in 22 states.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own interests in eight other outlet centers totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet through unconsolidated joint ventures, including four outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 740,159 square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	The outlet centers are generally located near tourist destinations or along major interstate highways to provide visibility and accessibility to potential customers.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that the outlet centers are well diversified geographically and by tenant and that we are not dependent upon any single property or tenant.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	The outlet center in Deer Park, New York is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	See "Properties - Significant Property" for further details.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have an ongoing strategy of acquiring outlet centers, developing new outlet centers and expanding existing outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of the cost of such programs and the sources of financing thereof.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	As of February 1, 2018 , of the 36 outlet centers in our consolidated portfolio, we own the land underlying 29 and have ground leases on seven.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	The following table sets forth information about the land leases on which all or a portion of the outlet centers are located:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Lease may be renewed at our option for additional terms of twenty years each.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	Generally, our leases with our outlet center tenants typically have an initial term that ranges from 5 to 10 years and provide for the payment of fixed monthly rent in advance.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P5_S1	There are often contractual base rent increases during the initial term of the lease.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the rental payments are customarily subject to upward adjustments based upon tenant sales volume.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P5_S3	Most leases provide for payment by the tenant of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, advertising and promotion expenses incurred by the applicable outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P5_S4	As a result, the majority of our operating expenses for the outlet centers are borne by the tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our consolidated outlet centers as of February 1, 2018 :
1004036_18_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table summarizes certain information with respect to our existing outlet centers in which we have an ownership interest as of February 1, 2018 .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P7_S1	Except as noted, all properties are fee owned:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P8_S0	(1) These properties or a portion thereof are subject to a ground lease.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P8_S1	(2) Based on capital contribution and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement, we expect our economic interest in the venture's cash flow to be greater than our legal ownership percentage.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P8_S2	We currently receive substantially all the economic interest of the property.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P8_S3	(3) Excludes the occupancy rate at our Fort Worth center which opened during the fourth quarter of 2017 and has not yet stabilized.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P8_S4	See notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P9_S0	See Note 6, to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P10_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2018 , scheduled lease expirations for our consolidated outlet centers, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P11_S0	(1) Excludes leases that have been entered into but which tenant has not yet taken possession, vacant suites, space under construction, temporary leases and month-to-month leases totaling in the aggregate approximately 1.3 million square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P11_S1	(2) Annualized base rent is defined as the minimum monthly payments due as of February 1, 2018 annualized, excluding periodic contractual fixed increases and rents calculated based on a percentage of tenants' sales.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P11_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P12_S0	Based on current market rental rates, we believe we will achieve overall positive increases in our average rental income for leases expiring in 2018 .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P12_S1	However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase from current levels, if at all.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P13_S0	The following table sets forth our year end occupancy and average annual base rent per square foot during each of the last five calendar years for our consolidated properties:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P14_S0	(1) Average annual base rent per square foot is calculated based on base rental revenues recognized during the year on a straight-line basis including non-cash adjustments to base rent required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and the effects of inducements and rent concessions.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P15_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the expiring leases for our consolidated outlet centers during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P16_S0	(1) Represents the percentage of total square footage at the beginning of each year that is scheduled to expire during the respective year.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P16_S1	(4) Excludes the outlet centers in Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch, and Barstow, which were sold during 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P16_S2	(5) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in 2014.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P17_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted average base rental rate increases per square foot on a straight-line basis (includes periodic, contractual fixed rent increases) for our consolidated outlet centers upon re-leasing stores that were turned over or renewed during each of the last five calendar years:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P18_S0	(2) Includes both minimum base rent and common area maintenance rents.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P18_S1	(4) Excludes Fort Myers outlet center, which was sold in 2016 and includes the Westgate and Savannah outlet centers, which are both now consolidated due to the acquisition of the other joint venture partners' interests during 2016 .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P18_S2	(5) Excludes the outlet centers in Kittery I II, Tuscola, West Branch, and Barstow, which were sold during 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P18_S3	(6) Excludes the Lincoln City outlet center, which was sold in 2014.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P19_S0	We believe that our ratio of average tenant occupancy cost (which includes base rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, advertising and promotions) to average sales per square foot is low relative to other forms of retail distribution.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P19_S1	The following table sets forth for tenants that report sales, for each of the last five calendar years, tenant occupancy costs per square foot as a percentage of reported tenant sales per square foot for our consolidated outlet centers:
1004036_18_ITEM2_P20_S0	Tenants The following table sets forth certain information for our consolidated outlet centers with respect to our ten largest tenants and their store concepts as of February 1, 2018 :
1004036_18_ITEM2_P21_S0	The Deer Park, New York outlet center is the only property that comprises 10% or more of our consolidated total assets.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P21_S1	No property comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P22_S0	Tenants at the Deer Park outlet center principally conduct retail sales operations.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P22_S1	The following table shows occupancy and certain base rental information related to this property as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 :
1004036_18_ITEM2_P23_S0	(1) Average annual base rent per square foot is calculated based on base rental revenues recognized during the year on a straight-line basis including non-cash adjustments to base rent required by GAAP and the effects of inducements and rent concessions.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P24_S0	Depreciation on the outlet centers is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P24_S1	We generally use estimated lives ranging from 33 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P24_S2	Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements, including tenant finishing allowances, which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P24_S3	Real estate taxes assessed on this outlet center during 2017 amounted to $4.6 million .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P24_S4	Real estate taxes for 2018 are estimated to be approximately $4.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM2_P25_S0	The following table sets forth, as of February 1, 2018 , scheduled lease expirations for the Deer Park outlet center assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal options:

1004036_18_ITEM2_P26_S2	The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P27_S0	The Company and the Operating Partnership are, from time to time, engaged in a variety of legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
1004036_18_ITEM2_P27_S1	Although the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had 36 consolidated outlet centers in 22 states totaling 12.9 million square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We also had 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling 2.4 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table provides information for our consolidated outlet centers regarding space re-leased or renewed during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	(1) Represents change in rent (base rent and common area maintenance) for leases for new stores that opened or renewals that started during the respective trailing twelve month periods, excluding temporary tenants and month to month leases.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	(2) Net average straight-line base rent is calculated by dividing the average tenant allowance costs per square foot by the average initial term and subtracting this calculated number from the average straight-line base rent per year amount.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	The average annual straight-line base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The average tenant allowance disclosed in the table above includes landlord costs.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net Income Net income decreased $132.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016 .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The majority of this decrease was due to a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $35.6 million in the 2017 period and a $95.5 million gain on the acquisition of our partners' equity interests in the Westgate and Savannah joint ventures in the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the tables below, information set forth for new developments and expansions represent our Fort Worth and Daytona Beach outlet centers, which opened in October 2017 and November 2016, respectively and our Lancaster expansion, which opened in September 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Acquisitions include our Westgate and Savannah outlet centers, which were previously held in unconsolidated joint ventures prior to our acquisitions of our venture partners' interest in each venture in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Properties disposed include our Westbrook and Fort Myers outlet centers sold in May 2017 and January 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Base Rentals Base rentals increased $15.6 million , or 5% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals decreased $1.4 million , or 12% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above their contractual breakpoints.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The decrease in percentage rentals is primarily due to a decrease in average sales per square foot for certain tenants for the rolling twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the rolling twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and due to annual increases in contractual breakpoints in certain leases.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $9.0 million , or 7% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Expense reimbursements represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance ("CAM"), insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Certain expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses for the property, and thus generally fluctuate consistently with the related expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Other expense reimbursements, such as promotional, advertising and certain CAM payments, represent contractual fixed rents and may escalate each year.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	See "Property Operating Expenses" below for a discussion of the decrease in operating expenses from our existing properties.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services decreased $1.4 million , or 36% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The decrease in management, leasing and other services is primarily due to having two fewer outlet centers in our unconsolidated joint ventures in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period prior to our acquisition of our venture partners' equity interests in the Westgate and Savannah outlet centers during 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	In connection with such acquisitions, we received no fees subsequent to the acquisition dates.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Offsetting the impact of the acquisitions was the addition of one new center in an unconsolidated joint venture, the Columbus outlet center, which opened in June 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Other Income Other income increased $532,000 , or 6% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of other income (in thousands):

1004036_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of property operating expenses (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The decrease in property operating expenses from existing properties was due to lower spending in the 2017 period for certain CAM and marketing expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses in the 2017 period decreased $2.7 million , or 6% compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to lower amounts of incentive compensation earned in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period and due to the 2016 period including compensation related to an executive officer termination and the death of a director totaling approximately $1.2 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Abandoned Pre-Development Costs During the 2017 period, we decided to terminate a purchase option for a pre-development stage project near Detroit, Michigan, and as a result, recorded a $528,000 charge, representing the cumulative related pre-development costs.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Depreciation and amortization decreased at our existing properties primarily due to due to tenant improvements and lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, becoming fully depreciated during the reporting periods.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest Expense and Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt Interest expense increased $4.2 million , or 7% , in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to (1) the impact of converting throughout 2016 $525.0 million of debt with floating interest rates to higher fixed interest rates, (2) the 30-day LIBOR, which impacts the interest rate associated with our floating rate debt, increasing relative to its level in the 2016 period and (3) the additional debt incurred related to the 2016 acquisitions of Westgate and Savannah.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	In August 2017, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2027 Notes, together with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit, to redeem all of our 6.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") (approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding).
1004036_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	The 2020 Notes were redeemed at par plus a make-whole premium of approximately $34.1 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the make-whole premium and the write off of approximately $1.5 million of unamortized debt discount and debt origination costs related to the 2020 Notes.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gain on Sale of Assets and Interests in Unconsolidated Entities In May 2017, we sold our Westbrook outlet center for approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.9 million .

1004036_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The purchase was funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	The joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and is consolidated in our financial results as of June 30, 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P31_S4	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Westgate joint venture, we recorded a gain of $49.3 million, which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to our joint venture partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	The joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and has been consolidated in our financial results since the acquisition date.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Savannah joint venture, we recorded a gain of $46.3 million, which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the Savannah joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening in April 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $8.9 million or 82% in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Equity in earnings from existing properties includes our share of impairment charges totaling $9.0 million in the 2017 period related to the Bromont and Saint-Sauveur outlet centers in Canada, and totaling $2.9 million in the 2016 period related to the Bromont outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures from new development is due to the incremental earnings from the Columbus outlet center, which opened in June 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The decrease in equity in earnings from properties previously held in unconsolidated joint ventures in 2016 is related to the Westgate and Savannah joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	We acquired our venture partners' interest in each of these joint ventures in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively, and have consolidated the results of operations of these centers since the respective acquisition date.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	In addition, net income in 2016 was impacted by:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	an increase in interest expense due to higher average borrowing levels and an increase in interest rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the tables below, information set forth for new developments includes our Foxwoods, Grand Rapids, Southaven and Daytona Beach outlet centers, which opened in May 2015, July 2015, November 2015 and November 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Acquisitions include our Westgate and Savannah centers, which were previously held in unconsolidated joint ventures prior to our acquisitions of our venture partners' interest in each venture in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Properties disposed includes the Kittery I II, Tuscola, and West Branch outlet centers sold in September 2015, the Barstow outlet center sold in October 2015 and the Fort Myers outlet center sold in January 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Base Rentals Base rentals increased $18.7 million, or 6%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of base rentals (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Base rental income generated from existing properties in our portfolio increased due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals, incremental rents from re-tenanting vacant spaces and multiple tenant rental step-ups.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Fees received from the early termination of leases, which are generally based on the lease term remaining at the time of termination, decreased as a result of fewer store closures throughout the portfolio in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Percentage Rentals Percentage rentals increased $1.1 million, or 10%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of percentage rentals (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Percentage rentals represents revenues based on a percentage of tenants' sales volume above their contractual break points.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in percentage rentals from existing properties is due to higher sales volume for certain existing tenants and also due to certain new tenants added to the existing properties whose sales exceeded their contractual break point.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Expense Reimbursements Expense reimbursements increased $7.4 million, or 6%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of expense reimbursements (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Expense reimbursements represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	For certain tenants, we receive a fixed payment for CAM with annual escalations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	While certain expense reimbursements generally fluctuate consistently with the related expenses, our expense recoveries for CAM as a percentage of expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to leases with fixed-CAM escalations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses for the property.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	See "Property Operating Expenses" below for a discussion of the increase in operating expenses from our existing properties.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Most, but not all, leases contain provisions requiring tenants to reimburse a share of our operating expenses as additional rent.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	However, substantially all of the leases for our new Foxwoods outlet center, which opened in May 2015, require tenants to pay a single minimum contractual gross rent and, in certain cases, percentage rent; thus, all minimum rents received for the Foxwoods outlet center are recorded as base rent and none are recorded to expense reimbursements.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Management, Leasing and Other Services Management, leasing and other services decreased $1.6 million, or 29%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of management, leasing and other services (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The decrease in management, leasing and other services is primarily due to the 2016 consolidation of both our Westgate and Savannah outlet centers due to the acquisitions of our venture partners' equity interests.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	This decrease was partially offset by development and leasing fees earned in 2016 from services provided to the Columbus joint venture which opened in June 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Other Income Other income increased $965,000, or 13%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses in the 2016 period increased $2.2 million, or 5% compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The 2015 period included the reversal of $731,000 of share-based compensation expense related to the October 2015 announcement that the Company s then Chief Financial Officer would retire in May 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, the 2016 period included increased legal, consulting and other professional fees compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	In addition, the 2016 period included compensation related to executive officer and director terminations of approximately $1.2 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $11.4 million, or 11%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of depreciation and amortization (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Depreciation and amortization costs decreased at existing properties as certain construction and development related assets, as well as lease related intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition price of acquired properties, which are amortized over shorter lives, became fully depreciated during 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization recorded as a result of a change in the estimated useful life of assets at various centers where demolition of existing buildings occurred in conjunction with renovations and expansions.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $6.5 million, or 12%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, due to (1) the conversion of $525.0 million of debt with floating interest rates to higher fixed interest rates, (2) the 30-day LIBOR, which impacts the interest rate we pay on our remaining floating rate debt, increasing relative to its level in the 2015 period, and (3) the additional debt incurred related to the Westgate and Savannah acquisitions.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Gain on Sale of Assets and Interests in Unconsolidated Entities The gain on sale of assets and interest in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $114.1 million, or 95%, in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Also, in the first quarter of 2016, we sold our Fort Myers outlet center for approximately $25.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $4.9 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	In February 2015, we recorded a gain of approximately $13.7 million from the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture that owned the Wisconsin Dells outlet center.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The purchase was funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Westgate joint venture, we recorded a gain of $49.3 million, which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia, distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to our joint venture partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	The joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and has been consolidated in our financial results since the acquisition date.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Savannah joint venture, we recorded a gain of $46.3 million, which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the Savannah joint venture, as a result of the significant appreciation in the property's value since the completion of its original development and opening in April 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $612,000 or 5% in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	The following table sets forth the changes in various components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Equity in earnings from existing properties for the 2016 period includes a $2.9 million asset impairment loss representing our share of the impairment loss recorded by the joint venture that owns the Bromont outlet center in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures from new developments is due to the incremental earnings from the Columbus outlet center, which opened in June 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	The equity in earnings from properties acquired or disposed in 2016 includes the impact of our acquisitions of the respective venture partners interests in Westgate and Savannah joint ventures in June 2016 and August 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	Equity in earnings from properties acquired or disposed in the 2015 period includes the impact of the sale of our interest in the Wisconsin Dells joint venture in February 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company section, the term, the Company, refers only to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company's business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company, which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Company does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Through its ownership of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management and control.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the Company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	We are a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration which expires in June 2018 that allows the Company to register unspecified, various classes of equity securities and the Operating Partnership to register unspecified, various classes of debt securities.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	As circumstances warrant, the Company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, develop new or existing properties, make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties and invest in existing or newly created joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The liquidity of the Company is dependent on the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Operating Partnership is a party to loan agreements with various bank lenders that require the Operating Partnership to comply with various financial and other covenants before it may make distributions to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger the Company's guarantee obligations, then the Company may be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	However, the Company's only material asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company believes the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its shareholders and to finance its continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership's ability to pay its distributions to the Company, which will in turn, adversely affect the Company's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	For the Company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	While historically the Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its shareholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the Company's own shares.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Based on our 2017 estimated taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $76.3 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	We distributed approximately $130.2 million during 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the Operating Partnership level, and the Company has guaranteed some of the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt as discussed below.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Because the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, the section entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	In May 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of our outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Repurchases may be made through open market, privately-negotiated, structured or derivative transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions), or other methods of acquiring shares.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The Company intends to structure open market purchases to occur within pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The Company may, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate the repurchase of its shares under this authorization.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	During 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million common shares on the open market at an average price of $25.80 , totaling approximately $49.3 million exclusive of commissions and related fees.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	The remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $75.7 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership section, the terms we , our and us refer to the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership and the Company together, as the text requires.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Property rental income represents our primary source to pay property operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	To the extent that our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to cover such non-recurring capital expenditures and acquisitions, we finance such activities from borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit or from the proceeds from the Operating Partnership's debt offerings and the Company's equity offerings.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2016 to 2017 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	incremental operating income from the opening of our two new wholly-owned outlet centers in Daytona Beach and Fort Worth, which opened in November 2016 and October 2017, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities from 2016 to 2017 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	partially offsetting the increase, cash used in 2016 to acquire our venture partners' interest in our Westgate joint venture and Savannah joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities from 2016 to 2017 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	offsetting the decrease, $49.4 million used to repurchase Operating Partnership units in 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The following table sets forth our changes in cash flows from 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	In 2016, our cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in operating income as a result of the net growth in leasable square feet in our portfolio of outlet centers and an increase in distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities from 2015 to 2016 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	We used restricted cash of $121.3 million in 2016, which was received in 2015, to repay a portion of our $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, which had an original maturity date in August 2018, and our $28.4 million deferred financing obligation, both of which related to the Deer Park outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Cash used for additions to rental property decreased in 2016 due to less new outlet center construction activity in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	The 2015 period included additions for our Foxwoods, Grand Rapids, and Southaven outlet centers, all of which opened during 2015, while the 2016 period primarily included construction at our Daytona Beach outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Distributions in excess of earnings increased in the 2016 period due the Columbus joint venture closing on an interest-only mortgage loan of $85.0 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The joint venture received net loan proceeds of $84.2 million and distributed them equally to the partners.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Our share of the distribution was $42.1 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Partially offsetting the above items were the acquisitions of our venture partners' interest in our Westgate joint venture and Savannah joint venture and fewer contributions in the 2016 period to our unconsolidated joint ventures as a result of less development activity in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities from 2015 to 2016 is primarily associated with the following:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Increase in cash distributions paid due to a special dividend that was paid in January 2016 and an increase in quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders in 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Increase in cash used for debt repayments, which included the repayments of the Deer Park $150.0 million floating rate mortgage loan, the $10.0 million unsecured note payable, the $7.5 million unsecured term note, the Westgate $62.0 million floating rate mortgage and our Savannah $98.0 million floating rate mortgage.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Cash used for the payment of a deferred financing obligation to a former partner at Deer Park, which increased our legal ownership to 100%.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Partially offsetting the above items was an increase in borrowings including the public offering of an aggregate $350 million of 3.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2026, netting proceeds of approximately $344.5 million and an additional $75.0 million in proceeds received from an amendment to our unsecured term loan to increase the size of the loan from $250.0 million to $325.0 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	In 2015, new borrowings for notes, mortgages, loans totaled $90.8 million and was primarily related to construction draws related to the Southaven and Foxwoods mortgages.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	In 2015, we also repaid the mortgages at our Hershey and Ocean City outlet centers, which totaled $46.6 million.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	We intend to continue to grow our portfolio by developing, expanding or acquiring additional outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	In the section below, we describe the new developments that are either currently planned, underway or recently completed.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	However, you should note that any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or FFO.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	See the section Funds From Operations in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for further discussion of FFO.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	We may also enter into letters of intent for the acquisition or disposition of properties.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in liquidity, net income or funds from operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	In October 2017, we opened a 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The outlet center is located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	In September 2017, we opened a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	In November 2017, the Company successfully settled litigation with the estate of our former partner in the Foxwoods, Connecticut joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	In return for mutual releases and no cash consideration, the estate tendered its partnership interest to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	Prior to this settlement, we had a 100% economic interest in the consolidated joint venture as a result of our preferred equity interest and the capital and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	In May 2017, we sold our Westbrook, Connecticut outlet center for approximately $40.0 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	The net proceeds were used to repurchase our common shares.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	From time to time, we form joint venture arrangements to develop outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" for a discussion of unconsolidated joint venture development activities.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	As of the date of this filing, we are in the initial study period for potential new developments.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	We may also use joint venture arrangements to develop other potential sites.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that these potential future developments will ultimately be developed.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	In the case of projects to be wholly-owned by us, we expect to fund these projects with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit and cash flow from operations, but may also fund them with capital from additional public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	For projects to be developed through joint venture arrangements, we may use collateralized construction loans to fund a portion of the project, with our share of the equity requirements funded from sources described above.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , unsecured borrowings represented 95% of our outstanding debt and 93% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , 15% of our outstanding debt , excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	In January 2018, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, which increased the borrowing capacity from $520.0 million to $600.0 million and extended the maturity date from October 2019 to October 2021, with a one -year extension option.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	We also reduced the interest rate spread over LIBOR from 0.90% to 0.875% , increased the incremental borrowing availability through an accordion feature on the syndicated line from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Loan origination costs associated with the amendments totaled approximately $2.3 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	The amended facility retains the $20.0 million liquidity line and includes a $580.0 million syndicated line.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $305.9 million available under our unsecured lines of credit after considering outstanding letters of credit of $6.0 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	In February 2018, the consolidated joint venture that owns the Tanger outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi amended and restated the $60.0 million mortgage loan secured by the property.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	The amended and restated loan reduced the principal balance to $51.4 million , increased the interest rate from LIBOR + 1.75% to LIBOR + 1.80% and extended the maturity to April 2021, with a two -year extension option.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	In December 2017, we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements, effective August 14, 2018 that fix the base LIBOR rate at an average of 2.20% on notional amounts totaling 150.0 million through January 1, 2021.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	In July 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of $300.0 million of our 3.875% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes").
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	The 2027 Notes priced at 99.579% of the principal amount to yield 3.926% to maturity.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	The 2027 Notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.875% per annum and mature on July 15, 2027.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S3	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $295.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S4	In August 2017, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2027 Notes, together with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit, to redeem all of our 6.125% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") (approximately $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding).
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S5	The 2020 Notes were redeemed at par plus a make-whole premium of approximately $34.1 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P111_S6	In addition, we wrote off approximately $1.5 million of unamortized debt discount and debt origination costs related to the 2020 Notes.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	In October 2017, we successfully settled litigation with the estate of our former partner in the Foxwoods, Connecticut joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	In return for mutual releases and no cash consideration, the estate tendered its partnership interest to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	Prior to this settlement, we had a 100% economic interest in the consolidated joint venture as a result of our preferred equity interest and the capital and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P112_S3	In November 2017, we repaid the $70.3 million floating rate mortgage loan secured by the property with borrowings under its unsecured floating rate lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	The following table details our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	New center development and expansion expenditures in the 2017 period, which include first generation tenant allowances, relate to construction expenditures for our new Fort Worth and Daytona Beach outlet centers and the expansion of our Lancaster outlet center.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The 2016 period included new center development and expansion expenditures for our Daytona Beach, Fort Worth, Lancaster, and Southaven outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	Major center renovations in the 2017 period included construction activities at our Riverhead, Rehoboth Beach, and Myrtle Beach Hwy 17 outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The 2016 period renovation expenditures included our Riverhead, Rehoboth Beach and Howell outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	Second generation tenant allowances increased due to the re-merchandising efforts to bring high volume tenants to 5 outlet centers during 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	(1) These amounts represent total future cash payments related to debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	(2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements, including the effects of our interest rate swaps.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P118_S2	All of our variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate, thus for purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt, the one month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2017 was used.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we have commitments of $2.2 million remaining as of December 31, 2017 related to contracts to complete construction, development activity at outlet centers, and other capital expenditures throughout our consolidated portfolio.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	These amounts would be primarily funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit but could also be funded by other sources of capital, such as collateralized construction loans or public debt and equity offerings.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S2	In addition, we have commitments to pay approximately $7.2 million in tenant allowances for leases that are executed but where the tenant improvements have not been constructed.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S3	Payments are only made upon the tenant opening its store, completing its interior construction and submitting the necessary documentation required per its lease.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S4	Contractual commitments to complete construction and development activity related to our unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to approximately $136,000 at December 31, 2017 , of which our portion was approximately $68,000 .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P119_S5	In addition, commitments related to tenant allowances at our unconsolidated joint ventures totaled approximately $1.0 million at December 31, 2017 , of which our portion was approximately $500,000 .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	Contractual commitments represent only those costs subject to contracts which are legal binding agreements as of December 31, 2017 and do not necessary represent the total cost to complete the projects.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	Our debt agreements contain covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P121_S2	We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	We believe our most restrictive financial covenants are contained in our senior, unsecured notes.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	A REIT that distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and that meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	Based on our 2017 estimated taxable income to shareholders, we were required to distribute approximately $76.3 million to our shareholders in order to maintain our REIT status as described above.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	We distributed approximately $130.2 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P124_S3	If in any taxable year the Company were to fail to qualify as a REIT and certain statutory relief provisions were not applicable, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax for tax years prior to 2018) on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2017 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	(1) The negative carrying value is due to the distributions of proceeds from mortgage loans and quarterly distributions of excess cash flow exceeding the original contributions from the partners and increases or decreases from the equity in earnings of the joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our joint ventures are generally subject to buy-sell provisions which are customary for joint venture agreements in the real estate industry.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	Either partner may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up period), which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or additional borrowings to acquire the other party's interest.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P127_S2	Under these provisions, one partner sets a price for the property, then the other partner has the option to either (1) purchase their partner's interest based on that price or (2) sell its interest to the other partner based on that price.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P127_S3	Since the partner other than the partner who triggers the provision has the option to be the buyer or seller, we do not consider this arrangement to be a mandatory redeemable obligation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	We provide guarantees to lenders for our joint ventures which include standard non-recourse carve out indemnifications for losses arising from items such as but not limited to fraud, physical waste, payment of taxes, environmental indemnities, misapplication of insurance proceeds or security deposits and failure to maintain required insurance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	For construction and term loans, we may include a guaranty of completion as well as a principal guaranty ranging from 5% to 100% of principal.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	The principal guarantees include terms for release based upon satisfactory completion of construction and performance targets including occupancy thresholds and minimum debt service coverage tests.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P128_S3	Our joint ventures may contain make whole provisions in the event that demands are made on any existing guarantees.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	In July 2014, we opened an approximately 398,000 square foot outlet center in Charlotte, North Carolina that was developed through, and is owned by, a joint venture formed in May 2013.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	In July 2017, the joint venture amended and restated the initial construction loan to increase the amount available to borrow from $70.0 million to $80.0 million and extended the maturity date until July 2020 with two one -year options.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	The amended and restated loan also changed the interest rate from LIBOR + 1.50% to LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P132_S3	At the closing of the amendment, the joint venture distributed approximately $14.5 million equally between the partners.

1004036_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	The loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	We are providing property management, marketing and leasing services to the joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	We have a 50 /50 co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	Under the agreement, any outlet centers developed or acquired will be branded as Tanger Outlet Centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P136_S2	Prior to July 2017, we provided leasing and marketing services for the outlet centers and RioCan provided development and property management services.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P136_S3	Subsequent to July 2017, we have agreed to provide marketing services for the outlet centers and RioCan has agreed to provide development, leasing and property management services.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	In October 2014, the co-owners opened Tanger Outlets Ottawa, the first ground up development of a Tanger Outlet Center in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	In March 2016, the co-owners opened an approximately 28,000 square foot expansion related to an anchor tenant bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 316,000 square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P137_S2	In 2016, the co-owners commenced construction on a 39,000 square foot expansion, which opened during the second quarter of 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	In November 2014, the co-owners opened an approximately 149,000 square foot expansion to the existing Cookstown Outlet Mall, bringing the total square feet of the outlet center to approximately 308,000 square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	Other properties owned by the RioCan Canada co-owners include Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur and Bromont Outlet Mall.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	Les Factoreries Saint-Sauveur is approximately 116,000 square feet and the Bromont Outlet Mall is approximately 161,000 square feet.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Rental property held and used by our joint ventures are reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	In such an event, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	During 2016, the joint venture determined for its Bromont, Quebec outlet center that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of that property did not exceed the property's carrying value based on the reduction in the property's net operating income.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P141_S1	Therefore, the joint venture recorded a $5.8 million non-cash impairment charge in its statement of operations, which equaled the excess of the property's carrying value over its fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P141_S2	The fair value was determined using the income approach whereby the joint venture considered the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P141_S3	Our share of this impairment charge, $2.9 million , was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in our consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	During 2017, the joint venture determined for its Bromont and Saint Sauveur, Quebec outlet centers that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of those properties did not exceed the property's carrying value based on the joint venture's expectations of the future performance of the centers.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	Therefore, the joint venture recorded an $18.0 million non-cash impairment charge in its statement of operations, which equaled the excess of the properties carrying value over its fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	The fair value was determined using a market approach considering the prevailing market income capitalization rates for similar assets.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	Our share of this impairment charge, $9.0 million , was recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in our consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	The following table details information regarding the outstanding debt of the unconsolidated joint ventures and guarantees of such debt provided by us as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	Fees we received for various services provided to our unconsolidated joint ventures during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , which we believe approximate current market rates, were recognized as follows (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	We consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIE").
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S2	For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, we consolidate the entity where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S3	Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S4	Our determination of the primary beneficiary considers various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P149_S5	If we do not evaluate these joint ventures correctly under the amended guidance, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that we do not control but may exercise significant influence on are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income or loss, cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, and the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from 3 to 33 years.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P152_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P152_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination date of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P152_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	We capitalize costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and salaries and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P156_S3	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P156_S4	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures with qualifying development activities.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Deferred charges includes deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized includes amounts paid to third-party brokers and salaries and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	The amount of salaries and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long-lived assets.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	Fair value is determined using an income approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	We recognized no impairment losses for our consolidated properties during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, for discussion of the impairment of our unconsolidated joint venture at our Bromont and Saint Sauveur, Quebec outlet centers during 2017 and our Bromont, Quebec outlet center in 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P161_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P165_S4	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on recently adopted accounting standards and new accounting pronouncements issued.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Funds From Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance for real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), of which we are a member.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P168_S2	Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	In addition, a portion of cash bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO or Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO"), which is described in the section below.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	We believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate our performance and that of our management.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	In addition, FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	FFO is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P170_S3	NAREIT has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	We present AFFO, as a supplemental measure of our performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S2	These further adjustments are itemized in the table below.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S3	You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S4	In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P174_S5	Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	We present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P175_S1	In addition, we believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate management s performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P175_S2	We use AFFO when certain material, unplanned transactions occur as a factor in evaluating management's performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and may use AFFO when determining incentive compensation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	AFFO has limitations as an analytical tool.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	Because of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only as a supplemental measure.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	(1) Assumes the Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership held by the noncontrolling interests are exchanged for common shares of the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	Each Class A common limited partnership unit is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's REIT status.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P179_S2	(2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents cash severance and accelerated vesting of restricted shares associated with the departure of an officer in August 2016 and the accelerated vesting of restricted shares due to the death of a director in February 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P179_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the reversal of certain share-based compensation awards previously recognized on awards not expected to vest due to the announcement that the Company s then Chief Financial Officer would retire in May 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	We present portfolio net operating income ("Portfolio NOI") and Same Center NOI as supplemental measures of our operating performance.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	Portfolio NOI represents our property level net operating income which is defined as total operating revenues less property operating expenses and excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on the sale of outparcels recognized during the periods presented.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P180_S2	We define Same Center NOI as Portfolio NOI for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired or subject to a material expansion or non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	We believe Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI are non-GAAP metrics used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure the operating performance of our properties because they provide performance measures directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income, FFO or AFFO.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P181_S1	Because Same Center NOI excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as non-cash adjustments, gains or losses on the sale of outparcels and termination rents; it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P181_S2	Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of our financial performance since they do not reflect the entire operations of our portfolio, nor do they reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P182_S1	Because of these limitations, Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be viewed in isolation to or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P182_S2	We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI only as supplemental measures.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	Below is a reconciliation of net income to Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI for the consolidated portfolio (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	(1) Non-cash items include straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on outparcel sales, as applicable.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	(2) Excluded from Same Center NOI:
1004036_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants' gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P185_S2	A component of most leases includes a pro-rata share or escalating fixed contributions by the tenant for property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	A portion of our rental revenues are derived from percentage rents that directly depend on the sales volume of certain tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	Accordingly, declines in these tenants' sales would reduce the income produced by our properties.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P186_S2	If the sales or profitability of our retail tenants decline sufficiently, whether due to a change in consumer preferences, legislative changes that increase the cost of their operations or otherwise, such tenants may be unable to pay their existing rents as such rents would represent a higher percentage of their sales.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	The current challenging retail environment could impact our business in the short-term as our operations are subject to the results of operations of our retail tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	While we believe outlet stores will continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for many brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	As is typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws, or may request modifications to their existing lease terms.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	During 2017, 13 tenants in our consolidated portfolio filed for bankruptcy protection, as compared to two tenants in 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S2	A number of retailers also engaged in brand wide restructurings during 2017 that resulted in store closings.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S3	In selected circumstances in 2017, we strategically agreed to short term lease modifications to manage occupancy.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S4	Partially as a result of these 2017 events, we currently expect our Same Center Net Operating Income for 2018 to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S5	Although we believe the number of bankruptcy filings, store closings and lease modifications in 2018 will be less than the levels experienced in 2017, we can give no assurance that the number of filings and store closings will actually be less.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P188_S6	If the level of bankruptcy filings, store closings and lease modifications during 2018 are at similar or greater amounts as those experienced in 2017, our results of operations and Same Center Net Operating Income could be further negatively impacted.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	Due to the relatively short-term nature of our tenants' leases, a significant portion of the leases in our portfolio come up for renewal each year.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	At January 1, 2017, we had approximately 1.5 million square feet, or 12% of our consolidated portfolio at that time coming up for renewal during 2017, excluding the Westbrook outlet center, which was sold in the second quarter of 2017, and 1.7 million square feet, or 13% , of our current consolidated portfolio will come up for renewal in 2018 .
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S2	During 2017 , we renewed 84% of the square feet that came up for renewal.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S3	In addition, we completed renewals and re-tenanted space totaling 1.7 million square feet at a blended 9% increase in average base rental rates compared to the expiring rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S4	While we continue to attract and retain additional tenants, there can be no assurance that we can achieve similar base rental rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P189_S5	In addition, if we were unable to successfully renew or re-lease a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Our outlet centers typically include well-known, national, brand name companies.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P190_S1	By maintaining a broad base of well-known tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States and Canada, we reduce our operating and leasing risks.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P190_S2	No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 8% of our square feet or 7% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P190_S3	Accordingly, although we can give no assurance, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released.
1004036_18_ITEM7_P190_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , occupancy at our consolidated outlet centers was 97% and 98%, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We are exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flows received from our Canadian joint ventures are either reinvested to fund ongoing Canadian development activity, if applicable, or converted to US dollars and utilized to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We generally do not hedge currency translation exposures.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the fair value of these contracts is a net asset balance of $5.3 million .
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The variable cash payments of interest rate swaps are based on the expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observed market interest rate curves.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In addition, credit valuation adjustments are considered in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk, but were concluded to not be significant inputs to the calculation for the periods presented.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , 15% of our outstanding debt, excluding variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore were subject to market fluctuations.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	An increase in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase of approximately $2.7 million in interest expense on an annual basis.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	A 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt of approximately $77.9 million and $69.1 million , respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our methodology in calculating the estimated fair value of debt.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments.
1004036_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.
1004036_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is set forth on the pages indicated in Item 15(a) below.
1004036_18_ITEM9_P0_S0	The information required by this Item 9 was previously reported in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Current Report on Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A amending such Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2015 and March 2, 2016, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer, James F. Williams (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2017 and concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose in its filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company's management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on our assessment and those criteria, the Company's management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2017 .
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	(c) There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure control procedures.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The Chief Executive Officer, Steven B. Tanger (Principal Executive Officer), and Vice President and Treasurer, James F. Williams (Principal Financial Officer) of Tanger GP Trust, sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures on December 31, 2017 and concluded that, as of that date, the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information the registrant is required to disclose in its filings with the Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the registrant's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	(b) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Operating Partnership's board of trustees, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	The Operating Partnership's management, with the participation of the Operating Partnership's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures designed to maintain the adequacy of the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting, including those policies and procedures that:
1004036_18_ITEM9A_P13_S0	(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Operating Partnership's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

1004036_18_ITEM12_P1_S0	The table below provides information as of December 31, 2017 with respect to compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance.
1004036_18_ITEM12_P2_S0	For each common share issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM12_P2_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM12_P3_S0	In the discussion below, the term "we" refers to the Company and the Operating Partnership together and the term "common shares" is meant to also include corresponding units of the Operating Partnership.

1004036_18_ITEM12_P4_S1	Because there is no exercise price associated with the 2016 and 2017 OPP awards, such restricted common shares are not included in the weighted average exercise price calculation.
1004036_18_ITEM12_P5_S0	(2) Represents common shares available for issuance under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan.
1004036_18_ITEM12_P6_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Incentive Award Plan, the Company may award restricted common shares, restricted share units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, deferred shares, deferred share units, share payments profit interests, and share appreciation rights.

1004036_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	These outlet centers were 97% occupied and contained over 2,600 stores, representing approximately 400 store brands.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	We also had partial ownership interests in 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	Accordingly, the descriptions of our business, employees and properties are also descriptions of the business, employees and properties of the Operating Partnership.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P108_S2	Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term Company refers to Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries and the term Operating Partnership refers to Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P108_S3	The terms we , our and us refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership together, as the text requires.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S1	Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S2	Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company, through its ownership of Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 94,560,536 units of the Operating Partnership and other limited partners (the "Non-Company LPs") collectively owned 4,995,433 Class A common limited partnership units.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S4	Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P109_S5	Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include its accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P110_S2	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Company currently consolidates the Operating Partnership because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the residual returns of the Operating Partnership that could be potentially significant.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	We consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S1	Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIE").
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S2	For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, we consolidate the entity where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S3	Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S4	Our determination of the primary beneficiary considers various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in an entity's governance, the size of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P112_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we did not have a joint venture that was a VIE.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	Investments in real estate joint ventures that we do not control but may exercise significant influence on are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P113_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our equity in the venture's net income or loss, cash contributions, distributions and other adjustments required under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	For certain of these investments, we record our equity in the venture's net income or loss under the hypothetical liquidation at book value ( HLBV ) method of accounting due to the structures and the preferences we receive on the distributions from our joint ventures pursuant to the respective joint venture agreements for those joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P114_S1	Under this method, we recognize income and loss in each period based on the change in liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P114_S2	Therefore, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately as compared to the ownership percentages due to specified preferred return rate thresholds and may be more or less than actual cash distributions received and more or less than what we may receive in the event of an actual liquidation.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	In the event a basis difference is created between our underlying interest in the venture s net assets and our initial investment, we amortize such amount over the estimated life of the venture as a component of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	We separately report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income or loss of the joint ventures within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets because we are committed to provide further financial support to these joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P116_S1	The carrying amount of our investments in the Charlotte and Galveston/Houston joint ventures are less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that were greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	Noncontrolling interests - In the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership reflects the Non-Company LP's percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership's units.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P117_S1	"Noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships" consist of outside equity interests in partnerships or joint ventures not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P117_S2	Noncontrolling interests are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon purchase price allocations.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P117_S3	Income is allocated to the noncontrolling interests based on the allocation provisions within the partnership or joint venture agreements.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P118_S1	Estimates are used in the calculations of impairment losses, costs capitalized to originate operating leases, costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, and the values of deferred lease costs and other intangibles related to the acquisition of properties.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P118_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	Operating Segments - We focus exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P119_S1	We aggregate the financial information of all outlet centers into one reportable operating segment because the outlet centers all have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to similar types and classes of customers.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	Rental Property - Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P120_S1	Buildings, improvements and fixtures consist primarily of permanent buildings and improvements made to land such as infrastructure and costs incurred in providing rental space to tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	The pre-construction stage of project development involves certain costs to secure land control and zoning and complete other initial tasks essential to the development of the project.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P121_S1	These costs are transferred from other assets to construction in progress when the pre-construction tasks are completed.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P121_S2	Costs of unsuccessful pre-construction efforts are expensed when the project is no longer probable and, if significant, are recorded as abandoned pre-development costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	We also capitalize other costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including interest, real estate taxes and payroll and related costs associated with employees directly involved.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P122_S1	Capitalization of costs commences at the time the development of the property becomes probable and ceases when the property is substantially completed and ready for its intended use.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	We consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P123_S1	We cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P123_S2	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized for the construction and development of properties is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	Interest costs are capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until construction is substantially complete.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P124_S1	This includes interest incurred on funds invested in or advanced to unconsolidated joint ventures for qualifying development activities until placed in service.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	Payroll and related costs and interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	We generally use estimated lives of 33 years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for land improvements and 7 years for equipment.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	Tenant finishing allowances are amortized over the life of the associated lease.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	Capitalized interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the constructed assets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P127_S2	Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while significant renovations and improvements which improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	Depreciation expense related to rental property included in net income for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was as follows (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in-place leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, if any.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P129_S1	We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 33 years.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	The values of below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods when the renewal is deemed probable to occur.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P130_S3	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangibles is written off.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P130_S4	The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	These cash flow projections may be derived from various observable and unobservable inputs and assumptions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P131_S2	Also, we may utilize third-party valuation specialists.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	As a part of acquisition accounting, the amount by which the fair value of our previously held equity method investment exceeds the carrying book value is recorded as a gain on previously held interest in acquired joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	Direct costs to acquire existing outlet centers are expensed as incurred.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash - All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	Cash balances at a limited number of banks may periodically exceed insurable amounts.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	We believe that we mitigate our risk by investing in or through major financial institutions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P135_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had cash equivalent investments in highly liquid money market accounts at major financial institutions of $3.0 million and $672,000 , respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	The restricted cash represents the cash proceeds from property sales that are being held by a qualified intermediary in anticipation of such amounts subsequently being invested in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Deferred Charges - Deferred charges include deferred lease costs and other intangible assets consisting of fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases and are amortized over the expected lease term.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P137_S1	Deferred lease costs capitalized, including amounts paid to third-party brokers and payroll and related costs of employees directly involved in originating leases for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	Of the amounts capitalized during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 the following were related to payroll and related costs (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	The amount of payroll and related costs capitalized is based on our estimate of the time and amount of costs directly related to originating leases.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P139_S1	Deferred lease costs and other intangible assets also include the value of leases and origination costs deemed to have been acquired in real estate acquisitions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Deferred financing costs - Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are amortized over the terms of the respective loans.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	Unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to expense when debt is retired before the maturity date.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	We have a wholly-owned captive insurance company that is responsible for losses up to certain deductible levels per occurrence for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P141_S1	Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses and include estimates of costs incurred, both reported and unreported.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P142_S1	In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset's carrying amount, and if less than such carrying amount, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	Fair value is determined using an income approach whereby we consider the prevailing market income capitalization rates and stabilized net operating income projections.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P143_S1	We recognized no impairment losses for our consolidated properties during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P143_S2	See Note 6 for discussion of the impairment of our unconsolidated joint ventures at the Bromont, Quebec and Saint Sauveur, Quebec outlet centers.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Rental Property Held For Sale - Rental properties designated as held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	We classify rental property as held for sale when our Board of Directors approves the sale of the assets and it meets the requirements of current accounting guidance.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	Subsequent to this classification, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	Impairment of Investments - On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	An investment is impaired only if management's estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investments, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P145_S2	To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	Our estimates of value for each joint venture investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, estimated hold period, terminal capitalization rates, demand for space, competition for tenants, discount and capitalization rates, changes in market rental rates and operating costs of the property.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the values estimated by us in our impairment analysis may not be realized.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	Sales of Real Estate - For sales transactions meeting the requirements for full profit recognition, the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P147_S1	For sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale, if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract, profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	Sales to entities in which we have or receive an interest are accounted for using partial sale accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	For transactions that do not meet the criteria for a sale, we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement, including put and call provisions, if present, and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement, profit-sharing arrangement, leasing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting, rather than as a sale, based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	Some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P150_S1	In those cases, we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	Discontinued Operations - Properties that are sold or classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations provided that the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	Derivatives - We selectively enter into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	The notional amounts of such agreements are used to measure the interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to loss.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	None of these agreements are used for speculative or trading purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at their fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S1	We also measure the effectiveness, as defined by the relevant accounting guidance, of all derivatives.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S2	We formally document our derivative transactions, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S3	At inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we assess the effectiveness of derivatives used to hedge transactions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S4	If a cash flow hedge is deemed effective, we record the change in fair value in other comprehensive income (loss).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P153_S5	If after assessment it is determined that a portion of the derivative is ineffective, then that portion of the derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	Income Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S1	A REIT which distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S2	We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT and to distribute substantially all of the Company's taxable income to its shareholders.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Company's consolidated financial statements for Federal income taxes.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S4	As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year with respect to the Operating Partnership is included in the income tax returns for the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S5	In addition, we continue to evaluate uncertain tax positions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P154_S6	The tax years 2014 - 2017 remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	With regard to the Company's unconsolidated Canadian joint ventures, deferred tax assets result principally from depreciation deducted under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") that exceed capital cost allowances claimed under Canadian tax rules.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	A valuation allowance is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P156_S1	We have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as we believe none of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	For income tax purposes, distributions paid to the Company's common shareholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P157_S1	Dividends per share for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were taxable as follows:
1004036_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	The following reconciles net income available to the Company's shareholders to taxable income available to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	Revenue Recognition - Base rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P159_S1	Straight-line rent adjustments recorded as a receivable in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets were approximately $51.9 million and $46.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	As a provision of a tenant lease, if we make a cash payment to the tenant for purposes other than funding the construction of landlord assets, we defer the amount of such payments as a lease incentive.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	We amortize lease incentives as a reduction of base rental revenue over the term of the lease.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P161_S1	Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants' sales volume ( percentage rentals ) and reimbursement of the tenants' share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P161_S2	Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P161_S3	Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	For certain tenants, we receive a fixed payment for common area maintenance ("CAM") which is recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses for the property.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time the payment is receivable until the tenant vacates the space.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P164_S1	If a tenant terminates its lease prior to the original contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	We receive development, leasing, loan guarantee, management and marketing fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates for services provided to properties held in joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P165_S1	Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates are recognized as revenue when earned to the extent of the third party partners' ownership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P165_S2	Development and leasing fees earned to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	Loan guarantee fees are recognized over the term of the guarantee.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P166_S1	Management fees and marketing fees are recognized as revenue when earned.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P166_S2	Fees recognized from these activities are shown as management, leasing and other services in our consolidated statements of operations.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P166_S3	Fees received from consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk - We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our tenants.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	Although the tenants operate principally in the retail industry, the properties are geographically diverse.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P168_S1	No single tenant accounted for 10% or more of combined base and percentage rental income or gross leasable area during 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	Supplemental Cash Flow Information - We purchase capital equipment and incur costs relating to construction of new facilities, including tenant finishing allowances.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P169_S1	Expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	See Note 3, for additional non-cash information associated with our acquisitions of rental property.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	A non-cash financing activity that occurred during the 2015 period related to a special dividend of $21.2 million that was declared in December 2015 and paid in January 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	Interest paid, net of interest capitalized was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation - We have a shareholder approved equity-based compensation plan, the Incentive Award Plan of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and Tanger Properties Limited Partnership (Amended and Restated as of April 4, 2014) (the "Plan"), which covers our independent directors, officers and our employees.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P173_S1	We may issue non-qualified options and other equity-based awards under the Plan.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P173_S2	We account for our equity-based compensation plan under the fair value provisions of the relevant accounting guidance and we estimate expected forfeitures in determining compensation cost.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Foreign Currency Translation - We have entered into a co-ownership agreement with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to develop and acquire outlet centers in Canada for which the functional currency is the local currency.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P174_S1	The assets and liabilities related to our investments in Canada are translated from their functional currency into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P174_S2	Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P174_S3	Our share of unrealized gains and losses resulting from the translation of these financial statements are reflected in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	Recently adopted accounting standards - In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S1	ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S2	ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S3	The update should be applied prospectively.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S4	We early adopted this standard on January 1, 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P175_S5	We believe most of our future acquisitions of operating properties will qualify as asset acquisitions and certain transaction costs associated with these acquisitions will be capitalized.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, the Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force), which finalizes Proposed ASU No. EITF-15F of the same name, and addresses stakeholders concerns regarding diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S1	ASU 2016-15 clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity in practice with respect to (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distributions received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S3	The ASU should be adopted using a retrospective transition approach.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S4	We early adopted ASU 2016-15 during the third quarter of 2017, with retrospective application to our consolidated statements of cash flows.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P176_S5	For distributions received from equity method investees, we have chosen the cumulative-earnings approach, which is also our current policy for these distributions.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P177_S0	ASU 2016-15 requires debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs to be classified as cash outflows for financing activities.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P177_S1	As such, the make-whole premium related to the 2020 notes has been classified as a financing activity.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	The retrospective application of ASU 2016-15 had no impact on any of the prior periods presented.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S0	Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted - In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S1	The new guidance will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S2	It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S3	It is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S4	The amendments can be adopted immediately in any interim or annual period (including the current period).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S5	The mandatory effective date for calendar year-end public companies is January 1, 2019.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P179_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance, but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	ASU 2017-05 clarifies the definition of an in-substance nonfinancial asset and changes the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets to be more consistent with the accounting for a sale of a business pursuant to ASU 2017-01.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P180_S1	This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 using a full retrospective or modified retrospective method and is required to be adopted in conjunction with ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" discussed below.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P180_S2	We adopted ASU 2017-05 effective January 1, 2018, along with our adoption of ASU 2014-09, using the modified retrospective approach.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	We do not actively sell operating properties as part of our core business strategy and, accordingly, the sale of properties does not generally constitute a significant part of our revenue and cash flows.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P181_S1	Subsequent to adoption, we believe most of our future contributions of nonfinancial assets to our joint ventures where we cease to have a controlling financial interest, if any, will result in the recognition of a full gain or loss as if we sold 100% of the nonfinancial asset and we will also measure our retained interest at fair value.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S2	Amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S3	The update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S4	The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P182_S5	We adopted this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, and the pronouncement will result in changes to our consolidated statements of cash flows such that restricted cash amounts will be included in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash and cash equivalents totals.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in September 2017 within ASU 2017-13 (collectively, Topic 842).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	Topic 842, amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P183_S2	Topic 842 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P183_S3	Early adoption of Topic 842 as of its issuance is permitted.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P183_S4	We will adopt Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect our significant operating lease commitments, primarily ground leases, will be required to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, resulting in an increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	Upon adoption, we anticipate separating lease components from nonlease components, which will be evaluated under Topic 606, as described below.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P185_S2	We are continuing our evaluation, which may identify additional impacts this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606, as amended, (collectively, Topic 606).
1004036_18_ITEM15_P186_S1	Topic 606 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P186_S2	Topic 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification, including real estate lease contracts, which the majority of our revenue is derived.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	The guidance also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets, such as property, including real estate.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	We are required to adopt the new pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	We adopted Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P188_S1	Our revenues that will be impacted by this standard primarily include revenue from management, marketing, development, and leasing fees for services performed related to various joint ventures that we manage and other ancillary income earned at our properties.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	While the total revenue recognized over time would not differ under the new guidance, the recognition pattern may be different under the new guidance.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P189_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, these revenues were approximately 3% of consolidated revenue, for both periods.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P189_S2	As a result, the adoption of Topic 606 or related amendments and modifications by the FASB will not have a material impact on the amount of revenue we recognize in our consolidated financial statements and we will not have a cumulative catch-up upon the adoption of this standard.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	In November 2017, we successfully settled litigation with the estate of our former partner in the Foxwoods, Connecticut joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P190_S1	In return for mutual releases and no cash consideration, the estate tendered its partnership interest to the Company.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P190_S2	Prior to this settlement, we had a 100% economic interest in the consolidated joint venture as a result of our preferred equity interest and the capital and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P190_S3	See Note 5 for further details with regards to the Foxwoods property.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	In August 2016, the Savannah joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Pooler, Georgia, distributed all outparcels along with $15.0 million in cash consideration to the other partner in exchange for the partner's ownership interest.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P191_S1	We contributed the $15.0 million in cash consideration to the joint venture, which we funded with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P191_S2	At the time of acquisition, the property was subject to a $96.9 million construction loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65% , that would have matured in May 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P191_S3	In September 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of the acquisition date.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P192_S1	Prior to this transaction, we owned a 50% legal interest in the joint venture since its formation and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P192_S2	However, due to preferred equity contributions we made to the joint venture, and the returns earned on those contributions, our estimated economic interest in the book value of the assets was approximately 98% .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P192_S3	Therefore, substantially all of the earnings of the joint venture were previously recognized by us as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P193_S1	The joint venture incurred approximately $260,000 in third-party acquisition related costs for the acquisition of the venture partner's interest that were expensed as incurred.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P193_S2	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Savannah joint venture, we recorded a gain of $46.3 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	Non-cash investing activities related to the purchase of our partners' interest in the Savannah joint venture, include the assumption of debt totaling $96.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P194_S1	In addition, rental property and lease related intangible assets and liabilities increased by a net of $46.3 million related to the fair value of our previously held interest in excess of our carrying amount; prepaids and other assets increased $250,000 and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2.1 million from the assumption of current assets and liabilities.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	In June 2016, we completed the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, which owned the outlet center in Glendale, Arizona, for a total cash price of approximately $40.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	Prior to the transaction, we owned a 58% interest in the Westgate joint venture since its formation in 2012 and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P195_S2	The former joint venture is now wholly-owned by us and was consolidated in our financial results as of June 30, 2016.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	The total cash price included $39.0 million to acquire the 40% ownership interest held by the equity partner in the joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P196_S1	We also purchased the remaining 2% noncontrolling ownership interests in the Westgate outlet center held in a consolidated partnership for a purchase price of $1.9 million .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P196_S2	The acquisition of the noncontrolling ownership interest was recorded as an equity transaction and, as a result, the carrying balances of the noncontrolling interest were eliminated and the remaining difference between the purchase price and carrying balance was recorded as a reduction in additional-paid-in-capital.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	We funded the total purchase price with borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P197_S1	At the time of the acquisition, the property was subject to a $62.0 million mortgage loan, with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.75% and a maturity in June 2017.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P197_S2	In August 2016, we repaid the mortgage loan in full with proceeds from the public offering of $250.0 million in senior notes due 2026.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	There was no contingent consideration associated with this acquisition.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	We incurred approximately $127,000 in third-party acquisition related costs for the acquisition of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture that were expensed as incurred.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P198_S2	As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in the Westgate joint venture, we recorded a gain of $49.3 million which represented the difference between the carrying book value and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment in the joint venture.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	Non-cash investing activities related to the purchase of our partners' interest in the Westgate joint venture, include the assumption of debt totaling $62.0 million .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P199_S1	In addition, rental property and lease related intangible assets and liabilities increased by a net of $49.3 million related to the fair value of our previously held interest in excess of our carrying amount; prepaids and other assets increased $227,000 and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $5.0 million from the assumption of current assets and liabilities.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	The following table illustrates the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred to acquire the equity interests of the Savannah and Westgate properties at the acquisition date for the year ended 2016 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	The following table illustrates the aggregate fair value of the amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognized at the acquisition date for the Savannah and Westgate properties acquired during the year ended 2016:
1004036_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	The fair values were determined based on an income approach, using a rental growth rate of 3.0% , a discount rate between 7.50% and 8.25% , and a terminal capitalization rate between 5.75% and 7.0% .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P202_S1	The estimated fair values were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 12.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company has finalized the valuations and completed the purchase price allocations.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	During the measurement period, we adjusted the Westgate purchase price allocation based upon information that was received subsequent to the acquisition date that related to conditions that existed as of that date.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P204_S1	This adjustment increased above market lease value by $1.6 million , and decreased buildings, improvements and fixtures by $5.6 million , below market lease value by $4.8 million , lease in place value by $628,000 and land by $150,000 .
1004036_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	The following table sets forth the properties sold for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P206_S0	(1) The rental properties did not meet the criteria set forth in the guidance for reporting discontinued operations (See Note 2), thus their results of operations have remained in continuing operations.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	(2) We received combined net proceeds of $149.1 million of which $121.3 million was recorded in restricted cash as of December 31, 2015.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P206_S2	The restricted cash represented the cash proceeds from property sales that were being held by a qualified intermediary for such amounts subsequently being invested in the 2016 period in a tax efficient manner under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	In October 2017, we opened a 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P207_S1	The outlet center is located within the 279-acre Champions Circle mixed-use development adjacent to Texas Motor Speedway.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	In September 2017, we opened a 123,000 square foot expansion of our outlet center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	In November 2016, we opened an approximately 352,000 square foot, wholly-owned, outlet center in Daytona Beach, Florida.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	In May 2015, we opened an approximately 312,000 square foot outlet center at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	Prior to the settlement of the litigation with our former joint venture partner related to the Foxwoods property as described further in Note 3 above, we owned a controlling interest in the joint venture which was consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	In July 2015, we opened an approximately 352,000 square foot wholly-owned outlet center near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	In November 2015, we opened an approximately 320,000 square foot outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P213_S1	We own a controlling interest in the joint venture which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P214_S0	As of December 31, 2017, based upon the liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value, our economic interest would represent substantially all of the economic benefit of the property.

1004036_18_ITEM15_P281_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership owned by Non-Company LPs as discussed in Note 2.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P281_S1	The noncontrolling interests in other consolidated partnerships consist of outside equity interests in partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company or the Operating Partnership that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company and Operating Partnership because the Operating Partnership exercises control over the entities that own the properties.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P282_S0	In 2017 and 2016, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership were made as a result of the changes in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership from additional units received in connection with the Company's issuance of common shares upon the exercise of options and grants of share-based compensation awards, additional units received upon the exchange of Class A common limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership into an equal number of common shares of the Company, and units repurchased by the Operating Partnership as a result of the Company's repurchase of its outstanding common shares.

1004036_18_ITEM15_P284_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators in computing earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1004036_18_ITEM15_P285_S0	We determine diluted earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average shares that would have been outstanding assuming all potentially dilutive securities were converted into common shares at the earliest date possible.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P286_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method and the common shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P286_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , 603,411 , 501,446 and 859,450 units were excluded from the computation, respectively, because these units would not have been issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or because they were anti-dilutive.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P287_S0	The effect of dilutive common shares is determined using the treasury stock method whereby outstanding options are assumed exercised at the beginning of the reporting period and the exercise proceeds from such options and the average measured but unrecognized compensation cost during the period are assumed to be used to repurchase our common shares at the average market price during the period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P287_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , 169,000 , 141,300 and 227,400 options were excluded from the computation, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P287_S2	The assumed exchange of the partnership units held by the Non-Company LPs as of the beginning of the year, which would result in the elimination of earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership, would have no impact on earnings per share since the allocation of earnings to a common limited partnership unit, as if exchanged, is equivalent to earnings allocated to a common share.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P288_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P288_S1	The impact of these unvested restricted common share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted common share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted common shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P288_S2	Unvested restricted common shares that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per share computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.

1004036_18_ITEM15_P291_S0	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method and the common shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P291_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , 2015 , 603,411 , 501,446 and 859,450 units were excluded from the computation, respectively, because these units would not have been issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period or because they were anti-dilutive.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P291_S2	The notional units are considered contingently issuable common units and are included in earnings per unit if the effect is dilutive using the treasury stock method.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P292_S0	The effect of dilutive common units is determined using the treasury stock method, whereby outstanding options are assumed exercised at the beginning of the reporting period and the exercise proceeds from such options and the average measured but unrecognized compensation cost during the period are assumed to be used to repurchase our common units at the average market price during the period.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P293_S0	The market price of a common unit is considered to be equivalent to the market price of a Company common share.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P293_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , 169,000 , 141,300 and 227,400 options were excluded from the computation, respectively.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P294_S0	Certain of the Company's unvested restricted common share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P294_S1	The impact of the corresponding unvested restricted unit awards on earnings per unit has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted unit awards based on distributions declared and the unvested restricted units' participation rights in undistributed earnings.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P294_S2	Unvested restricted common units that do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in the diluted earnings per unit computation if the effect is dilutive, using the treasury stock method.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P295_S0	When a common share is issued by the Company, the Operating Partnership issues one corresponding unit of partnership interest to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P295_S1	Therefore, when the Company grants an equity based award, the Operating Partnership treats each award as having been granted by the Operating Partnership.

1004036_18_ITEM15_P302_S2	For the restricted shares issued to our chief executive officer during 2017, 2016 and 2015, the restricted share agreements require him to hold the shares for a minimum of three years following each applicable vesting date thereof.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P302_S3	Compensation expense related to the amortization of the deferred compensation is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the restricted shares.
1004036_18_ITEM15_P302_S4	For all of the restricted common share awards described above, the grant date fair value of the award was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company's common shares on the day prior to the grant date and the associated compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of each grant.
