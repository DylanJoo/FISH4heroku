1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	Garmin s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin s engineering and manufacturing teams.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	Garmin s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 2,340 people worldwide as of December 25, 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S2	Garmin s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S3	Garmin s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S4	Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin s success.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P141_S5	Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	Below is a table of Garmin s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	Garmin believes that one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its Sijhih, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than the legacy n vifone products, which are manufactured by one or more third parties as part of the Garmin-Asus strategic alliance, a few select marine products (VHF radios and AIS receivers), and our accessory products, all of which are also manufactured by one or more third parties.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P144_S1	In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, improved quality and yields, lower cost and better value for customers.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P145_S1	Garmin s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and rugged.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	Operating our own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	Operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows Garmin to quickly adjust the mix of product production, helping to foster faster delivery response to the customer.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	Garmin s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P148_S2	In addition, Garmin s aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	This certification recognizes that Garmin s UK and Taiwan subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components, including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ), and certain application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs ) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, the Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	Our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand for automotive/mobile products during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the Father s Day/graduation buying season.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P153_S3	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P154_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P155_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P155_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P155_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	As of January 21, 2010, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 450 patents and 300 trademark registrations.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P156_S1	Garmin was selected as a constituent of the 2010/2011 Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P157_S1	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P158_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P159_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P160_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	In accordance with Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P160_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P160_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P160_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P161_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P161_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P162_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P162_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P163_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P163_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P164_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P164_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P164_S2	Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P165_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P166_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P166_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System ( EMS ) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facility.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	Regulatory and Green Procurement demands from our customers are also increasing, particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	As of December 25, 2010, Garmin had 8,897 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,470 were in the United States, 72 were in Canada, 4,419 were in Taiwan, 725 were in Europe, and 211 were in other global locations.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 62% of our revenues and is maturing.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2011 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices (PNDs) that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past year that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P17_S7	From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V. NAVTEQ Corporation is owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may have additional tax liabilities.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P62_S6	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S5	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P68_S3	The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The shutdown of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Any future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning System products and would have a material negative effect on our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of Global Positioning System satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government that provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Because of the increasing commercial applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	However, in a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. is committed to supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will continue providing it free from direct user fees.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Some of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	WAAS is operated by the FAA.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Any curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	For example, the FCC is currently considering a proposal by a private party, LightSquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If the FCC were to permit implementation of LightSquared s proposal as is, terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P85_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	There are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	For example, in June 2009 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act that would phase-in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	The U.S. Senate is considering one or more different bills, and it is uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P88_S4	These actions could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for components used in the manufacture of our products and freight costs.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P91_S1	During 2010, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $26.55 to a high of $39.94.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P91_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As of January 14, 2011, members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 44.80% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P95_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	On June 27, 2010 we completed the redomestication of the place of our incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the Redomestication ).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	As a result of increased shareholder approval requirements under Swiss law, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a Cayman Islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by a shareholders meeting every two years.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Swiss law does not provide as much flexibility as Cayman Islands law in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares either.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P98_S1	For example, while the board of directors of a Cayman Islands company can authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval, we will not be able to issue preferred stock without the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes represented and a majority of the par value of the shares represented at a general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our board of directors previously had authority under Cayman Islands law.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P98_S3	For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The par value of our shares is higher following the Redomestication.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	As a result, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a Cayman Islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The par value of our shares is 10 Swiss francs per share, compared to a par value of $0.005 per share when we were a Cayman Islands company.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Under Swiss law, we may not issue shares below par value.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P100_S2	In the event we need to raise equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares, we will be unable to issue shares.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P100_S3	In addition, we will not be able to issue options under our benefits plans with an exercise price below the par value, which would limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We are subject to various Swiss taxes following the Redomestication.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Although we do not expect Swiss taxes to materially affect our worldwide effective corporate tax rate, we are subject to additional corporate taxes in Switzerland following the Redomestication.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Switzerland imposes a corporate federal income tax for holding companies at an effective tax rate of 7.83%, although we should be entitled to a participation relief that in most cases will effectively eliminate any Swiss taxation on the profits of our subsidiaries paid by them to us as dividends as well as on capital gains related to the sale of participations.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P102_S2	We also are subject to a Swiss issuance stamp tax levied on our share issuances, other than in connection with qualifying restructurings, or increases of our equity at a rate of 1% of the fair market value of the issuance or increase.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P102_S3	In addition, we are subject to some other Swiss indirect taxes (e.g., VAT, Swiss issuance stamp tax on certain debt instruments and Swiss securities transfer stamp tax).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P104_S2	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P105_S2	In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P105_S3	If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Under Swiss tax law applicable until December 31, 2010, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction have been treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P106_S1	On January 1, 2011, under Swiss laws the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the Swiss Stock Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_11_ITEM1A_P107_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are the principal properties owned or leased by the Company and its subsidiaries:
1121788_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. occupy a facility of approximately 1,120,000 square feet on 42 acres in Olathe, Kansas, where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured and products are warehoused, distributed, and supported for North, Central and South America.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Garmin s subsidiary, Garmin Realty, LLC also owns an additional 46 acres of land on the Olathe site for future expansion.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	In connection with the bond financings for the facility in Olathe and the previous expansion of that facility, the City of Olathe holds the legal title to the Olathe facility which is leased to Garmin s subsidiaries by the City.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the payment in full of the outstanding bonds, the City of Olathe is obligated to transfer title to Garmin s subsidiaries for the aggregate sum of $200.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	Garmin International, Inc. has purchased all the outstanding bonds and continues to hold the bonds until maturity in order to benefit from property tax abatement.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Garmin Corporation owns and occupies a 249,326 square foot facility in Sijhih, Taipei County, Taiwan, a 223,469 square foot facility in Jhongli, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan, and an approximately 580,000 square foot facility in LinKou, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	In these three facilities Garmin Corporation manufactures all of Garmin s consumer and portable aviation products and warehouses, markets and supports products for the Pacific Rim countries.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	Garmin AT, Inc. leases approximately 15 acres of land in Salem, Oregon under a ground lease.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	This ground lease expires in 2030 but Garmin AT has the option to extend the ground lease until 2050.
1121788_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	Garmin AT, Inc. owns and occupies a 115,000 square foot facility for office, development and manufacturing use and a 33,000 square foot aircraft hangar, flight test and certification facility on this land.

1121788_11_ITEM2_P8_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd. owns and occupies a 155,000 square foot building located in Totton, Southampton, England, used as offices and a distribution facility.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	TomTom N.V., TomTom International B.V., and TomTom, Inc.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	On August 14, 2009, Ambato Media, LLC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Garmin Ltd. and Garmin International, Inc. along with several codefendants alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,432,542 ( the 542 patent ).
1121788_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	On September 28, 2009, Garmin filed its Answer and Counterclaims asserting the 542 patent is invalid and not infringed.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	No. 508 681 ( the 681 Patent ).
1121788_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	Garmin has filed separate lawsuits in the German Federal Patent Court in Munich seeking declaratory judgments of invalidity of the 892 Patent and the 681 Patent.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	On January 11, 2011, the District Court in D sseldorf issued decisions finding infringement of the 892 and 681 Patents.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	Garmin intends to appeal these decisions.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In the Matter of Certain Multimedia Display and Navigation Devices and Systems, Components Thereof, and Products Containing the Same.
1121788_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	No. 6,122,592 ( the 592 patent ), and U.S. Patent No. 5,424,951 ( the 951 patent ).
1121788_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	On January 12, 2010, Garmin filed its Answer asserting the 448 patent, the 592 patent, and the 951 patent are invalid and not infringed.

1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in four business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor/fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our portable GPS receivers and accessories for marine, recreation/fitness and automotive/mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P4_S6	Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% since 2006 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 3% since 2006.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	The vast majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of Dynastream Innovations Inc. in 2006, Digital Cyclone, Inc. and the assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc. in 2007, eleven European distributors between 2007 and 2010, and MetriGear, Inc. in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	These acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Since our principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The table below provides a listing of our functional currency by subsidiary excluding the European subsidiaries that utilize the Euro.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Approximately 77% of sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We experienced ($88.4) million, ($6.0) million, and ($35.3) million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The 2008 foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of the Euro between the date we purchased shares in Tele Atlas N.V. in October 2007 and the tender of shares in February, March, and June 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMU) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime which was introduced in January 2009, this enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including LMU.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the LMU.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined primarily using VSOE.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	Amounts allocated to the LMU are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including premium traffic.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the premium traffic service.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Amounts allocated to the premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	service, which provides direct links to certain online information.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the n vi 1690.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the n Link service.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P18_S4	Amounts allocated to the n Link services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month life of the service.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Garmin records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We sell our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	We determine these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Garmin s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Investment income is recorded when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Fair value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	If investments are determined to be impaired, a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	It is Garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin s compensation package for employees.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Employees with certain levels of responsibility within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion above.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	In 2010, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	In addition, the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix shifted toward products bundled with lifetime maps.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	See Note 2 for further information.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	This was partially offset by a positive refinement in the warranty reserve.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	In 2009, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S6	In 2008, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lower-margin product groups.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S7	These impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines, most significantly flash memory.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S8	Gross margins for the aviation, marine, and outdoor/fitness segments are more stable.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P36_S9	Our long-term gross margin targets are 65%, 55% and 55%, respectively, for these segments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	We believe that because of our practice of performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house, our Sijhih, Jhongli, and Lin-Kou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor/fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	As revenues grew in 2008, advertising expense also increased.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	In 2009-2010, we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	The reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	We expect advertising costs to decrease in 2011 as revenues decline.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 due to legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Due to the economic pressure on our consumer-oriented business, we decreased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	As revenues grew in 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses increased.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to be stable or decline slightly in 2011 as revenues decline.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Approximately 87% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The remainder of our research and development activities is performed primarily by our Taiwan engineering group.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	We expect our research and development budget in absolute terms to be stable in 2011.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our top ten customers have contributed between 34% and 36% of net sales since 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 70 and 78 days since 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix, longer payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	We expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately (1.3%) during 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	The negative rate was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	The one-time items of ($98.7) million include the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S5	Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 12.9% for 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S6	This increase resulted from an unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S7	We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S8	Management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2011, there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S9	Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be higher than fiscal 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P45_S10	The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2011, and the composition of our earnings.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown:
1121788_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our four segments during the period shown.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Net sales decreased 9% in 2010 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by revenue growth in outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	The outdoor/fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 19%.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 70% in 2009 to 62% in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Total unit sales decreased 4% to 16.0 million units in 2010 from 16.6 million units in 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2010 was attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units due to increased saturation in the segment and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation segments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 19% in 2010, as the average selling price and volumes declined 11% and 9%, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Outdoor/fitness segment revenue increased 19% on the strength of recent product introductions that expand the addressable market and ongoing global penetration.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	Marine revenues increased 12% due to product introductions, slight industry recovery and market share gains.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Aviation revenues increased 7% as the Company delivered into additional cockpits and the retrofit business began to recover.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company anticipates ongoing revenue declines in 2011 driven by the automotive/mobile segment with partially offsetting growth in the outdoor/fitness, aviation and marine segments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 11% in 2010 when compared to the year-ago period which was generally consistent with the change in revenue.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The absolute dollar decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by cost of goods increases in outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	This adjustment impacted all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor/fitness and marine having the largest benefits.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	Cost per unit declined in all segments driving stable to improving margins in outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be stable in 2011 given current component pricing.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2010 decreased 7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 110 basis points compared to 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Gross profit margins were stable to increasing in all segments excluding the automotive/mobile segment when compared to 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decrease of 160 basis points was driven by an 11% decrease in average selling price which was only partially offset by a decline in per unit costs including the warranty benefit.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Gross profit dollars of the automotive/mobile segment declined to 50% of total gross profit dollars from 60% in 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Gross profit dollars for marine increased 18% compared to 2009 due to product mix shifting toward higher margin units.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	Gross profit dollars for outdoor/fitness increased by 19% to $364.5 million due to strong revenue growth in the segment.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will be stable in 2011 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles offsetting continued margin pressure in the automotive/mobile segment due to price declines.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Advertising expense decreased 7% in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	As a percent of revenues, advertising expenses were 5% in both 2010 and 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The absolute dollar decrease occurred primarily in the automotive/mobile segment due to reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners partially offset by mobile handset specific advertising.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Further offsetting the decline was increased advertising for outdoor/fitness where we continue to invest for growth.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2011.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 9% of revenues in 2009 to 11% of revenues in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	Aviation costs declined year-over-year due to a 2009 bad debt accrual driven by cash collection risks associated with several of our customers that did not reoccur in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to decline in absolute dollars but to increase as a percentage of sales in 2011 as revenue declines outpace cost reductions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Research and development expense increased 16% due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative which has now been cancelled, and the addition of over 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $38.9 million primarily in the auto/mobile segment, when compared with the year-ago period and increased 220 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will be stable during fiscal 2011 on an absolute dollar basis in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating income decreased 300 basis points as a percent of revenue and 19% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The automotive/mobile operating margin declined from 22% in 2009 to 15% in 2010 due to a 160 basis point decline in gross margins and selling, general and administrative and research and development expense increases during a period of declining revenues.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal 2010 relative to fiscal 2009, with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	Interest income for fiscal 2010 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year partially offset by decreasing interest rates.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Due to the relative size of entities using other currencies, movements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Euro is the functional currency of all subsidiaries excluding those shown below.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	As subsidiaries have grown, currency moves generated material gains and losses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The $88.4 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	During 2010, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The $6.0 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of $5.8 million.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $4.3 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our earnings before taxes fell 29% when compared to 2009 and our income tax expense decreased by $112.0 million, to ($7.3) million, for fiscal year 2010 from $104.7 million for fiscal year 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The significant decline in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 12.9% for 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate as compared to 2009 is largely due to an unfavorable mix of income among taxing jurisdictions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 17% to $584.6 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to $704.0 million for fiscal year 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net sales decreased 16% in 2009 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	The decrease occurred across all segments, except outdoor/fitness, with the greatest decreases in the automotive/mobile and aviation segments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Automotive/mobile revenue was the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 73% in 2008 to 70% in 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Total unit sales decreased 2% to 16.6 million in 2009 from 16.9 million in 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all segments, excluding outdoor/fitness, with the greatest percentage declines occurring in aviation and marine.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	The lower volumes were driven primarily by the macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail partners.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 19% in 2009 as the average selling price declined 18% and volumes declined 2%.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	Average selling price declines continue to be attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotive/mobile products compete.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The aviation and marine segments declined 24% and 13%, respectively in 2009, as both industries experienced significant slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	Outdoor/fitness segment revenue increased 10% due to new product introductions, including the Dakota series, the Forerunner 405CX, the Forerunner 310XT and Edge 500, and increasing global penetration of the fitness category.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	All segments showed improving trends in the second half of 2009 as the macroeconomic conditions improved.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 23% in 2009 when compared to 2008 due primarily to the 16% decline in revenue.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	In addition, cost per unit declined in all segments driving cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue lower due to material cost reductions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	This savings was partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiatives.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the automotive/mobile and aviation segments where the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross margins earned.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	Gross profit margin percentage for the Company overall increased 450 basis points as margins expanded in all segments.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of 350 basis points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price declines.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Outdoor/fitness gross margin increased principally due to a newer suite of higher margin products.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	Gross profit margin percentage for marine and aviation increased compared to 2008 due to increased average selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material cost reductions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Advertising expense decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	As a percent of sales, advertising expenses declined to 5% in 2009 compared to 6.0% in 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	The decrease was a result of actions taken by the company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising which is tied to net sales levels.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 5% in 2009 while it increased as a percentage of sales compared to 2008 as costs throughout the Company were reduced but not as rapidly as the revenue declines.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The decline in costs was primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in 2008 as a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support and information technology.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	The increased expense for the outdoor/fitness segment and the decreased expense for the automotive/mobile segment were driven by the allocation of costs based on revenues.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	As outdoor/fitness revenues have increased as a percentage of revenues, additional selling, general and administrative expenses are shifted to the segment.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P84_S4	As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 8% in 2008 to 9% of sales in 2009, as revenues declined.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative, the addition of 230 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period, and an increase in engineering program costs in 2009 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Operating income increased 200 basis points as a percent of revenue but decreased 9% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased research and development expenses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008, with the majority of this difference caused by a large gain on sale of equity securities in 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	Interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The $6.0 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of $5.8 million.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	The relative weakness of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The remaining net currency gain of $4.3 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The $35.3 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our Tele Atlas N.V. shares.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	During 2008, the Taiwan Dollar weakened 1.6% in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $20.8 million gain.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The Euro weakened 4.1% and the British Pound Sterling weakened 26.1% relative to the U.S. Dollar in 2008 which resulted in a $77.3 million loss.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of the Euro between the date of purchase of the Tele Atlas N.V. shares in October 2007 to the dates of tender in February, March, and June 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	Other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of $0.3 million.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Gain on sale of equity of securities of $50.9 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in Tele Atlas N.V. which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares, which was subsequently abandoned.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our fiscal 2009 earnings before taxes fell 12% when compared to 2008, while our income tax expense decreased 42%.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	Income taxes fell $76.8 million, to $104.7 million, for fiscal year 2009 from $181.5 million for fiscal year 2008, due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	The effective tax rate was 12.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 19.9% for fiscal 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	The decrease in tax rate is due to the favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 4% to $704.0 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $732.8 million for fiscal year 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Net cash generated by operations was $770.6 million, $1,094.5 million, and $862.2 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Primary drivers of the cash generation in 2010 included $584.6 million of net income with non-cash adjustments for depreciation/amortization of $94.7 million, foreign currency unrealized losses of $62.8 million, stock compensation expense of $40.3 million, $129.7 million related to decreased accounts receivable as sales levels have declined and $131.3 million of sales for which cash was received but revenue was deferred as required by our revenue recognition policies.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	This cash generation was partially offset by uses of cash including a $144.5 million reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities related primarily to the timing of royalty payments and the $146.4 million reversal of tax reserves associated with both release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US and expiration of statute of limitations, a $81.4 million reduction in accounts payable primarily in our Taiwan manufacturing operations due to timing of payments, and a $77.1 million increase in inventories following a low inventory level exiting 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	The decline in cash flow from operations over 2009 levels was due to reduced net income levels and the effect of the non cash income tax benefit realized from reduced tax reserves.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	We expect to generate cash flow from operations in 2011 with ongoing net income, as well as working capital gains through reduced accounts receivable and inventory levels as sales decline.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	Cash flow used in investing activities was $72.9 million, $547.9 million and $56.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to the net redemption of or investment in fixed income securities, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Capital expenditures in 2010 totaled $32.2 million and related to business operations and maintenance activities.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	This has declined significantly from 2008 spending levels due to the completion of production and warehouse facility expansions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S4	We have budgeted approximately $50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S5	In 2010 and 2009, net investment in fixed income securities of our on-hand cash was $25.5 million and $491.0 million, respectively, as we invested excess cash.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S6	In 2008, the net sale of fixed income securities was primarily related to $239.3 million of cash generated from the tender of our shares of Tele Atlas N.V.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S7	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S8	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S9	Garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 1.3%, 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P96_S10	In 2010, cash flow used in investing activities also included the acquisition of MetriGear, Inc.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	In 2008, cash flow used in investing for acquisitions related to the purchase of European distributors.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 was $510.8 million resulting from the use of $298.9 million for payment of our declared dividend and $225.9 million for stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan, partially offset by $14.0 million from the issuance of common stock related to our Company stock option plan and stock based compensation tax benefits.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The 2010 dividend paid was significantly higher than prior years as the dividend was increased to $1.50 per share.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Stock repurchases are made at the discretion of management under repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors as business and market conditions warrant.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased 7.4 million shares, 0.7 million shares and 17.1 million shares, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, to pay dividends and to repurchase shares.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, repurchase of shares, payment of dividends declared, and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2011.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 25, 2010, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Operating leases describes lease obligations associated with Garmin facilities located in the U.S., Taiwan, Europe, and Canada.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $153.6 million as of December 25, 2010, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P104_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes , to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	All European subsidiaries excluding Garmin (Europe) Ltd., Garmin Danmark, Garmin Sweden, Garmin Polska and Garmin Norge use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In 2010, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% relative to the Euro and 3.3% relative to the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of $51.0 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $1.3 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $88.4 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $61.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 25, 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses.
1121788_11_ITEM7A_P10_S3	At December 25, 2010, cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were $4.6 million.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related products.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC), wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd., is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to Garmin International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC, and Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	GII is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in many international markets and in the United States as well as research and new product development.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures certain products for the Company s aviation segment.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	GEL is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products, principally within the European market.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 included 52 weeks.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P10_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P10_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of $61,740 and $9,231 as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange gains/(losses) of ($88,377), ($6,040), and ($35,286) for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S3	The loss in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S4	The loss in fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar offset by the weakening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P11_S5	The loss in fiscal 2008 was the result of the strengthening of the USD offset by a gain associated with the sale and tender of our Tele Atlas N.V. shares.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P14_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cost is determined using the weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and GEL.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009, or 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	On March 16, 2010 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on April 30, 2010 to shareholders of record on April 15, 2010.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $136,548 at December 25, 2010 and $129,066 at December 26, 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Accumulated amortization was $103,534 and $80,428 at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	Amortization expense was $36,675, $37,444, and $30,874, for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P28_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $24,889, $10,584, $4,612, $2,482, and $2,317, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at December 25, 2010.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of ($5,736) and ($22,613), respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss), net of related taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes .
1121788_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Income taxes of $233,028 and $171,097 at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2010 was $153,621 including interest of $9,580.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for years ending December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 is as follows:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	The December 25, 2010 balance of $153,621 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	The entire $153,621 and $255,748 are required to be classified as non-current at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Interest expense and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, the Company had accrued approximately $9,580 and $20,160 respectively for interest.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	Interest expense included in income tax expense for the years ending December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 are ($10,580) and $9,000, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2007.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company also considers 2007 and 2008 US federal returns to have been effectively settled due to completion of an audit examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	A reduction of income tax expense of ($122,314) was recognized to reflect this settlement.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	In addition, the Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $24,066 and $19,771 in fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $14,069 million of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statute of limitations.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P45_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	For multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	In such circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMU) bundled in the original purchase price.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P64_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Our capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company currently sponsors three stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, "Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements" ("ASU 2010-06"), which is included in the ASC Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	ASU 2010-06 also requires disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the Level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P69_S3	Except as otherwise provided, ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09, "Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements" ("ASU 2010-09"), which is included in ASC Topic 855 (Subsequent Events).

1121788_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	ASU 2010-09 was effective upon the issuance of the final update and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	For fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, an independent third party provided the valuation.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	The inputs used in the valuations used the following methodology.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	The collateral composition was used to estimate Weighted Average Life based on historical and projected payment information.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Cash flows were projected for the issuing trusts, taking into account underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding, and payout formulas.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	Taking this information into account, assumptions were made as to the yields likely to be required, based upon then current market conditions for comparable or similar term Asset Based Securities as well as other fixed income securities.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	All Level 3 investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	However, it is the Company s intent to hold these securities until they recover their value.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the period, the accounting guidance requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately for each major category of assets.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The following is a summary of the company s marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities at December 25, 2010:

1121788_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in 2009 and 2010 were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P83_S3	Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	During 2009 and 2010, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 25, 2010, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $11,768, $10,293, and $8,419 for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $413,550, $678,868, and $823,364, for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2015, at which time these tax benefits might expire.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 25, 2010 is 5.55 and 5.14 years, respectively.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 25, 2010 was 2.39 years.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2010, 2009, and 2008:
1121788_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	Because the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P122_S4	The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs released during the year ended December 25, 2010 was $8,828.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P122_S5	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period, which was $30.36 on December 25, 2010, and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P124_S3	The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1121788_11_ITEM8_P124_S4	During 2010, 2009, and 2008, 349,173, 209,416, and 362,902 shares, respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $8,134, $3,874, and $8,782, respectively.

1121788_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	The redomestication effectively changed the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of Garmin from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	See Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of exhibits.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	To create leading-edge navigation and communication devices that can enrich our customers' lives through the worldwide collaborative efforts of our colleagues.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	We surround ourselves with creative minds and passionate spirits.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	We continually invest in innovation through the worldwide collaborative efforts of our colleagues.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	Innovation drives our success now and in the future.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	We commit to high performance and take personal ownership for the success of our company.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	We work together to continually adapt and improve our products.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	We are dedicated to serving our customers and design our products with the customer in mind.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	Our associates are in the air, on the water, in the woods, behind the wheel, and on the run designing solutions for our customers.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	We strive to conduct all of our business dealings with uncompromising integrity and professionalism.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	We make and keep our commitments, admit our mistakes, and learn from our experiences.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	We work as a team with respect and trust for each other.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	We openly and freely share ideas and look for opportunities to help all team members grow.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	We strive to extend our team spirit to our communities worldwide.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Garmin was built on the cornerstones of innovation, integrity, and professionalism.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Our future success requires each of our associates to understand and demonstrate these core values:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	One of my colleagues is continually late for meetings, both internal and external.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	No, it is not professional or respectful to be habitually late for meetings.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	It may reflect poorly on Garmin s reputation in external meetings and may give the impression internally that the associate is untrustworthy and not respectful of others.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	I received the final version of a contract with a Garmin supplier and noticed a mistake.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	The error is favorable to Garmin, but not consistent with our oral agreement.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	In many cases, more than one Garmin associate is involved in contract negotiations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	First, talk with other members of the Garmin negotiating team to confirm that your understanding of the oral agreement is correct.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	If so, call the mistake to the attention of the Garmin supplier and ask that the contract be changed to reflect the actual agreement of the parties.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	We must treat others in a fair and professional manner to maintain their confidence and trust in Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Since Garmin was founded in 1989, we have worked hard to uphold the highest ethical standards when conducting Garmin-related business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	You will be asked to acknowledge your awareness that every Garmin associate must follow this Code and to affirm your willingness to follow this Code.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	The first element of this Code is to conduct business in an honest, fair, and trustworthy manner.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	As a Garmin associate, you must:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Garmin s success depends on our ability to maintain the confidence, respect, and trust of Garmin's customers, suppliers, partners, shareholders, and others.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	We are committed to acting professionally with integrity, being responsive and accountable, investing in new product development, and remaining a leader in our field.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	To attract and retain customers, Garmin associates must understand and try to anticipate their needs.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	We satisfy customer needs, such as providing quality and reliable products and superior service, in a legal and ethical manner:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	We deal with all suppliers and business partners professionally, ethically, and fairly.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	We strive to avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety by conducting Garmin business in good faith and resolving disputes quickly and equitably, when possible.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	In our purchasing decisions, negotiations, contract development, and contract administration, we comply with applicable laws and regulations and we expect our business partners to do likewise.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Garmin s suppliers and business partners also must adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior and regulatory compliance.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	We expect our suppliers to provide high-quality services and products, maintain flexibility and cost-effectiveness, and to act with the best interests of Garmin in mind.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	We do not accept kickbacks, bribes, or other incentives in return for conducting business with our suppliers.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Gift-giving practices vary around the world.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	Gifts are typically given to create goodwill.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	In some parts of the world, declining a gift may insult the giver.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	On the other hand, accepting a gift may create a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	To avoid conflicts of interest, we do not (1) solicit gifts from any customer, supplier, business partner, or other person doing business with Garmin, (2) accept high-value gifts unless and until you have consulted with Garmin s Chief Operating Officer and Legal Department and they have reviewed the situation and determined that the gift is appropriate, or (3) give or accept under any circumstances payments, loans, kickbacks, special privileges, or services to current or potential customers, suppliers, or strategic partners.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	If we believe we must decline a gift or favor, we politely explain that Garmin policy prohibits us from accepting it.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	We keep in mind that in parts of the world where gift-giving is common practice and not accepting a gift could reflect badly on Garmin, it may be appropriate to accept the gift so long as doing so would not violate any laws and would not influence our judgment or in any way discredit Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Except when working with government employees, we may accept reasonable meals or other reasonably priced forms of entertainment from third parties as a courtesy extended during the normal course of business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	Associates who work with government employees are responsible for knowing and following the local rules and regulations regarding government employee buyer-and seller relationships.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	After working on a long and difficult project for a Garmin customer, the customer offered me a very expensive gold watch to thank me for my assistance.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Garmin associates must consider the value of a gift when deciding whether to accept it.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	An expensive gold watch typically costs thousands of dollars and would create the appearance of impropriety, as well as possibly impact the associate s judgment in the performance of his or her Garmin duties.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	A bicycle racing team that Garmin sponsors just sent me a high-end bicycle to thank me for putting in significant amounts of extra time and hard work on marketing for the race.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	A high-end bicycle typically costs one thousand dollars or more.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	Accepting such a gift would create the appearance of impropriety and possibly impact your judgment in the performance of your Garmin duties.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	You should return the bicycle to the donor with a polite explanation that Garmin policy prohibits you from accepting the gift.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Garmin s business decisions are shaped by its financial and business records.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	We must maintain accurate and complete company records.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Transactions between Garmin and outside individuals and organizations must be promptly and accurately entered in our books in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and principles.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P50_S3	If you have questions about a record or you become aware of records that may be inaccurate or incomplete, you should report the situation immediately to your supervisor.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P50_S4	Garmin does not support or tolerate misrepresenting facts or falsifying records under any circumstances.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Garmin s independent and internal auditors help ensure that the ways in which we conduct business and keep records are consistent with relevant accounting standards.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	All Garmin associates must cooperate with the company s auditors.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	As a public company we apply standards of full, fair, accurate, understandable, and timely disclosure in reports filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and in all other public communications.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	We establish and maintain clear, open, and honest communications, building our relationships on trust, respect, and mutual understanding.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	We are accountable and responsive to our customers, colleagues, and business partners.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P52_S3	Our advertising, sale, and marketing materials are truthful, accurate, and free from false claims.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	An outside service provider offered me tickets to the Super Bowl game.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	Garmin has serious concerns about high-value gifts because they may be viewed by others as an attempt to influence your business decisions.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	Before accepting any high-value gift, you must consult with Garmin s Chief Operating Officer and Legal Department so they can review the situation and determine whether the activity is appropriate.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	After working on a long and difficult project for a Garmin customer, the customer offered me an expensive gold watch to thank me for my assistance.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Garmin associates may not accept a gift offered in connection with their job if doing so may impact their judgment in the performance of their Garmin duties or create the appearance of impropriety.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	Associates must consider the value of a gift when deciding whether to accept it.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	At Garmin, we must keep up with developments in our industry, including obtaining information about our competitors and their products.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	We obtain this information only through honest, ethical, and legal methods.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	We are a global company and must comply with the laws of many countries.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	Each of us is responsible for knowing and following all applicable laws and regulations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	We are also responsible for preventing, detecting, and reporting violations of laws and regulations to Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	We must comply not only with the letter of the law, but also with the spirit.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	If this Code or Garmin Guidelines differ from local laws and regulations, we always follow the higher standard.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	If you believe any part of this Code conflicts with local law, you should consult Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P59_S3	Typical legal matters relating to Garmin business include:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Because Garmin is a global business, we are subject to laws and regulations designed to promote fair competition and encourage ethical and legal behavior among competitors.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	Antitrust laws and fair competition laws generally prohibit any activity that restrains free trade and limits competition.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	We conduct Garmin business in accordance with these laws.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	Violating antitrust laws could result in substantial criminal penalties for both Garmin and the individual involved.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	In all countries where Garmin conducts business, we are committed to competing vigorously but fairly for suppliers and customers.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	To avoid possible antitrust violations, we must not:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Require inappropriate conditions on purchases or sales of Garmin products.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	If you have questions about fair competition or antitrust matters, contact Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	One of our dealers in France wants to talk with other dealers about unit prices and has asked for my help.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	No. Discussions among dealers could lead to charges of price fixing, which is a violation of competitive laws.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	Always seek legal advice from Garmin's Legal Department regarding any situations about product pricing or other potentially anti-competitive matters.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	A customer has asked me to certify that one of our Garmin products was not manufactured in Israel.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	Providing this type of certification would violate the U.S. anti-boycott regulations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	You should not respond to any boycott-related requests without first contacting the Garmin Legal Department for guidance.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	I am a Garmin associate but do not work in the United States.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	In my country, it is customary to pay government officials to obtain business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	Even though it is an accepted way of doing business in your country, payments to government officials may well violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	You should consult Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Garmin complies with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does business, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
1121788_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	These bribery and anti-corruption laws are intended to prevent companies and individuals from gaining an unfair advantage through bribes, kickbacks and other corrupt activities.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	We must never offer or accept bribes, kickbacks or other illegal payments.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P70_S3	We will not participate in or facilitate any type of corrupt activities.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	When choosing contractors, consultants or other business partners, we must never engage a third party who or which may attempt to offer a bribe or kickback to conduct Garmin business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	Neither Garmin nor any of its agents, partners, or representatives will make any improper direct or indirect payments or promises of payment to foreign government officials.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	When working with governments, consult with Garmin s Legal Department to be certain you understand any special rules that may apply.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Garmin is a global business, with relationships in most of the world s countries.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The laws governing imports and exports differ in every country.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	These laws and regulations cover more than just physical shipments.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	They also apply to electronic transfers of technical data, software and technology, as well as the provision of services over the Internet.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P72_S4	In some cases, Garmin may need to obtain an export license or other governmental approval before it may ship or transfer an item.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Garmin must comply with import and export regulations and requirements when engaging in international trade.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	We must be aware of import and export regulations and requirements, especially if we are involved in those aspects of Garmin s business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	In addition to obvious importing examples such as importing parts or products into the United States or another country, some importing situations are very subtle.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	For example, the shipment of marketing samples or the calculation of product intercompany prices for sales of Garmin products in another country may have import implications.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	A failure to comply with the law - even an inadvertent failure - can result in significant fines, penalties, imprisonment, and/or a loss of import or export privileges, as well as customs scrutiny and delays.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	If Company A is publicly traded and Garmin s proposed acquisition has not been announced, if your sister buys or sells Company A stock based on your tip, you both could be charged with insider trading.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	A dealer asked me to ship Garmin products to another country.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	I have not shipped Garmin products to that country before.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	It is important for Garmin associates involved in international trade to be aware of applicable laws and regulations for different countries.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	In many cases, the law requires an export license or other governmental approvals before an item may be shipped or transferred.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	Violations, even inadvertent ones, could result in significant fines and penalties, denied export licenses, loss of export privileges or customs delays.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P78_S3	You should seek advice from Garmin's Legal Department before making the shipment.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	When doing business for Garmin or in discussions with Garmin s customers, vendors, or business partners, we may become aware of material non-public information about Garmin or the other organization.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	Many countries have insider trading laws that prohibit or restrict securities trading and other activities by a person who has material, non-public information.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	Information is deemed material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold the company s securities.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	If we have material, non-public information about Garmin or another company, we must not:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	Share the information with others who may buy or sell securities because of the material, non-public information (also known as tipping ).
1121788_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Because of the severe penalties associated with insider trading and tipping, contact Garmin s Legal Department before buying or selling public securities in these situations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	Garmin also has guidelines and policies to help us comply with securities law requirements.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	Garmin s securities are publicly traded.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	As a result, Garmin must comply with various securities laws governing public disclosure of information to investors and the public.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	These laws are designed to promote transparency in the U.S. financial markets.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	If you are responsible for preparing the reports that Garmin submits to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or contributing information for such reports, you must ensure that the company s disclosures are accurate, complete and fair.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	Because of these disclosure requirements, only a small number of associates authorized by Garmin may make public statements on behalf of Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	If a reporter or other third party calls you regarding Garmin business, refer the caller to Garmin s Investor Relations Manager or Chief Financial Officer.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	We are using a low-cost supplier for Garmin parts.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	The supplier offers good quality, reliable delivery and great prices, but I am uncomfortable with the working and living conditions it provides to its workers.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	Immediately report the matter to your manager for investigation.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	Garmin s reputation depends on doing business with suppliers and other business partners who treat their workers fairly and responsibly.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	I am disabled and have been asked to attend an offsite team-building meeting at a site that is not wheel-chair accessible.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	but I don t want to be viewed as a non-team player or lose my job.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	Racial and sexual comments of any kind are unprofessional and likely to offend others.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P106_S1	Garmin does not tolerate comments by its associates, customers, or suppliers that are racial or sexual in nature or which are offensive, vulgar, or belittling of others.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P106_S2	That is not our culture and is unacceptable.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P106_S3	Associates who encounter such situations should contact senior management or file an anonymous report using the procedures in the Code of Conduct.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P106_S4	All good faith reports are investigated immediately.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	My spouse owns a small printing company and has asked me whether he can market its services to Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	So long as neither you nor your spouse uses your Garmin relationship to influence in any way the outcome of the marketing activity, this is acceptable.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	However, you must first disclose to Garmin management that the proposed printing supplier is owned by your spouse and you cannot be involved in or influence Garmin s selection of a printing company.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	My son recently graduated from college and will have to move back home if he does not find employment soon.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	Your child is free to apply for a job at Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	You may not, however, use your position to influence the hiring process in any way.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	If your child is hired by Garmin, he may not report to you.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	At Garmin, I am a software engineer developing software for our automotive products.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	Generally, you are prohibited from engaging in any outside employment that is substantially similar to your job at Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	My spouse works for a large company that makes GPS devices and competes with Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	It may be, depending on your spouse s position.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	You should disclose this relationship to your manager.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P114_S2	You also should be especially careful to protect Garmin s proprietary and confidential information.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	I own stock in a Garmin competitor.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	Not necessarily it depends on the amount of stock that you own.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	A small financial interest in a competing public company does not necessarily result in a conflict of interest.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	Owning shares of a mutual fund that invests in a competitor s securities is also not considered a conflict of interest.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	One of Garmin s outside service providers invited my spouse and me to dinner and a concert.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	You must use discretion and good judgment when accepting gifts or entertainment in business settings.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	You may keep frequent flyer credits and use them for personal travel.

1121788_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	My spouse, who is not a Garmin associate, would like to accompany me.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	The supplier that I am visiting has offered to pay my spouse s travel expenses.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	You are responsible for expenses generated by having your spouse travel with you.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	In most circumstances, Garmin associates may give inexpensive promotional items or gifts.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	Garmin associates may not, however, give gifts to any distributor or supplier that may influence, or create the appearance of an attempt to influence, the judgment of the supplier or distributor in its business dealings with Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	As a government contractor providing its commercial products and services to Federal agencies, Garmin is subject to certain heightened ethics requirements.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	The Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR ) rules on mandatory disclosure, and ethics and compliance require Garmin in certain circumstances, to disclose evidence of violations of criminal laws by a principal, associate, agent, or sub-contractor and to implement certain internal controls within the Company.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	These Government Contractor Compliance rules require, for contracts and solicitations after Dec. 12, 2008, the insertion of the clause at FAR 52.203-13, Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, in all contracts in which the value of the contract is expected to exceed $5 million and the performance period is 120 days or more (a "covered contract").
1121788_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	Garmin, through its Legal Department, is required to make timely disclosures to the agency Office of the Inspector General and/or the Federal government contracting officer or other prescribed Federal official when the Company has credible evidence that a principal, associate, agent or sub-contractor, in connection with the award, performance, or close-out of a Federal government contract or sub-contract: (i) has committed a violation of federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations in Title 18 of the U.S. Code; (ii) has committed a violation of the civil False Claims Act; or (iii) the Company has received a significant overpayment by the government in connection with a Federal government contract.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P126_S1	The rule also creates a basis for suspension and debarment from contracting if Garmin fails to timely disclose credible evidence of violations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	Garmin is required to, and does, have in place a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this document) and certain internal controls.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	This Code of Business Conduct and the internal controls are intended to be reasonable and effective efforts to, among other things, prevent the hiring or promotion as a principal any person whom due diligence would have exposed as having engaged in conduct that conflicts with Garmin's code of business ethics and conduct; prevent the Company from doing business with sub-contractors with poor records of business integrity and ethics; and promote training for sub-contractors and agents as appropriate.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	It is important for all associates to be aware of, and to comply with, these requirements.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	Managers and associates should direct questions and report violations to the Legal Department or the anonymous hotline.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Conflicts of interest arise when the personal or family interests of a Garmin associate influence or even appear to influence his or her ability or judgment to act in the best interests of Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	We avoid taking any actions or acquiring interests that may make it difficult to perform our work for Garmin in an objective and effective manner.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	When conducting business with third parties on behalf of Garmin, we act in a fair and objective manner, without favor or preferences based upon personal considerations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	As Garmin associates, we do not engage in activities that compete with Garmin s current or proposed products or services.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	We do not own a significant interest in any business that does or is seeking to do business with Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P131_S2	Other situations that may cause conflicts of interest include, among other things, a close relative who works for a Garmin business partner or competitor or as a consulting or part-time position with such company.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	Conflicts of interest may arise if we accept any personal benefit that is or could be interpreted as being given to us because of our ability to influence a Garmin decision.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	Other examples of improper personal benefits that may lead to conflicts of interest include:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	Accepting or offering any entertainment, gifts, favors, or other payments that could be viewed as a bribe.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	In both the performance of our duties for Garmin and our outside activities, we seek to avoid the appearance of, as well as an actual, conflict of interest.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	If you have a concern about a possible conflict of interest, talk with your immediate supervisor or Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	Any possible conflict of interest must be discussed a failure to disclose a possible conflict is a violation of Garmin policy.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P134_S3	Please refer to the Conduct Discipline Policies Protection of Garmin Property section of FRM-435 (Associate Handbook) for more details.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	You should assume the information is confidential and proprietary.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	You may then contact your manager or Garmin s Legal Department to help you determine whether the information is confidential and proprietary.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	I discovered a misuse and possible infringement of Garmin s trademark on the Internet.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	To protect Garmin s rights, you should promptly report the possible misuse and infringement to Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	A distributor s finance manager asked for information about Garmin s sales and financial control procedures for an analysis her company is preparing.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Requests for Garmin financial records must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P139_S1	The release of unauthorized financial information could lead to violation of securities and antitrust laws.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P139_S2	You should contact Garmin s Legal Department for guidance.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	I am leaving Garmin to start my own business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	You may not use or disclose Garmin proprietary information even after you are no longer employed by Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	We are responsible for developing, using and protecting Garmin s assets, including funds, property (both physical and intellectual) and Garmin s reputation.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	We wisely use and protect Garmin s assets to prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized users.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	We use Garmin s assets, including its buildings, equipment, computer and communication systems, to further develop Garmin s business.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	On an occasional and limited basis, we may use computer, printer, and communications systems for personal business, so long as there is no negative impact on Garmin s business and our co-workers are not distracted.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	At all times, we use good judgment and common sense and conduct ourselves ethically, lawfully and professionally.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	Garmin respects associates privacy, but we should not assume that our desk, work station or use of computer or telephone equipment is private or confidential.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Garmin has the right, subject to local laws, to review any material sent, received, or stored on its electronic information exchange systems.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	In using these company assets and systems, we do not create, access, store, print, solicit, or send any material that is intimidating, harassing, threatening, abusive, sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or inappropriate, nor do we send any false, derogatory, or malicious communications.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	Proprietary information is knowledge that Garmin has determined must not be disclosed to others, except as required by law or permitted by company policy.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	Proprietary information includes all non-public information that might be useful to Garmin s competitors or harmful to the company or its customers, including:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	Garmin s financial outlooks and projections.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	Proprietary information is often in digital form, stored on laptop computers, handheld computers, desktops, and portable storage devices.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	We take personal responsibility to safeguard our electronic devices from theft, unauthorized disclosure, or changes.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	To protect Garmin s reputation and its investment in proprietary information, we must understand and comply with Garmin s security policies and procedures.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P149_S2	Disclosure of proprietary information could harm Garmin, from both a competitive and a financial standpoint.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P149_S3	It also could embarrass Garmin associates, customers, suppliers, and business partners.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	When a legitimate business need to disclose Garmin s proprietary information arises, a legally binding non-disclosure agreement may be appropriate.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P150_S1	Consult with Garmin s Legal Department in these situations.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	We are responsible for upholding Garmin s core values reflected in this Code.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	We have a duty to uphold Garmin s reputation and refrain from disclosing sensitive information about Garmin or any of our colleagues, business partners or competitors.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P151_S2	When speaking at a meeting or other public setting or posting information on the Internet, we must clarify that we are expressing our own views and not those of Garmin, unless, of course, we are asked to speak as an authorized representative of Garmin.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	You are expected to become familiar with Garmin s policies regarding records retention and disposal of Garmin documents and to strictly adhere to those procedures as outlined in the policies.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	If a Garmin associate has reason to believe, or Garmin informs an associate, that Garmin records may be relevant to a pending or anticipated litigation matter or government investigation or proceeding, then the Garmin associate must preserve those records until Garmin s Legal Department determines that the records are no longer needed.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	If there is any question as to whether a particular Garmin record should be maintained, a Garmin associate should seek guidance from Garmin s Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	At all times and in all circumstances, all associates are expected to and must pay particular attention to conducting themselves and Garmin s business according to the highest standards of business ethics.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	Associates are expected and required to cooperate with all internal investigations and must not destroy or alter any documents or electronic records, lie to or mislead an investigator, or obstruct the collection of information relating to an investigation or any legal action brought on behalf of, or against, the Company.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	Any questions about whether a document or record may be disposed of, or whether it is required to be preserved, should be brought to the Legal Department before disposing of, destroying, or releasing the document or record.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	It is Garmin's policy to provide full cooperation with government investigators and law enforcement officials.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P157_S1	All inquiries, requests or demands for information from external investigators must be immediately referred to the Legal Department.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P157_S2	The Legal Department will coordinate all responses to external investigators' questions.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P157_S3	Failure to cooperate with legitimate investigations will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	This Code of Conduct applies to all Garmin associates, directors, independent contractors, and agents.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P158_S1	It is our guide and worldwide point of reference for upholding our core values.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P158_S2	Each of us is responsible for understanding this Code of Conduct and complying with it.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	We all have a duty to ensure that Garmin business is conducted with integrity and professionalism.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P159_S1	If we know of, observe, suspect, or otherwise become aware of a violation of Garmin policy or this Code, we immediately must report that concern using one of the three methods described in the following paragraph.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	This Code cannot address every issue or situation we may face as Garmin associates.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	If you are concerned about questionable conduct or wrongdoing at Garmin, you must report the information using one of three options:
1121788_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	Garmin handles all reports seriously and discreetly, carefully investigates the matter and takes appropriate action.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	Federal law provides certain whistleblower protections to all employees of government contractors.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	No associate shall be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as reprisal for disclosing information to the Company, a Member of Congress, or an authorized official of an agency or of the Justice Department, relating to a substantial violation of law under a Federal government contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract).
1121788_11_ITEM15_P162_S2	Any restrictions imposed by an associate agreement or nondisclosure agreement shall not supersede associates whistleblower rights under Federal law.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	Any associate who in good faith reports a possible violation of this Code will not be subject to dismissal or retaliation of any kind.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P163_S1	Garmin will not tolerate reprisals against people who in good faith report concerns or ask questions about possible violations of Garmin policy or this Code of Conduct.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	Garmin will discipline any associate who attempts to retaliate.
1121788_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	Similarly, Garmin will discipline any associates who knowingly make a false report of a possible violation for the purpose of harming another individual.

1121788_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	This discussion of the business of Garmin Ltd. ( Garmin or the Company ) should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Beginning in 2011, for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating segments Auto/Mobile, Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Prior to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of those products, their production processes, the types of customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Management re-evaluated the combination of these operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics of these segments they should now be reported as two distinct reportable segments.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The segment and geographic information included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 8 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Garmin was incorporated in Switzerland on February 9, 2010 as successor to Garmin Ltd., a Cayman Islands company ( Garmin Cayman ).
1121788_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Garmin Cayman was incorporated on July 24, 2000 as a holding company for Garmin Corporation, a Taiwan corporation, in order to facilitate a public offering of Garmin Cayman shares in the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	On June 27, 2010, Garmin became the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group of companies pursuant to a share exchange transaction effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the Redomestication ).
1121788_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	Pursuant to the Redomestication, all issued and outstanding Garmin Cayman common shares were transferred to Garmin and each common share, par value U.S. $0.005 per share, of Garmin Cayman was exchanged for one registered share, par value 10 Swiss francs ( CHF ) per share, of Garmin.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Garmin owns, directly or indirectly, all of the operating companies in the Garmin group.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Garmin s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statement and Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by Garmin s directors and executive officers and all amendments to those reports will be made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of Garmin s website (http://www.garmin.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

1121788_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Garmin is a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communication and information devices and applications, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System ( GPS ) technology.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile, outdoor, fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Prior to May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability ( SA ) for national security purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense discontinued SA.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	With SA removed, a GPS receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a GPS device.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System ( WAAS ) comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States and most of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment.

1121788_12_ITEM1_P167_S7	For Garmin s Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service product line, Garmin believes that its principal competitors are Motorola Solutions, Inc., Cobra Electronics Corporation and Midland Radio Corporation.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S0	Garmin s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin s engineering and manufacturing teams.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S1	Garmin s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 2,558 people worldwide as of December 31, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S2	Garmin s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S3	Garmin s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S4	Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin s success.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P168_S5	Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P169_S0	Below is a table of Garmin s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P170_S0	Garmin believes that one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its Sijhih, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P170_S1	Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than a few select marine products (VHF radios and AIS receivers), and our accessory products, all of which are also manufactured by one or more third parties.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P171_S0	Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P171_S1	In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P172_S0	Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, improved quality and yields, lower cost and better value for customers.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P172_S1	Garmin s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and rugged.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P173_S0	Operating our own manufacturing and distribution facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P173_S1	Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P174_S0	Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P174_S1	Operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows Garmin to quickly adjust the mix of product production, helping to foster faster delivery response to the customer.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P175_S0	Garmin s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P175_S1	Garmin s automotive operations in Taiwan and Olathe have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P175_S2	In addition, Garmin s aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P176_S0	Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P176_S1	This certification recognizes that Garmin s subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P177_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components, including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ), and certain application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs ) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P177_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P178_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P178_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P179_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P179_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P179_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P179_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P179_S4	Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin s requirements.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P180_S0	Our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P180_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand for automotive/mobile products during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the Father s Day/graduation buying season.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P180_S2	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P180_S3	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P181_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P181_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P182_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P182_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P182_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P182_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P183_S0	As of January 23, 2011, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 600 patents and 400 trademark registrations.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P183_S1	Garmin was selected as a constituent of the 2011/2012 Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P184_S0	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P184_S1	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P185_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P185_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P186_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P186_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P187_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P187_S1	In accordance with Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P187_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P187_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P187_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P188_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P188_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P188_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P188_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P189_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P189_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P190_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P190_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P190_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P191_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P191_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P191_S2	Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P192_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P193_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P193_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P193_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P194_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System ( EMS ) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P194_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facility.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P195_S0	Regulatory and Green Procurement demands from our customers are also increasing, particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P195_S1	The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P196_S0	Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P197_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Garmin had 9,229 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,403 were in the United States, 62 were in Canada, 4,403 were in Taiwan, 1,023 were in Europe, and 338 were in other global locations.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P197_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_12_ITEM1_P198_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 58% of our revenues and is maturing.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2012 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices (PNDs) that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V. NAVTEQ Corporation is owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P58_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may have additional tax liabilities.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P62_S6	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S5	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The shutdown of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Any future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	GPS is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	For example, the FCC is currently considering a proposal by a private party, LightSquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If the FCC were to permit implementation of LightSquared s proposal as is, terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P88_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P88_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the EPA has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P94_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P94_S2	It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business .
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P97_S1	During 2011, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $30.14 to a high of $40.39.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P97_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	As of January 10, 2012, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 44.40% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P101_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association and organizational regulations.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P103_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P103_S4	Swiss law also provides that dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S2	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S4	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S5	In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P105_S6	If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P106_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the Swiss Stock Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are the principal properties owned or leased by the Company and its subsidiaries:
1121788_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. occupy a facility of approximately 1,120,000 square feet on 42 acres in Olathe, Kansas, where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured and products are warehoused, distributed, and supported for North, Central and South America.

1121788_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S7	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P15_S8	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Concurrently, market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The impact of the 2011 change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	service, which provides direct links to certain online information.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Additional models were introduced in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the n vi products with the n Link feature.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the n Link service.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	The revenue and associated cost allocated to the n Link services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the service, which is either 12 or 24 months.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	We sell our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer s financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	We determine these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Garmin s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Investment income is recorded when earned, and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Fair value of investments in auction rate securities, if any, are determined using third party estimates which follow an income approach valuation methodology.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	It is Garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin s compensation package for employees.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Certain employees within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to vest.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion above.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	In 2011, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 280 basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products and decreased selling prices on comparable units, as well as positive impact to 2010 gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs than in the prior year, thereby lowering gross profit by $143 million in the current year compared to $100 million for the prior year.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	See Note 2 for further information on gross profit deferrals.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	In 2010, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	In addition, the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix began to be impacted by a shift toward products bundled with lifetime maps.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	This was partially offset by a positive refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	In 2009, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	In 2011, we also experienced a 420 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	Gross margins for the aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness segments are typically more stable.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P39_S6	Our long-term gross margin targets are 65%, 55%, 65%, and 55%, respectively, for these segments.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Sijhih, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	As revenues grew in 2009, advertising expense also increased.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	In 2010, we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	In 2011, our advertising costs increased slightly as we again experienced revenue growth.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	We expect advertising costs to increase slightly in 2012 but remain consistent as a percentage of net sales.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in both 2011 and 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The 2011 increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, commissions associated with a new web-based sales program, bad debt expense, legal costs and product support costs.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	The 2010 increase was primarily due to legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Due to the economic pressure on our consumer-oriented business, we decreased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to increase slightly in 2012 due to the acquisitions made in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Approximately 82% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	The remainder of our research and development activities is performed primarily by our Taiwan engineering group.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect our research and development budget to increase in 2012 due to recent acquisitions and our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our top ten customers have contributed between 29% and 36% of net sales since 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 71 and 78 days since 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	We experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days in 2010 due to changes in product mix, longer payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions but this was reduced in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	We expect the level of customer accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in 2012.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 10.8% during 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	This is a decrease from an effective rate of 15.8%, excluding certain one-time tax benefits, in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	The decrease in 2011 resulted primarily from the release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes for the Company s United Kingdom subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd., a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Taiwan from 25% to 17%, and improved operating profitability in lower tax jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P48_S5	We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Management believes that due to slightly lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2012, there may be less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be higher than fiscal 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2012, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Net sales increased 3% in 2011 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase occurred in all segments excluding automotive/mobile.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	The fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 24% with outdoor contributing 14% growth.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 62% in 2010 to 58% in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Total unit sales decreased 1% to 15.8 million units in 2011 from 16.0 million units in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2011 was attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American PND market slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 5% in 2011, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 5%.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	ASP was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services, as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $179.3 million of net sales in 2011 compared to $131.3 million of net sales in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to a change in accounting estimate.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	As bundled products increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales in 2011, including the impact of new product introductions, market conditions also caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	In addition, the difference in pricing of such bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably since 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S6	Due to the impact of these and other factors, the Company changed its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P54_S7	The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in net sales of $77.8 million in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Fitness segment revenue increased 24% on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Outdoor revenue increased 14% driven by new product introductions and market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Marine revenues increased 12% due to shipments to new OEM partners and market share gains.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Aviation revenues increased 9% as the Company s retrofit business began to recover on the strength of new panel mount avionics products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company anticipates revenue of $2.7 - $2.8 billion in 2012 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 6% in 2011 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	This adjustment impacted all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor, fitness and marine having the largest benefits.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Excluding this 2010 adjustment, cost of goods sold increased 3% which is consistent with the change in revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cost per unit increased in all segments with increases in outdoor and fitness generally consistent with ASP increases.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Automotive/mobile increased due to product mix shifting toward bundled PNDs.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Marine and aviation cost per unit increases exceeded ASP growth which negatively impacted gross margins for these respective segments due to product mix shift toward fishfinders in marine and retrofit panel mount products in aviation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be stable in 2012 given current component pricing.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2011 decreased 1% while gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points compared to 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Gross profit margins declined in all segments when compared to 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Gross margins in 2010 were positively impacted due to the $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to the refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decreased 280 basis points driven primarily by the 2010 warranty benefit and the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs, thereby lowering gross profit by $143.2 million in the current year compared to $99.9 million for the prior year.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to the previously discussed change in accounting estimate.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in gross profit of $66.5 million in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Outdoor and fitness gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily by the 2010 warranty benefit.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	Marine gross profit margin percentage decreased 420 basis points driven by the 2010 warranty benefit, a 2011 increase in warranty reserves to account for geographic mix and a product mix shift toward lower margin products including fishfinders.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Aviation gross profit margin percentage decreased 300 basis points driven primarily by a lower margin profile for our retrofit panel mount products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will be stable in 2012 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Advertising expense increased slightly in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	As a percent of revenues, advertising expenses were 5% in both 2011 and 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The slight increase in absolute dollars resulted from increased investment for outdoor and fitness advertising, which are the segments experiencing the most growth, offset by reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners as PND units declined and the elimination of mobile handset specific advertising.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2012.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 11% of revenues in 2010 to 12% of revenues in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by acquisitions ($21.3 million), commissions associated with a new web-based sales program ($4.3 million), bad debt expense ($3.5 million), legal costs ($9.3 million), and product support costs ($6.1 million).
1121788_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Aviation costs declined year-over-year due to a reduction in bad debt expense driven by improved cash collections.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in absolute dollars in 2012 due to the acquisitions made in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of approximately 225 new engineering personnel due primarily to acquisitions offset by the discontinuation of costs associated with the mobile handset initiative.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $21.3 million when compared with the year-ago period and increased 50 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2012 on an absolute dollar basis in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Operating income decreased 360 basis points as a percent of revenue and 13% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin declined and operating expenses increased.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2011 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year and a slight increase in interest rates.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The $12.1 million currency loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The $88.4 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our earnings before taxes increased 1% when compared to 2010 and our income tax expense increased by $70.6 million, to $63.3 million for fiscal year 2011 from ($7.3) million for fiscal year 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The significant increase in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2009 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 10.8% for 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P78_S4	The decrease is primarily due to the 2011 release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes for Garmin Europe, a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Taiwan from 25% to 17%, and improved operating profitability in lower tax jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 11% to $520.9 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $584.6 million for fiscal year 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net sales decreased 9% in 2010 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by revenue growth in outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 42%.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 70% in 2009 to 62% in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Total unit sales decreased 4% to 16.0 million units in 2010 from 16.6 million units in 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2010 was attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units due to increased saturation in the segment and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation segments.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 19% in 2010, as the average selling price and volumes declined 11% and 9%, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Outdoor segment revenue increased 7% due to new product introductions that both refreshed existing products and expanded the addressable market.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Fitness segment revenue increased 42% on the strength of recent product introductions that expand the addressable market and ongoing global penetration.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Marine revenues increased 12% due to product introductions, slight industry recovery and market share gains.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	Aviation revenues increased 7% as the Company delivered into additional cockpits and the retrofit business began to recover.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 11% in 2010 when compared to 2009 which was generally consistent with the change in revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	The absolute dollar decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by cost of goods increases in outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	This adjustment impacted all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor, fitness and marine having the largest benefits.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	Cost per unit declined in all segments driving stable to improving margins in outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2010 decreased 7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 110 basis points compared to 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Gross profit margins were stable to increasing in all segments excluding the automotive/mobile segment when compared to 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decrease of 160 basis points was driven by an 11% decrease in average selling price which was only partially offset by a decline in per unit costs including the warranty benefit.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	Gross profit dollars of the automotive/mobile segment declined to 50% of total gross profit dollars from 60% in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Gross profit dollars for marine increased 18% compared to 2009 due to product mix shifting toward higher margin units.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Gross profit dollars for fitness increased by 43% to $149.7 million due to strong revenue growth in the segment.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Advertising expense decreased 7% in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	As a percent of revenues, advertising expenses were 5% in both 2010 and 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	The absolute dollar decrease occurred primarily in the automotive/mobile segment due to reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners partially offset by mobile handset specific advertising.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	Further offsetting the decline was increased advertising for fitness where we continue to invest for growth.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 9% of revenues in 2009 to 11% of revenues in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	Aviation costs declined year-over-year due to a 2009 bad debt accrual driven by cash collection risks associated with several of our customers that did not reoccur in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Research and development expense increased 16% due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative which has now been cancelled, and the addition of over 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $38.9 million primarily in the auto/mobile segment, when compared with the year-ago period and increased 220 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	Outdoor research and development expense increased 80% due to new initiatives including golf and tracking products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating income decreased 300 basis points as a percent of revenue and 19% in absolute dollars when compared to 2009 as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	The automotive/mobile operating margin declined from 22% in 2009 to 15% in 2010 due to a 160 basis point decline in gross margins and selling, general and administrative and research and development expense increases during a period of declining revenues.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The fitness operating margin dollars increased 55% driven by gross margin dollars and increased leverage on research and development expenses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	The aviation operating margin increased from 24% in 2009 to 28% in 2010 as gross margins improved 100 basis points.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal 2010 relative to fiscal 2009, with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	Interest income for fiscal 2010 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year partially offset by decreasing interest rates.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The $88.4 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	During 2010, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The $6.0 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of $5.8 million.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P96_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $4.3 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our earnings before taxes fell 29% when compared to 2009 and our income tax expense decreased by $112.0 million, to ($7.3) million, for fiscal year 2010 from $104.7 million for fiscal year 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The significant decline in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2009 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 12.9% for 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate as compared to 2009 is largely due to an unfavorable mix of income among taxing jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 17% to $584.6 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to $704.0 million for fiscal year 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Net cash generated by operations was $822.3 million, $770.6 million, and $1,094.5 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	Primary drivers of the cash generation in 2011 included: $520.9 million of net income with non-cash adjustments for depreciation/amortization of $94.5 million and stock compensation expense of $40.2 million; $169.5 million related to decreased accounts receivable due to increased cash collections resulting from the 53-week year in 2011 and improved payment terms with customers; and $179.4 million of deferred revenue as required by our revenue recognition policies.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	This cash generation was partially offset by uses of cash including a $61.1 million reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities related primarily to a decrease in accrued sales program costs due to the impact of reduced channel inventory, $51.4 million increase in other current assets related primarily to a receivable due from the Swiss Federal Tax Authority that has subsequently been received, and $36.1 million of net deferred costs associated with bundled products.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	The increase in cash flow from operations over 2010 levels was due to improved working capital gains in accounts payable, inventories and accounts receivable offset by reduced working capital from other current assets and reduced net income.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P100_S4	We expect to generate cash flow from operations in 2012 with ongoing net income, as well as working capital.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cash flow used in investing activities was $ 488.2 million, $72.9 million, and $547.9 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	Cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to the net redemption of or investment in fixed income securities, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	Capital expenditures in 2011 totaled $38.4 million and related to business operations and maintenance activities.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	We have budgeted approximately $50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, net investment in fixed income securities of our on-hand cash was $393.3 million, $25.5 million and $491.0 million, respectively, as we invested excess cash.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S5	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S6	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S7	Garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S8	In 2011, cash flow used in investing activities included $54.2 million for the acquisitions of NAVIGON AG, Tri-Tronics Inc., and two global distributors.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P101_S9	In 2010, cash flow used in investing activities included $12.1 million for the acquisition of MetriGear, Inc.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was $307.4 million resulting from the use of $310.8 million for payment of our declared dividend offset by the net impact of transactions related to our Company stock option plans and stock based compensation tax benefits.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Our dividend has progressively increased from $0.75 per share in 2009 to $1.50 per share in 2010 and $1.60 per share in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2012.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 31, 2011, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Operating leases describes lease obligations associated with Garmin facilities located in the U.S., Taiwan, Europe, and Canada.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $161.9 million as of December 31, 2011, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	All European subsidiaries excluding Garmin (Europe) Ltd., Garmin Danmark, Garmin Sweden, Garmin Polska and Garmin Norge use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	In 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 1.3% relative to the Euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $4.8 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S4	The U.S. Dollar weakened 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $4.1 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P7_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $3.2 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $12.1 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $76.0 million at the end of fiscal 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses.
1121788_12_ITEM7A_P9_S3	At December 31, 2011, cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were $11.5 million.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and management.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related products.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC), wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd., is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to Garmin International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC, and Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	GII is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in many international markets and in the United States as well as research and new product development.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures certain products for the Company s aviation segment.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	GEL is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products, principally within the European market.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	Fiscal 2010 and 2009 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2011 included 53 weeks.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of $76,456 and $61,740 as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange losses of $12,100, $88,377, and $6,040 for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S3	The loss in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of the slight strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the slight weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S4	The loss in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P11_S5	The loss in fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar offset by the weakening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P14_S7	In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cost is determined using the weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII and GEL.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2011, 2010, or 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	On June 27, 2010, the Company completed the redomestication of the place of our incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	On June 3, 2011, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.00 per share (of which, $1.60 was paid in the Company's 2011 fiscal year) payable in four installments as follows: $0.80 on June 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2011, $0.40 on September 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2011, $0.40 on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 15, 2011 and $0.40 on March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2012.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company paid dividends in 2011 in the amount of $310,763.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable have been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	On March 16, 2010 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on April 30, 2010 to shareholders of record on April 15, 2010.

1121788_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	The dividend was reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Approximately $239,470 and $213,486 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, the Company had patents, license agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $206,872 and $152,138, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $179,475 at December 31, 2011 and $136,548 at December 25, 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	The increase in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in 2011 is principally related to the acquisitions completed by the Company, as further described in Note 15.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	Accumulated amortization was $134,184 and $103,534 at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Amortization expense was $33,225, $36,675, and $37,444 for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $28,464, $14,413, $9,518, $6,978, and $5,301, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 31, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of $10,737 and ($5,736), respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss), net of related taxes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes .
1121788_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	Income taxes of $252,793, $233,028, and $171,097 at December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 was $161,904 including interest of $10,850.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for years ending December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009 is as follows:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The December 31, 2011 balance of $161,904 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	The entire $161,904, $153,621, and $255,748 are required to be classified as non-current at December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Interest expense and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	At December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, the Company had accrued approximately $10,850, $9,580, and $20,160, respectively, for interest.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	Interest expense (income) included in income tax expense for the years ending December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009 is $5,568, ($10,580), and $9,000, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008.

1121788_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company also considers 2008 U.S. federal returns to have been effectively settled due to completion of an audit examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	A reduction of income tax expense was recognized to reflect this settlement.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	In addition, the Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $19,610, $24,066, and $19,771 in fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $20,482 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 29% and 36% of net sales since 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	In 2011, the Company purchased trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Best Buy, a customer in the outdoor, fitness, marine and auto/mobile segments accounted for less than 10% of the Company s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively, while accounting for 13.4% of the Company s consolidated net sales in the year ended December 26, 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P48_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P48_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	For multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S5	The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S6	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S7	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P54_S8	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Concurrently, market conditions have caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models has decreased considerably.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The impact of the 2011 change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.

1121788_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	Additional models were introduced in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the n vi products with the n Link feature.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the n Link service.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P60_S4	The revenue and associated cost allocated to the n Link services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the service, which is either 12 or 24 months.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P61_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on the Company s historical experience.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $377,119 and $197,787, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $80,856 and $44,738, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	In the next three years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $148,954, $108,156, and $39,153, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1121788_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	The warranty period for most products is one year to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation and certain marine products have a warranty period of three years from the date of shipment .
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P67_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $145,024, $144,613, and $155,521 for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $298,584, $277,261, and $238,378 for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P71_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to fair value measurements and disclosure requirements that result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for the measurement and disclosure of fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	This standard provides certain amendments to the existing guidance on the use and application of fair value measurements and maintains a definition of fair value that is based on the notion of exit price.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this amendment, but it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	This guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	The guidance allows two presentation alternatives; present items in net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S4	Early adoption is permitted, but full retrospective application is required under both sets of accounting standards.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P76_S5	The Company is currently evaluating which presentation alternative it will utilize.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	Under the amendment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads the entity to determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test for goodwill is unnecessary.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S3	If the entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to test goodwill for impairment under the two-step process as described under paragraphs 350-20-35-4 of the ASC.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S4	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, as described in paragraph 350-20-35-9 of the ASC.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P77_S6	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this amendment, but it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	For fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, an independent third party provided the valuation.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	The inputs used in the valuations were completed using the following methodology.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	The collateral composition was used to estimate Weighted Average Life based on historical and projected payment information.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	Cash flows were projected for the issuing trusts, taking into account underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding, and payout formulas.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	Taking this information into account, assumptions were made as to the yields likely to be required, based upon then current market conditions for comparable or similar term Asset Based Securities as well as other fixed income securities.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	All Level 3 investments at December 25, 2010 had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	However, it was the Company s intent to hold these securities until they recovered their value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P84_S2	The Company sold these securities during 2011 and realized an immaterial loss.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the period, the accounting guidance requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately for each major category of assets.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following is a summary of the company s marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2011:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following is a summary of the company s marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities at December 25, 2010:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	The unrealized losses and unrealized gains on the Company s investments in 2010 and 2011, respectively, were caused primarily by changes in interest rates and credit spreads.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P90_S2	Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P91_S2	During 2010 and 2011, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2011, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	Included in the $55,694 amount below is $34,590 that has been classified as current because the underlying securities were sold subsequent to year-end.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	The remaining amount of $21,104 has been classified as noncurrent.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $14,277, $11,768, and $10,293 for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank, securing payment of the United Kingdom value-added tax requirements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $771 and $1,277 at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P98_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	GII sponsors a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which its employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which GII contributes a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the Plan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	Both GII and GEL contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P99_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, expense related to these plans of $20,647, $17,952, and $16,399 was charged to operations.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P100_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, were significant.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the redomestication effective June 27, 2010 (see Note 12), is 7.83%.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P103_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2011, as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $158,716 lower, or $45,740, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $10,658.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P103_S2	For 2010, the amounts related to tax at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% prior to the redomestication and the Swiss statutory rate of 7.83%, subsequent to the redomestication, would be approximately $95,985 lower, or $106,060, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by the same amount to ($19,648).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P103_S3	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $473,994, $413,550, and $678,868, for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $0.07, $0.07, and $0.09 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P104_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2016, at which time these tax benefits might expire.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P105_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company recognized a $29,615 deferred tax asset during 2010 for the future tax benefit of the fair market value step-up in basis of intangible assets related to the redomestication to Switzerland and local statutory tax reporting requirements.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The deferred tax asset was recognized as an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital in 2010 and will reverse as the intangible assets are amortized for Swiss statutory and tax reporting purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had $33,379 of tax credit carryover which includes $31,240 of Taiwan surtax credit with no expiration.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P107_S1	There is a full valuation allowance for the Taiwan surtax credits.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P107_S2	The valuation allowance decreased by $14,179 during 2011 including $14,994 related to Taiwan surtax credits.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P107_S3	The decrease in the surtax credit carryforward and valuation allowance in 2011 is principally due to reducing the amount of such credits to the correct amount available for use in future years, on which a full valuation reserve is provided.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $17,780 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $72,197.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $24,680 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2025, $14,718 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2018, and $32,799 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	Beginning in 2011, for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating segments auto/mobile, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	Prior to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of those products, their production processes, the types of customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic conditions.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P112_S3	Management re-evaluated the combination of these operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics of these segments they should now be reported as two distinct reportable segments.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEM s.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company s marine, auto/mobile, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income before income taxes of each segment.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Revenues, interest income and interest expense, and income before income taxes for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	Net sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P121_S1	Note that APAC includes Asia Pacific and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	(1) Majority of assets held in the United States and Taiwan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	For all stock compensation plans, the company s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/SAR exercises, RSU releases and ESPP purchases.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	In June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the 2011 Directors Plan) providing for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	The term of each award cannot exceed ten years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	During 2011, 11,996 restricted stock units were granted under this plan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	In June 2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the 2005 Plan ) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P125_S1	The various grants vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	During 2011, 2010, and 2009, 410,197, 494,995, and 470,950 restricted stock units were granted under the 2005 Plan.

1121788_12_ITEM8_P126_S3	No performance shares were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	In October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the 2000 Plan ) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares were available for issuance.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	Also in October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the 2000 Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up to 100,000 common shares.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	The term of each award is ten years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P128_S2	All awards vest evenly over a three-year period.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	During 2010 and 2009, options to purchase 23,924 and 34,648 shares, respectively, were granted under this plan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P129_S2	Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares under this plan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	A summary of the Company s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Directors Plan for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009 is provided below:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2011 is 4.80 and 4.57 years, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 31, 2011 was 2.21 years.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2011, 2010, and 2009:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	The total fair value of awards vested during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $49,006, $41,249, and $41,527, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2011 were $35,683 and $35,410, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S2	The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs exercised during 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $14,367, $12,259, and $3,578, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S3	The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2011 was $58,856.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S4	The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $14,592, $8,828, and $6,327, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P134_S5	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period, which was $39.81 on December 30, 2011, and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there was $58,554 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P135_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	The shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	Up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP with shareholders approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in May 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S2	Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S3	The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S4	During 2011, 2010, and 2009, 514,218, 349,173, and 209,416 shares, respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $13,746, $8,134, and $3,874, respectively.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S5	During 2011 and 2010, the purchases were issued from treasury shares.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P136_S6	At December 31, 2011, approximately 1,561,066 shares were available for future issuance.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:
1121788_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	Options to purchase 5,920,076, 6,192,043, and 7,814,095 common shares were outstanding during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 12, 2010, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant on the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC s Rule 10b-18.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2011.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	Under the plan, the Company had repurchased 7,366,646 shares using cash of $223,149 in fiscal 2010.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	In addition, 522,856 shares repurchased for $16,701 prior to the Company s redomestication to Switzerland on June 27, 2010, but for which transactions settled after that date, were treated as retired when such shares were still in treasury.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	These shares were reflected as additional treasury shares during the 13-weeks ended March 26, 2011 with a corresponding increase to retained earnings.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on October 22, 2008, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P141_S1	The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2009.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P141_S2	From inception to expiration, $60,000 of common shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	The redomestication effectively changed the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of Garmin from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.
1121788_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	On February 9, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) formed Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) as a direct subsidiary.

1121788_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	This discussion of the business of Garmin Ltd. ( Garmin or the Company ) should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Beginning in 2011, for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating segments Auto/Mobile, Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Prior to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of those products, their production processes, the types of customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	Management re-evaluated the combination of these operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics of these segments they should now be reported as two distinct reportable segments.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	The segment and geographic information included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 8 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1 and has been restated to reflect the five operating segments as discussed above for all periods presented.

1121788_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Prior to May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability ( SA ) for national security purposes.

1121788_13_ITEM1_P175_S0	Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P175_S1	This certification recognizes that Garmin s subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P176_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components, including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ), and certain application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs ) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P176_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P177_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P177_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P178_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P178_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P178_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P178_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P178_S4	Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin s requirements.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P179_S0	Our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P179_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the Father s Day/graduation buying season.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P180_S1	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P181_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P181_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P182_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P182_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P182_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P183_S0	As of February 1, 2013, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 725 patents and 554 trademark registrations.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P183_S1	Garmin was selected as a constituent of the 2012/2013 Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P184_S0	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P184_S1	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P185_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P185_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P186_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P186_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P187_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P187_S1	In accordance with Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P187_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P187_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P187_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P188_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P188_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P188_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P188_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P189_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P189_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P190_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P190_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P190_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P191_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P191_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P191_S2	Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P192_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P193_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P193_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P193_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P194_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System ( EMS ) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P194_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facility.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P195_S0	Regulatory and Green Procurement demands from our customers are also increasing, particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P195_S1	The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P196_S0	Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P197_S0	As of December 29, 2012, Garmin had 9,777 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,678 were in the United States, 70 were in Canada, 4,469 were in Taiwan, 1,102 were in Europe, and 458 were in other global locations.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P197_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_13_ITEM1_P198_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	From 2005 to 2008, we experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This has resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduced margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 55% of our revenues, is maturing and expected to further decline in 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower revenues and lower earnings per share.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have declined and could further decline in the future due to price reductions in the competitive market for navigation solutions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our selling, general and administrative and research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V. NAVTEQ Corporation is owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P58_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may have additional tax liabilities.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P62_S6	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S5	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The shutdown of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Any future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	GPS is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P88_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P88_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business .
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	During 2012, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $35.84 to a high of $49.33.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	As of January 9, 2013, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.48% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P101_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association and organizational regulations.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P103_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P105_S2	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P105_S4	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	There are currently legislative projects pending in Swiss Parliament and the Swiss federal administration that depending on their final form may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P106_S2	If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P107_S3	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_13_ITEM1A_P108_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.

1121788_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2012 and 2010 contained 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks for 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company s fiscal year and fiscal periods.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to we, us, our and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our portable GPS receivers and accessories for marine, outdoor, fitness and automotive/mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Approximately 79% of sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	We experienced ($20.0) million, ($12.1) million, and ($88.4) million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Concurrently, market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The impact in 2011 of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We sell our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer s financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	We determine these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Garmin s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Investment income is recorded when earned, and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	It is Garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin s compensation package for employees.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Certain employees within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected life, forfeitures and dividends.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion above.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	In 2012, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues, the third quarter 2011 change in estimate of per unit revenue and cost deferred as previously discussed and a one-time royalty fee adjustment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on gross profit deferrals.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	In 2011, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 280 basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products, partially offset by the change in estimate mentioned above, and decreased selling prices on comparable units, as well as positive impact to 2010 gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs than in the prior year, thereby lowering gross profit by $143 million in 2011 compared to $100 million for the prior year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	In 2010, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	In addition, the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix began to be impacted by a shift toward products bundled with lifetime maps.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	This was partially offset by a positive refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	In 2012, we experienced a 320 and 260 basis point increase in aviation and fitness gross margins, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Aviation gross margin expansion was driven primarily by product mix and a OEM program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Fitness gross margin improvement was due to product mix.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	In 2011, we experienced a 420 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	Gross margins for the aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness segments are typically more stable than in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	Our long-term gross margin targets are 65%, 60%, 65%, and 60%, respectively, for these segments.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Sijhih, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	In both 2012 and 2010, we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	In 2011, our advertising costs increased slightly as we again experienced revenue growth.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	We expect advertising costs to decrease slightly in 2013 but to remain consistent as a percentage of net sales.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The 2012 increase was primarily driven by full year expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011 and legal costs.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The 2011 increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, commissions associated with a new web-based sales program, bad debt expense, legal costs and product support costs.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	The 2010 increase was primarily due to legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to be stable in 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Approximately 80% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect our research and development budget to increase in 2013 due to our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our top ten customers have contributed between 26% and 34% of net sales since 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 70 and 78 days since 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	We experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days in 2010 due to changes in product mix, longer payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions but this was reduced in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	We expect the level of customer accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 13.1% during 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	This is an increase from an effective rate of 10.8% in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The lower effective tax rate in 2011 was primarily driven by the release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations for Garmin Europe.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S5	This was partially offset by the release of income tax reserves due to the expiration of a statute of limitations in Taiwan during 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S6	We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S7	Management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2013, there may be less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S8	Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be higher than fiscal 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P48_S9	The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2013, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net sales decreased 2% in 2012 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The decrease was driven by automotive/mobile and marine with offsetting growth in outdoor, fitness and aviation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The outdoor segment experienced the greatest increase at 11% with fitness contributing 8% growth.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 58% in 2011 to 55% in 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Total unit sales decreased 3% to 15.4 million units in 2012 from 15.8 million units in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2012 was primarily attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American and European PND markets slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	This decline was partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor and fitness segments, as well as auto OEM units.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 6% in 2012, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 6%.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	ASP was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services, as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $68.3 million of net sales in 2012 compared to $179.3 million of net sales in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The reduced impact of deferred revenue is related to increased amortization of previously deferred revenues and costs and a reduced per unit revenue deferral rate due to a change in accounting estimate in the third quarter of 2011, as previously discussed, offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral..
1121788_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Outdoor revenue increased 11% driven by market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category and the dog tracking and training portfolio including the benefit of an acquisition completed in the second half of 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Fitness segment revenue increased 8% on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration though slowing from 24% growth in the prior year when we had significant promotional activity on discontinued products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Marine revenues decreased 6% due to a difficult international marine environment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	Aviation revenues increased 2% as the Company s OEM business began to recover but was partially offset by declining sales of retrofit and portable products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company anticipates revenue of $2.5 - $2.6 billion in 2013 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 10% in 2012 when compared to the year-ago period primarily due to unit volume declines discussed above, component cost reductions, a mix shift toward higher margin new products and certain factors specific to the automotive/mobile segment discussed below.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the automotive/mobile segment decreased by 560 basis points.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	The decline principally resulted from a $21 million one-time royalty fee benefit recorded in second quarter (140 basis points) and subsequent impact of reduced royalty costs, a reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and costs including the reduced per unit deferral rate as discussed above (280 basis points), component price reductions and product mix shifting toward more recently introduced products carrying a higher margin profile.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Fitness and marine posted declines in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due to product mix moving toward newer products with increased features, functionality and higher per unit margins, as well as decreased promotional activities.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Aviation posted a decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due primarily to product mix and a prior year OEM contribution that negatively impacted revenues.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will decline in 2013 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average and current component pricing.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2012 increased 7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 450 basis points compared to 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Gross profit margins increased in all segments, excluding outdoor, when compared to 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the one-time royalty fee adjustment, a $90 million reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and cost including the reduced per unit deferral rate partially offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral, reduced component pricing and improved product mix, as discussed above.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Fitness and marine gross profit margin percentage increased 260 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily by product mix improvement and less promotional activity in the current year, as discussed above.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Aviation gross profit margin percentage increased 320 basis points driven primarily by product mix and a prior year OEM contribution, as discussed above.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will increase in 2013 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Advertising expense decreased in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	The decrease in absolute dollars resulted from reduced cooperative advertising on lower sales in the PND category partially offset by increased cooperative advertising and media placement within the outdoor, fitness and marine segments.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 120 basis points in 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by full year expense for acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011, which added almost $20 million, and increased legal costs and reserves partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense and commissions expense.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable in absolute dollars in 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Research and development expense increased 9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 375 new engineering personnel with an emphasis on OEM opportunities within aviation, auto and marine.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $27.2 million when compared with the year-ago period and increased 120 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2013 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Operating income increased 210 basis points as a percent of revenue and 9% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin improvement was only partially offset by increased operating expenses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2012 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year offset by a slight decline in interest rates.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The $20.0 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	During 2012, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $31.3 million.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	This was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a $10.4 million gain.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The remaining net currency gain of $0.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The $12.1 million currency loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our earnings before taxes increased 7% when compared to 2011 while our income tax expense increased by 30% to $82.1 million, compared to $63.3 million for fiscal year 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The significant increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the income eligible for tax holiday in Taiwan, unfavorable income mix toward higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, net of amounts released due to expiration of statutes of limitations, and the impact of no research and development credit in 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 4% to $542.4 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $520.9 million for fiscal year 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net sales increased 3% in 2011 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase occurred in all segments excluding automotive/mobile.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	The fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 24% with outdoor contributing 14% growth.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 62% in 2010 to 58% in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Total unit sales decreased 1% to 15.8 million units in 2011 from 16.0 million units in 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2011 was attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American PND market slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 5% in 2011, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 5%.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	ASP was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services, as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $179.3 million of net sales in 2011 compared to $131.3 million of net sales in 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to a change in accounting estimate.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S4	As bundled products increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales in 2011, including the impact of new product introductions, market conditions also caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S5	In addition, the difference in pricing of such bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably since 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S6	Due to the impact of these and other factors, the Company changed its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P81_S7	The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in net sales of $77.8 million in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Fitness segment revenue increased 24% on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Outdoor revenue increased 14% driven by new product introductions and market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Marine revenues increased 12% due to shipments to new OEM partners and market share gains.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	Aviation revenues increased 9% as the Company s retrofit business began to recover on the strength of new panel mount avionics products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 6% in 2011 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	This adjustment impacted all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor, fitness and marine having the largest benefits.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	Excluding this 2010 adjustment, cost of goods sold increased 3% which is consistent with the change in revenue.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cost per unit increased in all segments with increases in outdoor and fitness generally consistent with ASP increases.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Automotive/mobile increased due to product mix shifting toward bundled PNDs.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Marine and aviation cost per unit increases exceeded ASP growth which negatively impacted gross margins for these respective segments due to product mix shift toward fishfinders in marine and retrofit panel mount products in aviation.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2011 decreased 1% while gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points compared to 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Gross profit margins declined in all segments when compared to 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Gross margins in 2010 were positively impacted due to the $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to the refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decreased 280 basis points driven primarily by the 2010 warranty benefit and the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs, thereby lowering gross profit by $143.2 million in the current year compared to $99.9 million for the prior year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to the previously discussed change in accounting estimate.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in gross profit of $66.5 million in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Outdoor and fitness gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily by the 2010 warranty benefit.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Marine gross profit margin percentage decreased 420 basis points driven by the 2010 warranty benefit, a 2011 increase in warranty reserves to account for geographic mix and a product mix shift toward lower margin products including fishfinders.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	Aviation gross profit margin percentage decreased 300 basis points driven primarily by a lower margin profile for our retrofit panel mount products.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Advertising expense increased slightly in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	As a percent of revenues, advertising expenses were 5% in both 2011 and 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	The slight increase in absolute dollars resulted from increased investment for outdoor and fitness advertising, which are the segments experiencing the most growth, offset by reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners as PND units declined and the elimination of mobile handset specific advertising.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 11% of revenues in 2010 to 12% of revenues in 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by acquisitions ($21.3 million), commissions associated with a new web-based sales program ($4.3 million), bad debt expense ($3.5 million), legal costs ($9.3 million), and product support costs ($6.1 million).
1121788_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	Aviation costs declined year-over-year due to a reduction in bad debt expense driven by improved cash collections.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of approximately 225 new engineering personnel due primarily to acquisitions offset by the discontinuation of costs associated with the mobile handset initiative.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $21.3 million when compared with the year-ago period and increased 50 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating income decreased 360 basis points as a percent of revenue and 13% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin declined and operating expenses increased.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2011 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year and a slight increase in interest rates.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The $12.1 million currency loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The $88.4 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our earnings before taxes increased 1% when compared to 2010 and our income tax expense increased by $70.6 million, to $63.3 million for fiscal year 2011 from ($7.3) million for fiscal year 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	The significant increase in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2009 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 10.8% for 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	The decrease is primarily due to the 2011 release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes for Garmin Europe, a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Taiwan from 25% to 17%, and improved operating profitability in lower tax jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 11% to $520.9 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $584.6 million for fiscal year 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The $137.6 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The $51.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	We expect to generate $500 - $550 million of cash flow from operations in 2013 with ongoing net income.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	The $8.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The $415.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	We have budgeted approximately $40 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	Garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were approximately 1.4%, 1.6%, and 1.2%, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The $57.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	The $203.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our dividend has progressively increased from $1.50 per share in calendar 2010 to $1.60 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2011 and $1.80 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2013.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 29, 2012, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Operating leases describes lease obligations associated with Garmin facilities located in the U.S., Taiwan, Europe, and Canada.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company is a party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $186,883 over the next five years.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $181.8 million as of December 29, 2012, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	In 2012, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $10.4 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S4	The U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $31.3 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P7_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $0.8 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $20.0 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $129.0 million at the end of fiscal 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 29, 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses.
1121788_13_ITEM7A_P9_S3	At December 29, 2012, pre-tax cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were $10.4 million.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and management.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related products.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	Fiscal years 2012 and 2010 included 52 weeks while fiscal year 2011 included 53 weeks.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of $128,972 and $76,456 as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange losses of $20,022, $12,100, and $88,377 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	The loss in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S4	The loss in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of the slight strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the slight weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P11_S5	The loss in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P14_S7	In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2012, 2011, or 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	On June 27, 2010, the Company completed the redomestication of the place of its incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.

1121788_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Accumulated amortization was $125,380 and $106,648 at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $21,437, $24,831, and $28,734 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $21,239, $10,960, $8,311, $6,269, and $2,754, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $176,059 at December 29, 2012 and $179,475 at December 31, 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The decrease in net identifiable intangible assets is principally related to amortization, partially offset by acquisitions completed in 2012 and other purchases of intangible assets.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 29, 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	At December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of $9,582 and $10,737, respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes .
1121788_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	Income taxes of $295,446, $277,724, and $257,727 at December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2012 was $181,754 including interest of $7,680.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 is as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	The December 29, 2012 balance of $181,754 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	The entire $181,754, $161,904, and $153,621 are required to be classified as non-current at December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	At December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, the Company had accrued approximately $7,680, $10,850, and $9,580, respectively, for interest.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 by ($3,719), $5,568, and ($10,580), respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2008 and prior.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2006 and prior.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2009 and prior.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $9,349, $19,610, and $24,066 in fiscal years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $78,372 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 26% and 34% of net sales since 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Beginning in 2011, the Company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P47_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	For multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP ).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S5	The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S6	The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S7	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P52_S8	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Concurrently, market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	The impact in 2011 of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P57_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on the Company s historical experience.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	At December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $445,422 and $377,119, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $96,307 and $80,856, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	In the next three years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $198,427, $113,528, and $37,160, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	The warranty period for most products is one year to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P63_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $138,757, $145,024, and $144,613 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $325,773, $298,584, and $277,261 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects a reclassification decreasing noncurrent deferred income tax assets by $18.5 million with increases of $10.7 million to current deferred income tax assets and $7.8 million to prepaid expenses and other current assets, to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	This reclassification had no effect on net income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to fair value measurements and disclosure requirements that result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for the measurement and disclosure of fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	This standard provides certain amendments to the existing guidance on the use and application of fair value measurements and maintains a definition of fair value that is based on the notion of exit price.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P72_S3	The Company adopted this guidance in the current year with no material impact on the financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	This guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	The guidance allows two presentation alternatives; present items in net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S3	This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S4	Early adoption is permitted, but full retrospective application is required under both sets of accounting standards.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P73_S5	The Company adopted this guidance in the current year and has chosen to present two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Under the amendment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads the entity to determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test for goodwill is unnecessary.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S3	If the entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to test goodwill for impairment under the two-step process as described under paragraphs 350-20-35-4 of the ASC.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S4	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, as described in paragraph 350-20-35-9 of the ASC.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S5	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P74_S6	The Company adopted this guidance in the current year with no material impact on the financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02 Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), which is included in ASC Topic 350 (Intangibles Goodwill and Other).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	ASU 2012-02 provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions are met.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 (early adoption is permitted).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P75_S3	The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	The valuation methods used by the Company for each significant class of investments are summarized below.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions Valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Common stocks Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Available for sale securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	During 2012, the Company determined the inputs used to value its investments in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and obligations of state and political subdivisions were based on observable market information consistent with Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, rather than Level 1 as reported in the 2011 financial statements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Accordingly, the amounts shown in the 2011 table above have been revised to reflect the correct presentation.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the period, a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately for each major category of assets, is required.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	There were no such assets or liabilities held during 2012.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	A reconciliation for 2011 is as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities at December 29, 2012:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2011:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	The unrealized losses and unrealized gains on the Company s investments in 2012 and 2011 were caused primarily by changes in interest rates and credit spreads.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	During 2012 and 2011, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 29, 2012, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $17,470, $14,277, and $11,768 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank, securing payment of the United Kingdom value-added tax requirements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $836 and $771 at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $186,883 over the next five years.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P99_S2	In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P99_S3	During the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, expense related to these plans of $22,159, $20,647, and $17,952, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P100_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, were significant.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the redomestication effective June 27, 2010 (see Note 12), is 7.83%.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2012, as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $170,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $31,000.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P103_S2	For 2011, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $159,000 lower, or $45,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $11,000.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P103_S3	For 2010, the amounts related to tax at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% prior to the redomestication and the Swiss statutory rate of 7.83%, subsequent to the redomestication, would be approximately $96,000 lower, or $106,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately ($20,000).
1121788_13_ITEM8_P103_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $495,908, $473,994, and $413,550, for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $0.03, $0.07, and $0.07 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P104_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2016, at which time these tax benefits might expire.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company recognized a $29,615 deferred tax asset during 2010 for the future tax benefit of the fair market value step-up in basis of intangible assets related to the redomestication to Switzerland and local statutory tax reporting requirements.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	The deferred tax asset was recognized as an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital in 2010 and will reverse as the intangible assets are amortized for Swiss statutory and tax reporting purposes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	At December 29, 2012, the Company had $46,577 of tax credit carryover which includes $41,553 of Taiwan surtax credit with no expiration.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	There is a full valuation allowance for the Taiwan surtax credits.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P107_S2	The valuation allowance reflects a net increase of $14,220 during 2012 including $10,314 related to Taiwan surtax credits.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P107_S3	The valuation allowance decreased in 2011 by $14,179 of which $14,994 related to surtax credits in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	At December 29, 2012, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $15,771 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $73,298.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $11,990 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2025, $24,604 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2018, $2,218 related to China that expires in 2017 and $34,486 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P109_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	Beginning in 2011, for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating segments auto/mobile, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P112_S2	Prior to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of those products, their production processes, the types of customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic conditions.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P112_S3	Management re-evaluated the combination of these operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics of these segments they should now be reported as two distinct reportable segments.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEM s.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company s marine, auto/mobile, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P114_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P116_S1	The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income before income taxes of each segment.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	Revenues, interest income and interest expense, and income before income taxes for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	Net sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010.

1121788_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 29, 2012 is 4.05 and 3.92 years, respectively.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P129_S1	The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 29, 2012 was 1.85 years.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2012, 2011, and 2010:
1121788_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.

1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Garmin s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin s engineering and manufacturing teams.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	Garmin s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 3,168 people worldwide as of December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	Garmin s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S3	Garmin s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S4	Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin s success.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P94_S5	Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	Below is a table of Garmin s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	Garmin believes that one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its Sijhih, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than a few select marine products (VHF radios and AIS receivers) and our accessory products, which are manufactured by one or more third parties.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, improved quality and yields, lower cost and better value for customers.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	Garmin s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and rugged.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Operating our own manufacturing and distribution facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	Operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows Garmin to quickly adjust the mix of product production, helping to foster faster delivery response to the customer.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	Garmin s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Garmin s automotive operations in Taiwan and Olathe have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	In addition, Garmin s aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	This certification recognizes that Garmin s subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components, including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and certain application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P105_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P105_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P105_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P105_S4	Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin s requirements.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the Father s Day/graduation buying season.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P109_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P109_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	As of February 1, 2014, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 820 patent and 470 trademark registrations issued worldwide.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	For the past seven years Garmin has been selected as a constituent of the Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P110_S3	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P113_S1	In accordance with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P113_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P113_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P113_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P114_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P114_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P114_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P116_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P116_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P117_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P117_S2	Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P120_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facility.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	Regulatory and Green Procurement demands from our customers are also increasing; particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	As of December 28, 2013, Garmin had 10,086 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,804 were in the United States, 75 were in Canada, 4,687 were in Taiwan, 1,117 were in Europe, and 403 were in other global locations.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P123_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	From 2005 to 2008, we experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This has resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Mobile handsets and tablets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduced margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our financial results are dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 50% of our revenues, is maturing and expected to further decline in 2014.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This market has peaked as penetration rates increased and competing technologies emerged.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in Swiss, United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	and Tele Atlas N.V. HERE is owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and HERE in June 2010 (extending our HERE license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with HERE changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We may have additional tax liabilities.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are subject to income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P61_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S6	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P63_S7	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S6	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P65_S7	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P69_S4	The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The shutdown of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Any future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration operations would harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Any failure of Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	GPS is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	For example, the FCC has been considering a proposal by a private party, LightSquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If the FCC were to permit implementation of LightSquared s proposal, terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P97_S2	It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	During 2013, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.60 to a high of $49.33.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	As of January 13, 2014, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.30% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P106_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P108_S2	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P108_S4	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	There are currently legislative projects pending in Swiss Parliament and the Swiss federal administration that depending on their final form may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P109_S2	If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P110_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P110_S2	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P110_S3	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_14_ITEM1A_P111_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are the principal properties owned or leased by the Company and its subsidiaries:
1121788_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. occupy a facility of approximately 1,120,000 square feet on 42 acres in Olathe, Kansas, where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured and products are warehoused, distributed, and supported for North, Central and South America.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Garmin s subsidiary, Garmin Realty, LLC also owns an additional 46 acres of land on the Olathe site for future expansion.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	In connection with the bond financings for the facility in Olathe and the previous expansion of that facility, the City of Olathe holds the legal title to the Olathe facility which is leased to Garmin s subsidiaries by the City.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the payment in full of the outstanding bonds, the City of Olathe is obligated to transfer title to Garmin s subsidiaries for the aggregate sum of $200.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P1_S4	Garmin International, Inc. has purchased all the outstanding bonds and continues to hold the bonds until maturity in order to benefit from property tax abatement.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	Garmin Corporation owns and occupies a 249,326 square foot facility in Sijhih, Taipei County, Taiwan, a 223,469 square foot facility in Jhongli, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan, and an approximately 580,000 square foot facility in LinKou, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	In these three facilities, Garmin Corporation manufactures all of Garmin s consumer and portable aviation products and warehouses, markets and supports products for the Pacific Rim countries.
1121788_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Garmin AT, Inc. leases approximately 18 acres of land in Salem, Oregon under a ground lease.

1121788_14_ITEM3_P34_S0	Visteon Global Technologies, Inc. and Visteon Technologies LLC v. Garmin International, Inc.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P35_S0	No 6,097,316 ( the 316 patent ).
1121788_14_ITEM3_P36_S0	On May 17, 2010, Garmin filed its answer asserting that each claim of the 060 patent, the 892 patent, the 408 patent and the 375 patent is invalid and/or not infringed.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P37_S0	On April 12, 2011, the special master appointed by the court held a claim construction hearing.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P37_S1	On December 12, 2011, the court issued an order adopting the special master s report construing the claims of the patents-in-suit.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P38_S0	On September 14, 2012, Garmin filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office petitions for ex parte reexamination of the 408 patent and the 060 patent as being anticipated and obvious in view of the prior art.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P38_S1	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office subsequently granted Garmin s requests for ex parte reexaminations and initially rejected all identified claims.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P38_S2	On April 15, 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of the challenged claims of the 060 patent.

1121788_14_ITEM3_P39_S2	On February 4, 2013, the summary judgment motions were referred to the special master for consideration.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P40_S0	Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P41_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement, other intellectual property, product liability, customer claims and various other risks.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P41_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_14_ITEM3_P41_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

1121788_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Garmin s common shares have traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol GRMN since its initial public offering on December 8, 2000 (the IPO ).
1121788_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of January 24, 2014, there were 216 shareholders of record.
1121788_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The high and low sales prices of Garmin s common shares as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market for each fiscal quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was as follows:
1121788_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	On June 7, 2013 the shareholders approved a cash dividend in the amount of $1.80 per share out of Garmin s general reserves from capital contribution payable in four equal installments.

1121788_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	We refer you to Item 12 of this report under the caption Equity Compensation Plan Information for certain equity plan information required to be disclosed by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K.

The selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009 and the selected consolidated statement of income data for the years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 were derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, not included herein.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations and should be read together with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Items 7 and 8 in Part II of this Form 10-K.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	Our fiscal year-end is the last Saturday of the calendar year and does not always fall on December 31.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	All years presented contain 52 weeks excluding Fiscal 2011 which includes 53 weeks.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	Includes a change in estimate for per unit revenue and cost deferrals.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	The increase to net sales, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share and diluted net income per share was $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	Includes $35.5 million foreign currency gain in 2013 and $20.0 million, $12.1 million, $88.4 million, and $6.0 million foreign currency losses in 2012, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively.

1121788_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

1121788_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects, anticipates, believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Garmin s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2013 and 2012 contained 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks for 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company s fiscal year and fiscal periods.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Approximately 77% of sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We experienced $35.5 million in foreign currency gains during fiscal year 2013 and ($20.0) million and ($12.1) million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or premium traffic service.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The second and potentially third deliverables are the LMU and/or premium traffic service.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU and/or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Concurrently, market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The impact in 2011 of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We sell our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer s financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	We determine these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Beginning in 2011, the Company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	On March 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the Agreement ) with Bombardier, Inc. ( Bombardier ).
1121788_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft currently in development for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Bombardier (the Program ).
1121788_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013 and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Bombardier will repay the loan in five installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent amendment signed December 6, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	As of December 28, 2013, the Company had a loan receivable balance of $137,369 from Bombardier, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P29_S5	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Investment income is recorded when earned, and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	It is Garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin s compensation package for employees.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Certain employees within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected life, forfeitures and dividends.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	In 2013, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 40 basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues partially offset by a positive impact to 2012 gross margin from a one-time royalty fee adjustment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on gross profit deferrals.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	In 2012, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues, the third quarter 2011 change in estimate of per unit revenue and cost deferred as previously discussed and a one-time royalty fee adjustment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	In 2011, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 280 basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products, partially offset by the change in estimate mentioned above, and decreased selling prices on comparable units, as well as positive impact to 2010 gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2013, we experienced an 860 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013, competitive pricing dynamics on new products and product mix.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2012, we experienced a 320 and 260 basis point increase in aviation and fitness gross margins, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Aviation gross margin expansion was driven primarily by product mix and a OEM program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins in 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Fitness gross margin improvement was due to product mix.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	In 2011, we experienced a 420 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	Gross margins for the aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness segments are typically more stable than in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P43_S6	Our long-term gross margin targets are 70%, 55%, 60%, and 60%, respectively, for these segments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Sijhih, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	In both 2013 and 2012, we reduced our advertising expense due primarily to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	In 2011, our advertising costs increased slightly as we again experienced revenue growth.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	We expect advertising costs to increase slightly in 2014 with incremental spending associated with new product categories partially offset by decreased spending in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2013 after increasing in both 2012 and 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The 2013 decrease was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements and related fees.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	The 2012 increase was primarily driven by full year expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011 and legal costs.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	The 2011 increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, commissions associated with a new web-based sales program, bad debt expense, legal costs and product support costs.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to increase slightly in 2014 and remain consistent as a percentage of net sales.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Approximately 81% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	We expect our research and development budget to increase in 2014 due to our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our top ten customers have contributed between 24% and 29% of net sales since 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 69 and 72 days since 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	We expect the level of customer accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in 2014.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 6.3% during 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	This is a decrease from an effective rate of 13.1% in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The significant decline was due to the impact of a $68.7 million benefit, which includes the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2009 offset by Taiwan surtax expense due to this reserve release.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Excluding these items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 16.8% for fiscal year 2013 compared to 13.1% for fiscal year 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	This increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable income mix across tax jurisdictions, reduced Taiwanese tax incentives, and the release of other uncertain tax position reserves, amounting to approximately $11.2 million for 2013 and $13.0 million for 2012 that are considered immaterial, tend to be more recurring in nature and are comparable between periods.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	These factors were partially offset by the impact of $6.3 million of research and development tax credits related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in January 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Management believes that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 will be consistent with the 2013 effective tax rate of 16.8%, excluding special items as outlined above, as operating profits and margins are relatively stable.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The actual effective tax rate will depend upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2014, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net sales decreased 3% in 2013 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease was driven by the automotive/mobile segment which posted a 13% decline with offsetting growth in outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 49% in 2013, compared to 55% in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Total unit sales decreased 10% to 13.9 million units in 2013 from 15.4 million units in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in unit sales volume was attributable to reduced automotive/mobile volumes due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	This decline was partially offset by growth in each of the other segments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue decreased 13% from the year-ago period, as volumes decreased 17% partially offset by average selling price (ASP) improvement due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current year revenue deferrals in 2013 and increased auto OEM contribution with a higher ASP.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Aviation revenues increased 16% from the year-ago period as the OEM market improved in some aircraft categories, as well as contribution from recent share gains and aftermarket products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Fitness revenues increased 11% on the strength of our cycling products, power meter, and the Forerunner 10 with strong volume growth partially offset by reduced ASPs associated with the Forerunner 10.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Revenues in our marine segment increased 7% as new product introductions were partially offset by a weak first quarter when we discounted many products in advance of new products and a global marine electronics industry that continues to be weak due to macroeconomic instability.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company anticipates revenue of $2.6 - $2.7 billion in 2014 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 4% when compared to the year ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased 50 basis points from the year ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenue for outdoor and fitness were negatively impacted by product mix and slight ASP declines.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenues increased by 850 basis points in marine due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013, competitive pricing dynamics on new products and rising component costs.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	The automotive/mobile segment recorded a 13% decline in cost of goods in absolute dollars as revenues declined 13%.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S5	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenues for the automotive/mobile segment decreased by 30 basis points as the effect of a $21 million one-time royalty fee benefit related to license fee overpayments recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by the benefit from the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenue and the associated costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P62_S6	The aviation segment experienced an absolute dollar cost of goods sold increase generally commensurate with the sales increase discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively stable in 2014 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average, product mix within those segments and current component pricing.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2013 decreased 2% while gross profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012 driven primarily by the automotive/mobile and aviation segments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The automotive/mobile gross margin was stable at 43% as the royalty benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by increased amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues in 2013, as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The gross profit margin percentage for the marine segment declined by 850 basis points as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively stable in 2014 as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Advertising expense decreased 19% in absolute dollars and 80 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The decrease occurred primarily in the automotive/mobile and marine segments due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in automotive/mobile and a newer product line in marine requiring less promotional activity.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Management expects to increase advertising as a percentage of sales in 2014 with incremental spending associated with new product categories partially offset by decreased spending in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 4% in absolute dollars and 10 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The absolute dollar decrease is primarily related to reduced legal settlements and legal fees in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The increase in aviation is partially related to an increase in bad debt expense.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable as a percentage of sales in 2014.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Research and development expense increased 12% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $39.2 million when compared with 2012 representing a 190 basis point increase as a percent of revenue.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	Aviation had the largest increase in absolute dollars as we are investing heavily in OEM opportunities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	Marine and automotive/mobile investment is focused on marine product enhancements and automotive OEM opportunities, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Within outdoor and fitness, we launched a number of new product categories in 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	We are also exploring new categories within these segments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2014 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Operating income decreased 5% in absolute dollars and 40 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to 2012 due to declining revenues and increased research and development expense offset by a slight improvement in gross margins and cost reductions in advertising and selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2013 increased slightly due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	As these entities have grown, currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P78_S5	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The majority of the $35.5 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	The weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and British Pound Sterling contributed additional gains.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	During 2013, the U.S. Dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P79_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the Company.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	The $20.0 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	During 2012, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $31.3 million.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	This was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a $10.4 million gain.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $0.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our earnings before taxes increased 5% when compared to 2012, while our income tax expense decreased by $41.0 million, to $41.1 million for 2013, compared to $82.1 million for 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The significant decline was due to the impact of a $68.7 million benefit, which includes the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2009 offset by Taiwan surtax expense due to this reserve release.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	Excluding these items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 16.8% for fiscal year 2013 compared to 13.1% for fiscal year 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	This increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable income mix across tax jurisdictions, reduced Taiwanese tax incentives, and the release of other uncertain tax position reserves, amounting to approximately $11.2 million for 2013 and $13.0 million for 2012 that are considered immaterial, tend to be more recurring in nature and are comparable between periods.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	These factors were partially offset by the impact of $6.3 million of research and development tax credits related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in January 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 13% to $612.4 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $542.4 million for fiscal year 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Net sales decreased 2% in 2012 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	The decrease was driven by automotive/mobile and marine with offsetting growth in outdoor, fitness and aviation.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	The outdoor segment experienced the greatest increase at 11% with fitness contributing 8% growth.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 58% in 2011 to 55% in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Total unit sales decreased 3% to 15.4 million units in 2012 from 15.8 million units in 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	The declining unit sales volume in 2012 was primarily attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American and European PND markets slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	This decline was partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor and fitness segments, as well as auto OEM units.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 6% in 2012, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 6%.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	ASP was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services, as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $68.3 million of net sales in 2012 compared to $179.3 million of net sales in 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	The reduced impact of deferred revenue is related to increased amortization of previously deferred revenues and costs and a reduced per unit revenue deferral rate due to a change in accounting estimate in the third quarter of 2011, as previously discussed, offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Outdoor revenue increased 11% driven by market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category and the dog tracking and training portfolio including the benefit of an acquisition completed in the second half of 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Fitness segment revenue increased 8% on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration though slowing from 24% growth in the prior year when we had significant promotional activity on discontinued products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Marine revenues decreased 6% due to a difficult international marine environment.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	Aviation revenues increased 2% as the Company s OEM business began to recover but was partially offset by declining sales of retrofit and portable products.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 10% in 2012 when compared to the year-ago period primarily due to unit volume declines discussed above, component cost reductions, a mix shift toward higher margin new products and certain factors specific to the automotive/mobile segment discussed below.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the automotive/mobile segment decreased by 560 basis points.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	The decline principally resulted from a $21 million one-time royalty fee benefit recorded in second quarter (140 basis points) and subsequent impact of reduced royalty costs, a reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and costs including the reduced per unit deferral rate as discussed above (280 basis points), component price reductions and product mix shifting toward more recently introduced products carrying a higher margin profile.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Fitness and marine posted declines in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due to product mix moving toward newer products with increased features, functionality and higher per unit margins, as well as decreased promotional activities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Aviation posted a decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due primarily to product mix and a prior year OEM contribution that negatively impacted revenues.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2012 increased 7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 450 basis points compared to 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Gross profit margins increased in all segments, excluding outdoor, when compared to 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the one-time royalty fee adjustment, a $90 million reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and cost including the reduced per unit deferral rate partially offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral, reduced component pricing and improved product mix, as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Fitness and marine gross profit margin percentage increased 260 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily by product mix improvement and less promotional activity in the current year, as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Aviation gross profit margin percentage increased 320 basis points driven primarily by product mix and a prior year OEM contribution, as discussed above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Advertising expense decreased in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	The decrease in absolute dollars resulted from reduced cooperative advertising on lower sales in the PND category partially offset by increased cooperative advertising and media placement within the outdoor, fitness and marine segments.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 120 basis points in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	The expense increase was primarily driven by full year expense for acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011, which added almost $20 million, and increased legal costs and reserves partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense and commissions expense.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Research and development expense increased 9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 375 new engineering personnel with an emphasis on OEM opportunities within aviation, auto and marine.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $27.2 million when compared with the year-ago period and increased 120 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Operating income increased 210 basis points as a percent of revenue and 9% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin improvement was only partially offset by increased operating expenses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2012 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year offset by a slight decline in interest rates.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	The $20.0 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	During 2012, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $31.3 million.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	This was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a $10.4 million gain.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	The remaining net currency gain of $0.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	The $12.1 million currency loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our earnings before taxes increased 7% when compared to 2011 while our income tax expense increased by 30% to $82.1 million, compared to $63.3 million for fiscal year 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	The significant increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the income eligible for tax holiday in Taiwan, unfavorable income mix toward higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, net of amounts released due to expiration of statutes of limitations, and the impact of no research and development credit in 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 4% to $542.4 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $520.9 million for fiscal year 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The $54.7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	The $137.6 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	We expect to generate $550 - $600 million of cash flow from operations in 2014 with ongoing net income.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	The $221.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	The $8.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	We have budgeted approximately $50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P108_S3	Garmin s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 were approximately 1.4%, 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	In 2013, Garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $57,356 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and $4,377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013 were $1,215,498 and $1,153,765, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	This decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S3	The decline was due to increases in the 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S4	Approximately 50% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S5	An immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S6	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S7	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P110_S8	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	The $157.0 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	The $57.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Our dividend has progressively increased from $0.40 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2011 to $0.45 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2012 through December 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 28, 2013, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The Company is a party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $225.6 million over the next five years.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $133.0 million as of December 28, 2013, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S3	In 2013, the U.S. Dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S4	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P7_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $43.6 million at the end of fiscal 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	In 2013, Garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $57,356 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and $4,377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013 were $1,215,498 and $1,153,765, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S2	This decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S3	The decline was due to increases in the 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S4	Approximately 50% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S5	An immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S6	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S7	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_14_ITEM7A_P11_S8	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and management.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related products.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P5_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	Fiscal years 2013 and 2012 included 52 weeks while fiscal year 2011 included 53 weeks.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of $ 85,363 and $ 128,972 as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange gains/(losses) of $ 35,538 , ($ 20,022 ), and ($ 12,100 ) for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	The gain in fiscal 2013 was due primarily to the strengthening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	The loss in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P11_S5	The loss in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of the slight strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the slight weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P14_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Beginning in 2011, the Company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	On March 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the Agreement ) with Bombardier, Inc. ( Bombardier ).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft currently in development for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Bombardier (the Program ).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $ 173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013 and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	Bombardier will repay the loan in five installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent amendment signed December 6, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P17_S3	As of December 28, 2013, the Company had a loan receivable balance of $ 137,369 from Bombardier, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2013, 2012, or 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P22_S3	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	On June 7, 2013, the shareholders approved a dividend of $ 1.80 per share (of which, $ 0.90 was paid in the Company's 2013 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company paid dividends in 2013 in the amount of $ 351,707 .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	On June 1, 2012, the shareholders approved a dividend of $ 1.80 per share (of which, $ 0.90 was paid in the Company's 2012 fiscal year) payable in four installments as follows: $ 0.45 on June 29, 2012 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2012, $ 0.45 on September 28, 2012 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2012, $ 0.45 on December 31, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 14, 2012 and $ 0.45 on March 29, 2013 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company paid dividends in 2012 in the amount of $ 253,386 .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	On June 3, 2011, the shareholders approved a dividend of $ 2.00 per share (of which, $ 1.60 was paid in the Company's 2011 fiscal year) payable in four installments as follows: $ 0.80 on June 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2011, $ 0.40 on September 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2011, $ 0.40 on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 15, 2011 and $ 0.40 on March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2012.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	The dividends were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Approximately $ 265,880 and $ 254,986 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $ 183,431 and $ 181,918 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Accumulated amortization was $ 143,227 and $ 125,380 at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $ 17,847 , $ 21,437 , and $ 24,831 for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $ 16,085 , $ 8,326 , $ 6,115 , $ 2,848 , and $ 2,234 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $ 179,290 at December 28, 2013 and $ 176,059 at December 29, 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	The decrease in net identifiable intangible assets is principally related to amortization, partially offset by acquisitions completed in 2013 and other purchases of intangible assets.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of ($ 47,322 ) and $ 9,582 , respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 24 % and 29 % of net sales since 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10 % of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Beginning in 2011, the Company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or premium traffic service.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	The second deliverable and potentially third deliverables are the LMU and/or premium traffic service.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P50_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	The estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	During 2011, sales of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Concurrently, market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	Due to these changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The impact in 2011 of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue, gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $ 77.8 million, $ 66.5 million, $ 59.3 million, $ 0.31 , and $ 0.30 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P55_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $ 427,920 and $ 445,422 , respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $ 98,525 and $ 96,307 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	In the next three years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $ 199,540 , $ 98,671 and $ 31,184 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P60_S5	The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Our expected future cost is estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns and the related warranty costs incurred.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	In 2013 we updated these assumptions and shortened the estimated time horizon in which we settle claims with our retail partners.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Minor changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties are aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the accrual for products sold line .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P63_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $ 112,905 , $ 138,757 , and $ 145,024 for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $ 364,923 , $ 325,773 , and $ 298,584 for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02 Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), which is included in ASC Topic 350 (Intangibles Goodwill and Other).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	ASU 2012-02 provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions are met.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02), which is included in ASC Topic 220 (Comprehensive Income).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	The objective of ASU 2013-02 is to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	The amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	The Company has implemented this amendment and has included the required disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11 Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11), which is included in ASC Topic 740 (Income Taxes).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	ASU 2013-11 requires an entity to net its liability for unrecognized tax positions against a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The provisions of this new guidance are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our financial statements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	The valuation methods used by the Company for each significant class of investments are summarized below.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	Mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions Valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Common stocks Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	Available for sale securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Represents impairment not related to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	Represents unrealized losses on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in "Other income" and the noncredit component in "Other comprehensive income (loss)" for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P86_S3	During 2013 and 2012, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	In 2013, Garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $ 57,356 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and $4,377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013 were $ 1,215,498 and $ 1,153,765 , respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	This decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S3	The decline was due to increases in the 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S4	Approximately 50 % of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S5	An immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S6	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S7	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P88_S8	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 28, 2013, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $ 18,721 , $ 17,470 , and $ 14,277 for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank, securing payment of the United Kingdom value-added tax requirements.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $ 249 and $ 836 at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $ 225,604 over the next five years.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement, other intellectual property, product liability, customer claims and various other risks.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P96_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P97_S3	During the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, expense related to these plans of $26,839, $22,159, and $20,647, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P98_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, were significant.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the redomestication effective June 27, 2010 (see Note 12), is 7.83 %.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2013, as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be $ 178,000 lower, or $ 51,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $ 64,000 .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	For 2012, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $ 170,000 lower, or $ 49,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $ 31,000 .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	For 2011, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $ 159,000 lower, or $ 45,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $ 11,000 .
1121788_14_ITEM8_P101_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $ 502,423 , $ 495,908 , and $ 473,994 , for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $ 0.03 , $ 0.03 , and $ 0.07 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2016, at which time these tax benefits will likely expire.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P102_S3	Income taxes of $ 307,990 , $ 252,452 , and $ 229,657 at December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	This reclassification if recorded in the balance sheet for the period ended December 29, 2012 would result in an increase to noncurrent income taxes payable of $ 13,882 , the same amount reflected as an increase to the noncurrent deferred tax asset in this schedule.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	The December 28, 2013 balance of $125,918 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P112_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P115_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	On September 13, 2013, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property.

1121788_14_ITEM8_P119_S2	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.

1121788_15_ITEM1_P107_S5	Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	Below is a table of Garmin s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	Garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli and LinKou, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	Garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Specifically, Garmin believes that its vertical integration of it manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality and time to market.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	Cost: Garmin s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency, resulting in lower cost.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	Garmin s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high, mid and low volume products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P111_S2	Sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects Garmin s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P111_S3	The ownership and integration of our resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products, yielding improved cost.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	Quality: Garmin s automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P113_S1	This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	Garmin s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	Garmin s automotive operations in Taiwan and Olathe have achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P114_S2	Garmin s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P116_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P118_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P118_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P118_S4	Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin s requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	Our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P119_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the Mother s Day/Father s Day/graduation buying season.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P119_S2	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P119_S3	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P120_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P120_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P121_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	As of January 19, 2015, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 880 patent and 610 trademark registrations issued worldwide.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P122_S1	For the past seven years Garmin has been selected as a constituent of the Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P122_S2	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P122_S3	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P123_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P124_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P125_S1	In accordance with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P125_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P125_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P125_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P126_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P126_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P126_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P127_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P128_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P128_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P132_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan manufacturing facility.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	Regulatory and Green Procurement demands from our customers are also increasing; particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	As of December 27, 2014, Garmin had 11,185 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 4,177 were in the United States, 80 were in Canada, 5,276 were in Taiwan, 1,168 were in Europe, and 484 were in other global locations.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P136_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	GPS/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial results are dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 43% of our revenues, and is expected to decline in 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of certain components.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in Swiss, United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We have a technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S5	It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P53_S6	A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are HERE (formerly known as NAVTEQ) and TomTom N.V. HERE is owned by Nokia Oyj and TomTom N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and HERE in February 2015 extending our HERE license agreement through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with HERE changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may have additional income tax liabilities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are subject to income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S6	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P61_S7	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S4	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S6	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P63_S7	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P65_S4	If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Sales of certain of our fitness, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P69_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration operations would harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Any failure of Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P80_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	GPS is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	A shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business .
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	During 2014, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $43.63 to a high of $61.69.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	As of January 25, 2015, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.62% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P103_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P105_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P107_S2	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P107_S3	Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P107_S4	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	There are currently legislative projects pending in Swiss Parliament and the Swiss federal administration that depending on their final form may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P108_S2	If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P109_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P109_S2	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P109_S3	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_15_ITEM1A_P110_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.

( Garmin ), Trimble Navigation Ltd. ( Trimble ), The U.S. GPS Industry Council (the Council ), and the Coalition to Save Our GPS.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P7_S1	The Coalition to Save Our GPS is no longer a defendant.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P7_S2	Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on August 16, 2013, a second amended complaint on January 21, 2014, and a third amended complaint on March 18, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P7_S3	The third amended complaint seeks damages of at least $1.9 billion based on allegations of violation of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ), violation of Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, equitable estoppel, breach of contract, and violation of Section 349 of the New York General Business Law.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P8_S0	Plaintiffs allege that they invested in a company now called LightSquared in the belief that LightSquared would be able to operate a new terrestrial, mobile telecommunications network (the Terrestrial Plan ) on certain satellite radio frequencies.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P8_S1	Plaintiffs also allege that LightSquared was not able to obtain approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate the proposed Terrestrial Plan because of interference it would cause to Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers operating in an adjacent frequency band.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P8_S2	Plaintiffs further allege that defendants concealed the likelihood of such interference and breached an earlier alleged agreement with a predecessor of LightSquared regarding a different technical issue.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P8_S3	Plaintiffs allege they were third-party beneficiaries of the agreement.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P9_S0	On November 1, 2013, LightSquared, Inc. and two related entities (collectively, LightSquared ) filed an adversary proceeding (the LightSquared Lawsuit ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (where a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code filed by LightSquared and certain related entities is pending) against Deere, Garmin, Trimble, the Council, and the Coalition to Save Our GPS.

1121788_15_ITEM3_P10_S0	Like the allegations in the Harbinger Lawsuit, LightSquared alleges that it was not able to obtain approval from the FCC to operate its proposed Terrestrial Plan because of interference it would cause to GPS receivers.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P10_S1	LightSquared also alleges that the inability to obtain FCC approval caused LightSquared damages, including the loss of third-party contracts.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P10_S2	LightSquared further alleges that defendants concealed the likelihood of such interference and/or represented to LightSquared that any interference issues had been resolved and that defendants breached earlier alleged agreements with LightSquared regarding a different technical issue.
1121788_15_ITEM3_P11_S0	On November 15, 2013, Garmin, Deere, Trimble, and the Council filed a motion to withdraw the reference of the LightSquared adversary proceeding from the Bankruptcy Court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court ).

1121788_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to we, us, our and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	For information on each of the following critical accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	In recent years, pricing has stabilized in automotive/mobile allowing for stable to improving gross margins.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	In 2014, fitness pricing declined due to high volumes of lower-priced activity trackers.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Approximately 82% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Net sales increased 9% in 2014 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	All segments, excluding automotive/mobile, grew in the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 43% in the fiscal year 2014 compared to 49% in the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Total unit sales increased 9% to 15.1 million units in 2014 from 13.9 million units in 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to growth in all segments except automotive/mobile which had volume decline due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue decreased 5% from fiscal year 2013, as a 10% volume decline and slight average selling price (ASP) decline, were partially offset by amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current period revenue deferrals and increased auto OEM contributions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Revenues in our fitness segment increased 60% from fiscal year 2013 on the strength of wellness products first introduced in 2014, and recent biking and running product introductions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Aviation revenues increased 14% from fiscal year 2013 as both OEM market share gains and aftermarket strength contributed to growth.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Outdoor revenues increased 4% from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to strong sales of f nix 2 and our lineup of dog tracking and training products, offset by declining sales of our handheld products which serve a mature industry.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	Revenues in our marine segment increased 11% due to both the recent acquisition of Fusion Electronics as well as new product introductions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P23_S5	This growth was partially offset by a competitive pricing environment in the global marine electronics industry.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company anticipates revenue of $2.9 billion in 2015 driven by growth in the fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 3% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increase was driven by growth in all segments excluding automotive/mobile.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Fitness and marine cost of goods increased in-line with sales growth as described above with gross margins stable year-over-year.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Outdoor cost of goods increased due to sales growth with gross margin contraction driven by product mix.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased 240 basis points from fiscal year 2013 with improvement or stability in each segment, excluding outdoor as mentioned above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The automotive/mobile cost of goods improvement as a percent of revenues was primarily due to benefit from the amortization of previously deferred revenue and costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased contribution of software sales which carry a higher margin.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively stable in 2015 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average, product mix within those segments and current component pricing.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2014 increased 14% while gross profit margin increased 240 basis points compared to fiscal year 2013 with all segments stable or improving, excluding outdoor.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The automotive/mobile, fitness, marine and aviation segments recorded improved gross margins, as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Outdoor gross profit margins declined, as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively stable in 2015 as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Advertising expense increased 30% in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in absolute dollars occurred primarily in outdoor and fitness to support new product introductions and was partially offset by decreased spending in automotive/mobile due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Aviation advertising increased materially due to increased cooperative advertising efforts with our dealers.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Management expects to decrease advertising as a percentage of sales in 2015 due to continued benefit from the 2014 advertising increase.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 5% in absolute dollars and declined 50 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The absolute dollar increase is primarily related to product support, information technology costs and legal costs specific to marine litigation.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The aviation increase was primarily driven by product support costs.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Other variances by segment, excluding aviation, are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase slightly as a percentage of sales in 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $30.2 million when compared with fiscal year 2013 and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	Fitness, outdoor and aviation increased to support new product initiatives.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Automotive/mobile investment declined due to efforts to allocate research and development spending to areas with the highest growth potential.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2015 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	As a result of the above, operating income increased 20% in absolute dollars and 220 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Revenue growth and an improving gross margin percentage, as discussed above, contributed to the growth.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	By segment results are discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2014 and 2013 were 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The slight increase in interest income was offset by fewer capital gains on investments in 2014, which is recorded as Other income.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	As these entities have grown, currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The majority of the $4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting in a net loss of $43.7 million.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	This was more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $44.8 million.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The majority of the $35.5 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and British Pound Sterling contributed additional gains.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	During 2013, the U.S. Dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the Company.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our income tax expense increased by $318.4 million, to $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014, from $41.1 million for the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Contributing to the significant increase were:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	research and development tax credits of $6.3 million related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in January 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Partially offset by favorable impacts including:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax audits of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014 compared to releases of $79.9 million in fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307,635.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	The first cash tax payment of $78,137 associated with the restructuring was made in the third quarter of 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	We anticipate paying approximately $185,000 in the second quarter of 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P52_S5	The remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company expects the effective income tax rate to be between 16-17% in 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 41% to $364.2 million for the fiscal year 2014 compared to $612.4 million for fiscal year 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net sales decreased 3% in 2013 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The decrease was driven by the automotive/mobile segment which posted a 13% decline with offsetting growth in outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 49% in 2013, compared to 55% in 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Total unit sales decreased 10% to 13.9 million units in 2013 from 15.4 million units in 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in unit sales volume was attributable to reduced automotive/mobile volumes due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	This decline was partially offset by growth in each of the other segments.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Automotive/mobile segment revenue decreased 13% from the year-ago period, as volumes decreased 17% partially offset by average selling price (ASP) improvement due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current year revenue deferrals in 2013 and increased auto OEM contribution with a higher ASP.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Aviation revenues increased 16% from the year-ago period as the OEM market improved in some aircraft categories, as well as contribution from recent share gains and aftermarket products.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Fitness revenues increased 11% on the strength of our cycling products, power meter, and the Forerunner 10 with strong volume growth partially offset by reduced ASPs associated with the Forerunner 10.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Revenues in our marine segment increased 7% as new product introductions were partially offset by a weak first quarter when we discounted many products in advance of new products and a global marine electronics industry that continues to be weak due to macroeconomic instability.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 4% when compared to the year ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased 50 basis points from the year ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenue for outdoor and fitness were negatively impacted by product mix and slight ASP declines.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenues increased by 850 basis points in marine due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013, competitive pricing dynamics on new products and rising component costs.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	The automotive/mobile segment recorded a 13% decline in cost of goods in absolute dollars as revenues declined 13%.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S5	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenues for the automotive/mobile segment decreased by 30 basis points as the effect of a $21 million one-time royalty fee benefit related to license fee overpayments recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by the benefit from the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenue and the associated costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P59_S6	The aviation segment experienced an absolute dollar cost of goods sold increase generally commensurate with the sales increase discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Gross profit dollars in 2013 decreased 2% while gross profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012 driven primarily by the automotive/mobile and aviation segments.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The automotive/mobile gross margin was stable at 43% as the royalty benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by increased amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues in 2013, as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The gross profit margin percentage for the marine segment declined by 850 basis points as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Advertising expense decreased 19% in absolute dollars and 80 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease occurred primarily in the automotive/mobile and marine segments due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in automotive/mobile and a newer product line in marine requiring less promotional activity.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 4% in absolute dollars and 10 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The absolute dollar decrease is primarily related to reduced legal settlements and legal fees in the automotive/mobile segment.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The increase in aviation is partially related to an increase in bad debt expense.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Research and development expense increased 12% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $39.2 million when compared with 2012 representing a 190 basis point increase as a percent of revenue.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Aviation had the largest increase in absolute dollars as we are investing heavily in OEM opportunities.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Marine and automotive/mobile investment is focused on marine product enhancements and automotive OEM opportunities, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Within outdoor and fitness, we launched a number of new product categories in 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	We are also exploring new categories within these segments.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Operating income decreased 5% in absolute dollars and 40 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to 2012 due to declining revenues and increased research and development expense offset by a slight improvement in gross margins and cost reductions in advertising and selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Interest income for fiscal 2013 increased slightly due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The majority of the $35.5 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and British Pound Sterling contributed additional gains.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	During 2013, the U.S. Dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S4	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P69_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the Company.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The $20.0 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	During 2012, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $31.3 million.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	This was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a $10.4 million gain.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	The remaining net currency gain of $0.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our income tax expense decreased by $41.0 million, to $41.1 million for the fiscal year 2013, from $82.1 million for the fiscal year 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Contributing to the significant decrease were:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Partially offset by unfavorable impacts including:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	expiration of certain Taiwan tax holidays.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 13% to $612.4 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $542.4 million for fiscal year 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	The $107.4 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	the impact of deferred income taxes providing $81.9 million more cash due primarily to timing of disbursements partially related to the inter-company restructuring in addition to the reclassification of withholding taxes from current taxes payable.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The $54.7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	We expect to generate $610 million of cash flow from operations in 2015 with ongoing net income.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The $405.8 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The $221.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	We have budgeted approximately $85 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	Garmin s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 were approximately 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.4%, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	In 2013, Garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $57,356 and $4,377 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 28, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013 were $1,215,498 and $1,153,765, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	This decrease in estimated fair value was primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	The decline was due to increases in the 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield decreased in 2014, resulting in a balance of $13,031 and $8,420 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 27, 2014 were $1,276,404 and $1,254,953, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Approximately 59% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P84_S5	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The $192.8 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The $157.0 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our dividend has progressively increased from $0.40 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2011 to $0.45 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in June 2012 to $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 27, 2014, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company is a party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $268.1 million over the next five years.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $77.5 million as of December 27, 2014, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S3	In 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% and 5.5%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency loss of $43.7 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $44.8 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P8_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $5.4 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $4.3 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $64.5 million during the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Based on total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 27, 2014, a hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse change of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $118 million at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P13_S2	During 2014 and 2013, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company s portfolio of marketable securities.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Based on balance sheet positions as of December 27, 2014, a hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in an approximate $52 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio.
1121788_15_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Garmin Ltd.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 18, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P6_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P6_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	Fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 included 52 weeks.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of $20,874 and $85,363 as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange gains (losses) of ($4,299), $35,538, and ($20,022) for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	The loss in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling which was largely offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S4	The gain in fiscal 2013 was due primarily to the strengthening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P13_S5	The loss in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P16_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 22% and 26% of net sales since 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	On March 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the Agreement ) with Bombardier, Inc. ( Bombardier ).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Bombardier (the Program ).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013 and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Bombardier repaid the loan in five installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent amendment signed December 6, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	As of December 27, 2014, the Company had a loan receivable balance of $0 from Bombardier in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	On June 6, 2014, the shareholders approved a dividend of $1.92 per share (of which, $0.96 was paid in the Company's 2014 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.

1121788_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Approximately $290,955 and $265,880 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	At December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $191,034 and $183,431, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Accumulated amortization was $151,589 and $143,227 at December 27, 2014 and December 28, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $8,362, $17,847,and $21,437 for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $20,038, $7,481, $4,799, $4,122, and $2,811, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $178,638 at December 27, 2014 and $179,290 at December 28, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain(loss).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	At December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, cumulative unrealized gains and losses, net of tax of ($18,303) and ($47,322), respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Income taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P51_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P51_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Garmin introduced n Maps Lifetime in 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n Maps Lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	With the acquisition of Navigon AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Similar to n Maps Lifetime , LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with traffic service bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The second deliverable and potentially third deliverables are the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P57_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	As the sales of n Maps Lifetime and traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of n Maps Lifetime or traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling price was not available.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the LMU or traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	These estimates were also reflective of how the Company established product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or traffic service capability.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	As such, during 2012 and 2013, the Company estimated selling price of the undelivered element based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P58_S4	In 2014, the Company determined that stand-alone and unbundled unit sales no longer occurred on more than a limited basis, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin is therefore now used as the primary indicator in calculating relative selling price of the undelivered element.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P59_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	At December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $338,728 and $427,920, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $87,476 and $98,525, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	In the next three years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $152,262, $71,801, and $27,189, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S5	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P64_S6	The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	(1) Our expected future cost is estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns and the related warranty costs incurred.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	In 2013 we updated these assumptions and shortened the estimated time horizon in which we settle claims with our retail partners.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	(2) Minor changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties are aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the accrual for products sold line .
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P67_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $146,633, $112,905 and $138,757, for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $395,121, $364,923 and $325,773, for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin s compensation package for employees.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	Certain employees within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected life, forfeitures and dividends.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	If forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11 Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11), which is included in ASC Topic 740 (Income Taxes).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	ASU 2013-11 requires an entity to net its liability for unrecognized tax positions against a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	The provisions of this new guidance are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	The implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange or transferring goods or services to a customer.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	In applying the new guidance, a company will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P80_S3	The provisions of this new guidance are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be adopted using either a full retrospective or modified approach.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P80_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	The valuation methods used by the Company for each significant class of investments are summarized below.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions Valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Common stocks Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	Available for sale securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	(1) Represents impairment not related to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	(2) Represents unrealized losses on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in Other Income and the noncredit component in Other comprehensive income (loss) for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	During 2014 and 2013, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	In 2013, Garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $57,356 and $4,377 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 28, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2013 were $1,215,498 and $1,153,765, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	This decrease in estimated fair value was primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P94_S3	The decline was due to increases in the 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	The 10 Year Treasury Bond Yield decreased in 2014, resulting in a balance of $13,031 and $8,420 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 27, 2014 were $1,276,404 and $1,254,953, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	Approximately 59% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S3	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S4	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P95_S5	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table displays additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 27, 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	There was an immaterial amount of unrealized losses related to securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer as of December 28, 2013.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 27, 2014, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $19,559, $18,721 and $17,470 for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL and GC are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $308 and $249 at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $268,075 over the next five years.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	However, the Company s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P105_S3	During the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, expense related to these plans of $29,267, $26,839 and $22,159, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P106_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, were significant.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	As a direct and indirect result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307,635.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	The first cash tax payment of $78,137 associated with the restructuring was made in the third quarter of 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S4	We anticipate paying approximately $185,000 in the second quarter of 2015.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P109_S5	The remainder of the accrued tax is expected to be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since its redomestication to Switzerland effective June 27, 2010, is 7.83%.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2014 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $197,000 lower, or $57,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $44,000.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P110_S2	For 2013, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $178,000 lower, or $51,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $64,000.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P110_S3	For 2012, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $170,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $31,000.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P110_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $546,790, $502,423, and $495,908, for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $0.02, $0.03, and $0.03 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2017, at which time these tax benefits will likely expire.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Income taxes of $20,606, $307,990, and $252,452 at December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	These balances decreased in 2014 as a result of the intercompany restructuring which reduced the amount of earnings reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company recognized a $29,615 deferred tax asset during 2010 for the future tax benefit of the fair market value step-up in basis of intangible assets related to the redomestication to Switzerland and local statutory tax reporting requirements.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	The deferred tax asset was recognized as an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital in 2010 and will reverse as the intangible assets are amortized for Swiss statutory and tax reporting purposes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	At December 27, 2014, the Company had $2,726 of tax credit carryover compared to $55,435 at December 28, 2013, of which $52,618 was Taiwan surtax credit offset with a full valuation allowance.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The surtax credit carryover from 2013 of $52,618 was adjusted and subsequently fully utilized in 2014 upon the execution of the inter-company restructuring.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	In turn, the entire valuation allowance regarding the surtax credit was released.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	At December 27, 2014, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $12,456 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $87,388.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $8,125 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2027, $59,697 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2020, $11,958 related to the Netherlands that expires in varying amounts between 2014 and 2022, $1,299 that relates to Finland and expires in 2024 and $6,309 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 27, 2014 was $77,495.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 27, 2012 is as follows:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	The December 27, 2014 balance of $74,205 of net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	The entire $74,205, $125,918 and $173,532 are required to be classified as non-current at December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	At December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, the Company had accrued approximately $2,159, $5,111, and $8,222, respectively, for interest.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P121_S2	The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012 by ($2,953), ($3,111), and ($4,705), respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P121_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2012 and prior.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P122_S2	The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2008 and prior.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P122_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2011 and prior.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P122_S4	The Company is subject to Switzerland income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2010 through 2014.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $83,006, $74,217, and $9,027 in fiscal years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $5,000 to $10,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P125_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes auto/mobile, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	There are three operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM and mobile) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto/mobile reportable segment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEM s.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	The Company s marine, auto/mobile, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income before income taxes of each segment.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P135_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	Revenues, interest income, and income before income taxes for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below:
1121788_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	Net sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 27, 2014, December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P137_S1	Note that APAC refers to the Asia Pacific region, and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	(1) The U.S. is the only country which constitutes greater than 10% of net sales to external customers.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	(2) Americas and APAC net assets are primarily held in the United States and Taiwan, respectively.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	For all stock compensation plans, the company s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/SAR exercises, RSU releases and ESPP purchases.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	In June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the 2011 Directors Plan) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	The term of each award cannot exceed ten years.

1121788_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.

1121788_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.

1121788_15_ITEM8_P154_S3	The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

1121788_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	This certification accompanies the Form 10-K pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and shall not, except to the extent required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, be deemed filed by the Company for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1121788_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Pursuant to section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (subsections (a) and (b) of Section 1350, Chapter 63 of Title 18, United States Code), I, Douglas G. Boessen, Chief Financial Officer of Garmin Ltd. (the Company ) hereby certify that:

1121788_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	GPS/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Additionally, Euro denominated inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The auto segment, which represents approximately 37% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of certain components.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in Swiss, United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Recently, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued final recommendations to prevent perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	While these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Currently the Company has two shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power, totaling 35% of the outstanding shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Thus, the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater United States shareholder could result in classification as a CFC and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Taiwan has a unique international political status.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our users fitness-related data and personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our security measures and applications are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience a breach of systems compromising our users data or the media suggested that our security measures were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S5	It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P60_S6	A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are HERE (formerly known as NAVTEQ) and TomTom N.V. HERE is owned by Here Acquisition B.V. (a consortium of Daimler AG, BMW AG and Audi AG).
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Here Acquisition B.V. is owned by competitors to other global OEMs, who may not wish to utilize mapping content from a competitor.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	TomTom N.V. is a competitor of Garmin.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and HERE in February 2015 extending our HERE license agreement through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with HERE changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We may have additional income tax liabilities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We are subject to income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S6	In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P69_S7	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S6	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P71_S7	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P73_S4	If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Sales of certain of our fitness, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P80_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration operations would harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Any failure of Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	GPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P94_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P104_S2	It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business .
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P107_S1	During 2015, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.28 to a high of $56.81.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P107_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	As of January 25, 2016, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P111_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P113_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The Company has limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P115_S1	Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P116_S1	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P116_S2	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P117_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P117_S3	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P117_S4	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P118_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P118_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Under Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P120_S1	We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P120_S2	The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P120_S3	We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P120_S4	Our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P121_S0	As mentioned previously, we do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P121_S1	However, the repurchase of the Company s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM1A_P121_S3	We may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to United States shareholders holding percentages.

1121788_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	Upon the payment in full of the outstanding bonds, the City of Olathe is obligated to transfer title to Garmin s subsidiaries for the aggregate sum of $200.

1121788_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	ICON Health Fitness, Inc. v. Garmin Ltd., Garmin International, Inc., and Garmin USA, Inc.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	On November 18, 2011, ICON Health Fitness, Inc. filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Garmin Ltd., Garmin International, Inc., and Garmin USA, Inc. (collectively Garmin ), alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,789,800 (the 800 patent ) and 6,701,271 ( the 271 patent ).
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	On June 8, 2012, ICON filed an amended complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,626,799 and 6,921,351.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	On June 25, 2012, Garmin filed its answer asserting that each asserted claim of these additional patents-in-suit is invalid and/or not infringed.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	On April 11, 2013, the Court dismissed ICON s allegations of infringement of the 800 and 271 patents against Garmin without prejudice pursuant to a motion filed by ICON.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	On September 29, 2015, the court awarded summary judgment in favor of Garmin finding (a) that the 351 patent had been held to be invalid for indefiniteness by another federal district court and the doctrine of issue preclusion applied to prevent ICON from relitigating this issue, and (b) that the 799 patent is invalid because it covers unpatentable subject matter.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S5	On November 18, 2015, ICON appealed the Court s summary judgment ruling of invalidity of the 351 patent.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S6	ICON did not appeal the Court s invalidity finding on the 799 patent.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P1_S7	Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On July 18, 2014, Johnson Outdoors Inc. and Johnson Outdoors Marine Electronics Inc. filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ( ITC ) against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America, Inc., Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin Corporation (collectively Garmin ) alleging a violation of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, through alleged infringement by Garmin of U.S. Patents 7,652,952 ( the 952 patent ); 7,710,825 ( the 825 patent ); and 7,755,974 ( the 974 patent ).
1121788_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	On August 15, 2014 the ITC instituted an investigation pursuant to the complaint.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	Garmin believes that each asserted claim of the 952 patent, the 825 patent, and the 974 patent is invalid and/or not infringed and, in addition, that the 952, 825, and 974 patents are unenforceable under the doctrine of inequitable conduct and that Johnson Outdoors claims are barred in whole or in part by the doctrines of prosecution history estoppel and/or prosecution disclaimer.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	A trial hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was held on April 7 through April 10, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	On November 18, 2015 the ITC issued a Final Determination finding that the asserted claims of the 952, 825, and 974 patents are valid and enforceable but that there is no infringement by Garmin of any of the asserted claims of the 952 and 825 patents and that there is no infringement by Garmin of claim 25 of the 974 patent.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	The ITC found that there is infringement by Garmin of claims 14, 18, 21-23 and 33 of the 974 patent and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting the import into the U.S. of infringing products and a cease and desist order prohibiting certain domestic activities relating to the infringing products.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P4_S3	On January 16, 2016, Johnson Outdoors filed a petition for review of the ITC s Final Determination in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit ).

1121788_16_ITEM3_P4_S5	That motion was granted on February 4, 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	On February 10, 2016, Garmin filed its petition for review of the abovementioned Final Determination with the Federal Circuit.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	Garmin is seeking review of all issues appealable in the case.

1121788_16_ITEM3_P7_S0	Garmin believes that each asserted claim of the 499 patent, the 840 patent, and the 550 patent is invalid and/or not infringed.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P8_S0	A trial hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was held on March 18 through March 24, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination on July 2, 2015 finding that the asserted claims of the 840, 499 and 550 patents are valid but that there is no infringement by Garmin of the 840 patent, the 499 patent or the 550 patent.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P8_S2	On December 1, 2015 the ITC issued a Final Determination finding that most of the asserted claims of the 840, 499 and 550 patents are valid and that there is no infringement by Garmin of the 499 patent but that there is infringement by Garmin of the 840 and 550 patents.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P8_S3	The ITC held that claims 1, 7, 12, 13, and 57 of the 550 patent were invalid as obvious.

1121788_16_ITEM3_P13_S0	Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. Garmin Ltd. and Garmin International, Inc.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S0	On December 18, 2013, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S1	The lead plaintiff was Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S2	The class of plaintiffs that Andrea Katz purported to represent includes all individuals who purchased any model of Forerunner watch in the State of Illinois and the United States.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S3	Plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of Illinois statutory law.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S4	Plaintiff alleged that Forerunner watch bands have an unacceptable rate of failure in that they detach from the watch.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S5	Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys fees, and injunctive relief.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S6	On January 29, 2014 the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S7	On January 30, 2014, the plaintiff re-filed the lawsuit with the same claims for relief as the earlier action and adding an additional claim for unjust enrichment.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S8	On February 4, 2014, the court ordered the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Utah.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P14_S9	The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case filed in Illinois and, on March 6, 2014, she refiled the lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Utah with the same claims, but with additional claims for violations of the Utah Consumers Sales Practice Act, Lanham Act, and Utah Truth in Advertising Act.

1121788_16_ITEM3_P15_S0	On March 31, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to transfer the venue of the Utah action back to the Northern District of Illinois.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P15_S1	On October 21, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Utah denied Garmin s motion to transfer venue.
1121788_16_ITEM3_P15_S2	On December 26, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to dismiss certain counts of the complaint.

1121788_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company s fiscal year and fiscal periods.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to we, us, our and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, auto, and aviation markets.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	For information on each of the following critical accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan; Yangzhou, China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	The Yangzhou, China facility was opened in 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	In recent years, pricing has stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	In 2014 and 2015, fitness pricing declined due to high volumes of lower-priced activity trackers.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales decreased 2% in 2015 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	All segments, excluding aviation, were impacted by revenues denominated in currencies that have weakened against the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	In total, it is estimated that the strong U.S. Dollar reduced revenues by approximately $189 million, which represents 6% of revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 37% in the fiscal year 2015 compared to 43% in the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Total unit sales increased 7% to 16.2 million units in 2015 from 15.1 million units in 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to fitness and marine volumes partially offset by declines in each of the other segments.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 15% from the year-ago period, as both the contribution of amortization of previously deferred revenue declined when compared to 2014 and volumes declined.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Fitness revenues increased 16% on the strength of our wearables portfolio.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Aviation revenues increased 3% from the year-ago period as market share gains were partially offset by industry weakness.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	Outdoor revenues decreased 1% from the year-ago period due to geographic exposure to weak currencies and maturing product categories largely offset by the strength of outdoor wearables.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Revenues in our marine segment increased 15% as the release of new marine products drove strong revenue growth.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company anticipates revenue of approximately $2.82 billion in 2016 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 1% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenue increased in part due to a stronger U.S. Dollar that created downward pressure on revenue in all segments excluding aviation as discussed above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	In the auto segment, the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	In the fitness segment, the cost of goods increase outpaced revenue growth due to product mix and competitive pricing dynamics.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	The cost of goods increases in marine are due to increased sales of higher margin products.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Aviation cost of goods was lower due to product mix.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively consistent in 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2015 decreased 4% while gross profit margin decreased 130 basis points compared to fiscal year 2014 with all segments declining, excluding marine and aviation.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Segment specific gross margin drivers are discussed above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively consistent in 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Advertising expense increased 14% in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in absolute dollars occurred in fitness and marine to support new product introductions with increased media spend, point of sale presence at key retailers and cooperative advertising.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	This was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes and in outdoor due to fewer new product categories.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management expects advertising expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat in 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The absolute dollar increase is primarily related to litigation related costs, information technology costs and product support.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Marine expense growth exceeded other segments due to specific litigation matters.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in 2016 due primarily to acquisitions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout fiscal year 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $31.9 million when compared with fiscal year 2014 and increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2016 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a result of the above, operating income decreased 20% in absolute dollars and 460 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Declining gross margin percentages and increases in all operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, as discussed above, contributed to the decline.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 were 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease in interest income is attributable to decreasing cash and investment balances and a slight decrease in the interest rates.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	As these entities have grown, currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss results from the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the Company s subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S5	Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions can also generate currency gains and losses.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P41_S6	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The majority of the $23.5 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	During fiscal year 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% compared to the Euro resulting in a net loss of $31.2 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	This was largely offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $19.5 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	The remaining net currency loss of $11.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The majority of the $4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting in a net loss of $43.7 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	This was more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $44.8 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	During fiscal year 2015, Garmin recorded other income of $11.4 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	This income was primarily due to a legal settlement received during the year and a gain on the disposal of property.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our income tax expense decreased by $248.6 million, to $111.0 million for the fiscal year 2015, from $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Contributing to the significant decrease was:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax audits of $7.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to releases of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	In addition, the full year income mix by tax jurisdiction for 2015 compared to 2014 is unfavorable resulting in an increased effective tax rate.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307.6 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	The first and second cash tax payments of $78.1 million and $182.8 million associated with the restructuring were made in the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	The remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company expects the effective income tax rate to be approximately 20.5% in 2016.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 25% to $456.2 million for the fiscal year 2015 compared to $364.2 million for the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Net sales increased 9% in 2014 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	All segments, excluding auto, grew in the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 43% in the fiscal year 2014 compared to 49% in the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Total unit sales increased 9% to 15.1 million units in 2014 from 13.9 million units in 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to growth in all segments except auto which had volume decline due to penetration rates and competing technologies.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 5% from fiscal year 2013, as a 10% volume decline and slight average selling price (ASP) decline, were partially offset by amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current period revenue deferrals and increased auto OEM contributions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Revenues in our fitness segment increased 60% from fiscal year 2013 on the strength of wellness products first introduced in 2014, and recent biking and running product introductions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	Aviation revenues increased 14% from fiscal year 2013 as both OEM market share gains and aftermarket strength contributed to growth.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	Outdoor revenues increased 4% from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to strong sales of f nix 2 and our lineup of dog tracking and training products, offset by declining sales of our handheld products which serve a mature industry.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S4	Revenues in our marine segment increased 11% due to both the recent acquisition of Fusion Electronics as well as new product introductions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P54_S5	This growth was partially offset by a competitive pricing environment in the global marine electronics industry.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 3% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase was driven by growth in all segments excluding auto.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Fitness and marine cost of goods increased in-line with sales growth as described above with gross margins stable year-over-year.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	Outdoor cost of goods increased due to sales growth with gross margin contraction driven by product mix.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased 240 basis points from fiscal year 2013 with improvement or stability in each segment, excluding outdoor as mentioned above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The auto cost of goods improvement as a percent of revenues was primarily due to benefit from the amortization of previously deferred revenue and costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased contribution of software sales which carry a higher margin.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2014 increased 14% while gross profit margin increased 240 basis points compared to fiscal year 2013 with all segments stable or improving, excluding outdoor.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The auto, fitness, marine and aviation segments recorded improved gross margins, as discussed above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Outdoor gross profit margins declined, as discussed above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Advertising expense increased 30% in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in absolute dollars occurred primarily in outdoor and fitness to support new product introductions and was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Aviation advertising increased materially due to increased cooperative advertising efforts with our dealers.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 5% in absolute dollars and declined 50 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The absolute dollar increase is primarily related to product support, information technology costs and legal costs specific to marine litigation.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The aviation increase was primarily driven by product support costs.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Other variances by segment, excluding aviation, are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $30.2 million when compared with fiscal year 2013 and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Fitness, outdoor and aviation increased to support new product initiatives.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	Auto investment declined due to efforts to allocate research and development spending to areas with the highest growth potential.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	As a result of the above, operating income increased 20% in absolute dollars and 220 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Revenue growth and an improving gross margin percentage, as discussed above, contributed to the growth.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	By segment results are discussed above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2014 and 2013 were 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The slight increase in interest income was offset by fewer capital gains on investments in 2014, which is recorded as Other income.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The majority of the $4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting in a net loss of $43.7 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	This was more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $44.8 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The majority of the $35.5 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and British Pound Sterling contributed additional gains.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	During 2013, the U.S. Dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P69_S4	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the Company.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our income tax expense increased by $318.4 million, to $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014, from $41.1 million for the fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Contributing to the significant increase were:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	research and development tax credits of $6.3 million related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in January 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Partially offset by favorable impacts including:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax audits of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014 compared to releases of $79.9 million in fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 41% to $364.2 million for the fiscal year 2014 compared to $612.4 million for fiscal year 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The $242.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The $107.4 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	the impact of deferred income taxes providing $81.9 million more cash due primarily to timing of disbursements partially related to the inter-company restructuring in addition to the reclassification of withholding taxes from current taxes payable.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We expect to generate $475 million of cash flow from operations in 2016 with ongoing net income.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The $243.3 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	The $405.8 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	We have budgeted approximately $75 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	Garmin s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 were approximately 1.2%, 1.3%, and 1.4%, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	See Footnote 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	The $99.5 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The $192.8 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our dividend has progressively increased from $0.45 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in June 2012 to $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the four quarters beginning in June 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Future commitments of Garmin, as of December 26, 2015, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, are:
1121788_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2015 was approximately $278.3 million.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $97.9 million as of December 26, 2015, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency .
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S3	In 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% relative to the Euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $31.2 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $19.5 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P8_S5	The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $11.8 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $23.5 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $35.0 million during the fiscal year 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $95 million and $118 million at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P12_S2	During 2015 and 2014, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company s portfolio of marketable securities.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Based on balance sheet positions as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all maturities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $43 million and $52 million at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM7A_P13_S2	Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Garmin Ltd.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P6_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P6_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P8_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company has adopted a 52 53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 included 52 weeks.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P12_S3	Cumulative translation adjustments of ($14,108) and $20,874 as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange (losses) gains of ($23,465), ($4,299), and $35,538, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	The loss in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro partially offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P14_S3	The loss in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling which was largely offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P14_S4	The gain in fiscal 2013 was due primarily to the strengthening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P17_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 22% and 24% of net sales since 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	On March 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the Agreement ) with Bombardier, Inc. ( Bombardier ).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Bombardier (the Program ).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013 and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Bombardier repaid the loan in five installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent amendment signed December 6, 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2015, 2014, or 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company s shareholders.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	On June 5, 2015, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.02 was paid in the Company's 2015 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2015 in the amount of $378,117.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	On June 6, 2014, the shareholders approved a dividend of $1.92 per share (of which, $0.96 was paid in the Company's 2014 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2014 in the amount of $360,075.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	On June 7, 2013, the shareholders approved a dividend of $1.80 per share (of which, $0.90 was paid in the Company's 2013 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2013 in the amount of $351,707.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Approximately $304,674 and $290,955 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	At December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $216,465 and $191,034, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years, which represents the expected pattern and duration of use of and benefit received from the respective assets.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	Accumulated amortization was $158,704 and $151,589 at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P37_S3	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $7,115, $8,362 and $17,847, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P37_S4	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $19,780, $7,506, $6,734, $4,787 and $3,610, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $187,791 at December 26, 2015 and $178,638 at December 27, 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain (loss).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	At December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, cumulative unrealized gains and losses, net of tax of ($16,321) and ($18,303), respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Income taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	For the large majority of Garmin s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P51_S4	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, in-dash navigation solutions, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Garmin offers PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with traffic service bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The remaining deliverables are the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P55_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P55_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU and/or the traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the products.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company has determined sufficient VSOE does not exist for LMU or traffic, and that third party evidence of selling price is not available.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	During 2013, the Company estimated selling price of the undelivered element based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled PND units, and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	These estimates were reflective of how the Company established product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added LMU or traffic service capability to the PND.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P56_S3	In 2014, the Company determined that stand-alone and unbundled unit sales no longer occurred on more than a limited basis, and therefore began using the royalty cost plus a normal margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative selling prices of the undelivered elements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin s operating results.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P57_S4	If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin s historical experience.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	At December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $293,713 and $338,728 , respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $87,945 and $87,476, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to five years on a straight-line basis.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	In the next five years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $115,806, $60,971, $21,467, $5,356 and $2,168, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S5	To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P62_S6	The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	(1) Our expected future cost is estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns and the related warranty costs incurred.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	In 2013 we updated these assumptions and shortened the estimated time horizon in which we settle claims with our retail partners.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	(2) Minor changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties are aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the accrual for products sold line .
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P65_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $167,166, $146,633, and $112,905, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $427,043, $395,121, and $364,923, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P68_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P72_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	In applying the new guidance, a company will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	The new standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or in a modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect will be recognized as of the date of adoption.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of the new guidance by one year such that the new provisions will now be required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	The valuation methods used by the Company for each significant class of investments are summarized below.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions Valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Common stocks Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Available for sale securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	(1) Certain available-for-sale securities held as of December 27, 2014 have been reclassified among major security types to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	These reclassifications had no effect on fair value measurement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	(1) Represents impairment not related to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	(2) Represents unrealized losses on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	(3) Certain available-for-sale securities held as of December 27, 2014 have been reclassified among major security types to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	These reclassifications had no effect on fair value measurement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in Other Income and the noncredit component in Other comprehensive income (loss) for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	In 2013, the Company experienced unrealized, noncredit losses on its investment portfolio resulting in gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	During 2014 and 2015, the Company did not record any material impairment changes on its outstanding securities.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 26, 2015 were $1,299,856 and $1,281,150, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	Approximately 63.6% of securities in the Company s portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P92_S4	The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table displays additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	(1) Certain available- for-sale securities held as of December 27, 2014 have been reclassified amount major security types to confirm to the current year presentation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	These reclassifications had no effect on fair value measurement.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 26, 2015, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $18,104, $19,559 and $18,721 for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL and GC are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $259 and $308 at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2015 was approximately $278,327.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual or disclosure.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	Management of the Company currently does not believe there is at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies individually and in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	The results of legal proceeding, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	Although management considers the likelihood to be remote, an adverse resolution of one of more of such matters in excess of management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company settled or resolved certain matters during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P106_S2	In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P106_S3	During the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, expense related to these and other defined contribution plans of $37,489, $29,267 and $26,839, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, were significant.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307,635.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	Approximately $263,000 of this amount has been paid.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P110_S4	The remainder of the accrued tax is expected to be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the Redomestication effective June 27, 2010, is 7.83%.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2015 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be $154,000 lower, or $44,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $52,000.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	For 2014, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $197,000 lower, or $57,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $44,000.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P111_S3	For 2013, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $178,000 lower, or $51,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $64,000.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P111_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $403,242, $546,790, and $502,423, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2017, at which time these tax benefits will likely expire.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	Income taxes of $21,085, $20,606, and $307,990 at December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	These balances decreased in 2014 as a result of the inter-company restructuring which reduced the amount of earnings reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	The stock options outstanding related to the deferred tax asset of $35,360 will begin to expire over the next several years.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	Given the exercise price of the options expiring over the next 12 months compared to the current market price it is possible that these options will expire unexercised, resulting in a potential write-off of $6,000 that would reduce the deferred tax asset and reduce equity.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ), requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	The standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	Early adoption is permitted, and the Company elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard as of December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	At December 26, 2015, the Company had $3,906 of tax credit carryover compared to $2,726 at December 27, 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	The surtax credit carryover from 2013 of $52,618 was adjusted and subsequently fully utilized in 2014 upon the execution of the inter-company restructuring.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P119_S2	In turn, the entire valuation allowance regarding the surtax credit was released.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	At December 26, 2015, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $5,228 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $19,580.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $7,092 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2027, $338 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2022, $4,238 related to the Netherlands and expires in varying amounts between 2017 and 2022, $1,317 that relates to Finland and expires in 2025, $1,300 that relates to the United States and expires in 2035, and $5,295 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015 was $97,904.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013 is as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	The entire balance of net unrecognized benefits of $93,654, $74,205 and $125,918 are required to be classified as non-current at December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P123_S3	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	At December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, the Company had accrued approximately $2,479, $2,159, and $5,111, respectively, for interest.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P124_S2	The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013 by $320, ($2,953), and ($3,111), respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P124_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2012 and prior.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2009 and prior.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2012 and prior.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P125_S4	The Company is subject to Switzerland income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2011 through 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $6,971, $83,006, and $74,217 in fiscal years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $5,000 to 10,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P128_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	The Company has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes auto, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEMs.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Company s marine, auto, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	In 2015, the measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM to assess segment performance and allocate resources changed from income before income taxes to operating income.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P134_S2	This change did not impact the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss in the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses, including certain allocated general and administrative costs.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P136_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	Revenues, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Net sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	Note that APAC refers to the Asia Pacific region, and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	(1) The U.S. is the only country which constitutes greater than 10% of net sales to external customers.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	(2) Americas and APAC net assets are primarily held in the United States and Taiwan, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	For all stock compensation plans, the company s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	In June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the 2011 Directors Plan ) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	The term of each award cannot exceed ten years.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P143_S2	Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P143_S3	In 2015, 2014, and 2013, 12,008, 7,120, and 11,484, restricted stock units were granted under this plan.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	In June 2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the 2005 Plan ) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional 3,000,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 13,000,000.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Option and SAR grants vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P145_S1	RSUs granted prior to December 10, 2012 vested or are vesting evenly over a period of five years, while RSUs granted on and after that date vest evenly over a period of three years.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P145_S2	In addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU grants is also contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue and profitability goals.

1121788_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2015, 2014, or 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Also in October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the 2000 Directors Plan ) providing for grants of options for up to 100,000 common shares.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P147_S1	In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000.

1121788_16_ITEM8_P147_S3	All awards vest evenly over a three-year period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P147_S4	Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares under this plan.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	A summary of the Company s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Directors Plan for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 is provided below:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2015 is 1.81 and 1.67 years, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 26, 2015 was 1.54 years.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	The fair value of awards is determined at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P150_S1	The fair value of RSUs is calculated using the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period, which are not accrued.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P150_S2	The fair value of stock options and SARs was calculated with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2014 and 2013.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P150_S3	No options or SARs were granted in 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	The total fair value of awards vested during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $23,351, $19,127, and $20,956, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2015 were $207 and $207, respectively.

1121788_16_ITEM8_P152_S4	The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $20,787, $28,119, and $27,007 respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P153_S2	The Company s closing stock price was $36.98 on December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P153_S3	As of December 26, 2015, there was $52,590 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P153_S4	That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	The shareholders also adopted an ESPP.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S1	Up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP with shareholders approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in June 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S2	Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S3	The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S4	During 2015, 2014, and 2013, 488,753, 349,982, and 395,220, shares, respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $16,789, $14,634, and $12,181, respectively.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S5	During 2015, 2014, and 2013, the purchases were issued from treasury shares.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P154_S6	At December 26, 2015, approximately 2,000,628 shares were available for future issuance.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:
1121788_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	There were 4,087, 2,240 and 5,475 outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units (collectively equity awards ) excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years of 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	On February 13, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares through December 31, 2016.

1121788_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	These results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results (the table may not foot due to rounding).
1121788_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	On January 13, 2016, Garmin International, Inc. acquired PulsedLight, Inc., a privately-held designer of optical distance measurement technology based in Bend, Oregon.
1121788_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	On February 11, 2016, Garmin Ltd. announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire DeLorme, a privately-held company that designs and markets consumer based satellite tracking devices with two-way communication and navigational capabilities based in Yarmouth, Maine.

1121788_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Based on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management s effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Garmin Ltd. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1121788_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

1121788_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	This certification accompanies the Form 10-K pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and shall not, except to the extent required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, be deemed filed by the Company for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If the wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline, such as fitness trackers or smartwatches, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	GPS/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced profits in some periods.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The auto segment, which represents approximately 29% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as PNDs became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	This has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, periods of lower revenues and profits for this segment.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Income and expense activity in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	However, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in Swiss, United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Corporate reform being considered in the United States could significantly change our tax liability such as proposals to remove certain domestic deductions, implement border adjustments, and/or broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Moreover, international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	While these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A significant portion of our global and U.S. sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in Taiwan and the PRC.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The imposition of additional U.S. or foreign governmental controls, regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the U.S., or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including goods imported from China and Taiwan, could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (EU).
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the timing and terms of the expected exit.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We have operations in the UK and several EU member states whose currencies, namely British Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro, economies, taxation, and trade regulation, among other factors, could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the UK s leaving the EU, which is likely to be a lengthy and complicated process.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	These events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the past we have experienced shortages of certain components.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We do not expect to become a CFC.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Currently the Company has two shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power, totaling 36% of the outstanding shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Thus, the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater United States shareholder could result in classification as a CFC and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty-day period in any year, the Company s shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the one-China policy.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Deviations from the one-China policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our users fitness-related data and personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If our security measures or applications are breached, disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P62_S5	While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, and a newly adopted data protection regulation in the E.U. will go into effect in May 2018.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S5	It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P66_S6	A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	The two largest digital map suppliers are HERE (formerly known as NAVTEQ) and TomTom N.V. HERE is owned by Here Acquisition B.V. (a consortium of Daimler AG, BMW AG and Audi AG).
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Here Acquisition B.V. and TomTom N.V. are also competitors of Garmin.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement between Garmin and HERE extending through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with HERE changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S6	In addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P72_S7	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S4	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S6	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the United States who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P74_S7	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P76_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P76_S4	If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P83_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration operations would harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Any failure of the United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	GPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	A shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P106_S2	It is also possible that the U.S. Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business .
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	During 2016, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.29 to a high of $55.75.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P109_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	As of January 18, 2017, current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 41.36% of our outstanding common shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P113_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P115_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P118_S1	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P118_S2	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P119_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P119_S3	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P119_S4	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P120_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P120_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Under Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P122_S1	We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P122_S2	The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P122_S3	We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P122_S4	Our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	As mentioned previously, we do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P123_S1	However, the repurchase of the Company s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM1A_P123_S3	We may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to United States shareholders holding percentages.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Garmin s average returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were approximately 1.5%, 1.2%, and 1.3%, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	See Note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	The $61.6 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	The $99.5 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	Our dividend has progressively increased from $0.45 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in June 2012 to $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in June 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P6_S0	We primarily use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, to pay dividends, and to fund share repurchases.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P6_S1	We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P6_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P7_S0	As of December 31, 2016, operating leases comprise the substance of the Company s commercial commitments with long-term scheduled payments, as summarized below:
1121788_17_ITEM2_P8_S0	The Company is party to certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P8_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $403.1 million.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P8_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P9_S0	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P10_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P10_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P10_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $115.1 million as of December 31, 2016, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P10_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_17_ITEM2_P11_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. Garmin Ltd. and Garmin International, Inc.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	On December 18, 2013, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	The lead plaintiff was Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S2	The class of plaintiffs that Andrea Katz purported to represent includes all individuals who purchased any model of Forerunner watch in the State of Illinois and the United States.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S3	Plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of Illinois statutory law.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S4	Plaintiff alleged that Forerunner watch bands have an unacceptable rate of failure in that they detach from the watch.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S5	Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys fees, and injunctive relief.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S6	On January 29, 2014 the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S7	On January 30, 2014, the plaintiff re-filed the lawsuit with the same claims for relief as the earlier action and adding an additional claim for unjust enrichment.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S8	On February 4, 2014, the court ordered the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Utah.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S9	The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case filed in Illinois and, on March 6, 2014, she refiled the lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Utah with the same claims, but with additional claims for violations of the Utah Consumers Sales Practice Act, Lanham Act, and Utah Truth in Advertising Act.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P1_S10	The relief she requested is the same.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	On March 31, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to transfer the venue of the Utah action back to the Northern District of Illinois.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	On October 21, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Utah denied Garmin s motion to transfer venue.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	On December 26, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to dismiss certain counts of the complaint.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	On April 16, 2015 the court granted Garmin s motion in part and dismissed with prejudice (i) Mr. Katz s (but not Mrs. Katz s) claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, (ii) the plaintiffs Lanham Act claim, (iii) the plaintiffs negligence claim and (iv) the plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation claim.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S4	The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit in consideration of a settlement under which Garmin would pay the plaintiff s counsel $385,000 in attorneys fees and would repair or replace Forerunner 610 watchbands and watches at no cost provided that a request is made within twelve months of the date of the final approval of the settlement by the court.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P2_S5	On November 3, 2016 the court granted final approval of the settlement.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	On June 9, 2014 Navico Inc. and Navico Holding AS filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ( ITC ) against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America, Inc., Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin (Asia) Corporation (collectively Garmin ) alleging a violation of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, through alleged infringement by Garmin of U.S. Patents 8,300,499 ( the 499 patent ); 8,305,840 ( the 840 patent ); and 8,605,550 ( the 550 patent ).
1121788_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	On July 9, 2014 the ITC instituted an investigation pursuant to the complaint.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	Garmin believes that each asserted claim of the 499 patent, the 840 patent, and the 550 patent is invalid and/or not infringed.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	A trial hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was held on March 18 through March 24, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	The Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination on July 2, 2015 finding that the asserted claims of the 840, 499 and 550 patents are valid but that there is no infringement by Garmin of the 840 patent, the 499 patent or the 550 patent.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P5_S2	On December 1, 2015 the ITC issued a Final Determination finding that most of the asserted claims of the 840, 499 and 550 patents are valid and that there is no infringement by Garmin of the 499 patent but that there is infringement by Garmin of the 840 and 550 patents.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P5_S3	The ITC held that claims 1, 7, 12, 13, and 57 of the 550 patent were invalid as obvious.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P6_S0	The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting the import into the USA of infringing products and cease and desist orders prohibiting certain domestic activities relating to the infringing products.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P7_S0	On January 27, 2016, Navico filed a petition for review of the ITC s Final Determination in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit ).
1121788_17_ITEM3_P7_S1	On February 10, 2016, Garmin filed with the Federal Circuit: (i) a motion to intervene in Navico's appeal, and (ii) a petition for review of the abovementioned Final Determination.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P7_S2	Garmin is seeking review of all issues appealable in the case, including the portions of the Final Determination finding infringement of the 840 and 550 patents.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P8_S0	On February 16, 2016 Navico filed a request that the ITC initiate an enforcement proceeding in connection with alleged violations by Garmin of the ITC s cease and desist orders.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P8_S1	On June 3, 2016 Navico withdrew, without prejudice, its request that the ITC initiate an enforcement proceeding.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P9_S0	On May 20, 2016 Navico filed a petition for modification of the limited exclusion order issued by the ITC.

1121788_17_ITEM3_P11_S0	On August 30, 2016, Navico filed a new request that the ITC initiate an enforcement proceeding for alleged violations by Garmin of the cease and desist orders issued by the ITC.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P11_S1	The ITC initiated that proceeding on October 11, 2016.

1121788_17_ITEM3_P12_S0	Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P13_S0	And Navico Holding AS v. Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P14_S0	On June 4, 2014 Navico Inc. and Navico Holding AS filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patents 8,300,499 ( the 499 patent ); 8,305,840 ( the 840 patent ); and 8,605,550 ( the 550 patent ).
1121788_17_ITEM3_P14_S1	On October 21, 2014, Garmin filed its answer asserting that each asserted claim of the 499, 840, and 550 patents is invalid and/or not infringed.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P14_S2	On September 30, 2015, the court held a hearing on claim construction and the parties await the court s claim construction order.
1121788_17_ITEM3_P15_S0	On December 4, 2015 Garmin filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity on the basis that the asserted claims of the 840 and 550 patents are invalid for failure to comply with the definiteness requirements of 35 U.S.S. 112 and that the asserted claims of 840 and 550 patents are also invalid for failure to comply with the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. 112 and for summary judgment of non-infringement on the basis that there is no infringement by Garmin of the asserted claims of the 499 patent.

1121788_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to we, us, our and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, auto, and aviation markets.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	As such, the segments are managed separately.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	For information on each of the following critical accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature, and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results, and backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan; Yangzhou manufacturing plant in China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	In recent years, pricing has stabilized in auto, allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	In 2016 the Company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The overall impact of the move was immaterial.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	However, action camera related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	For each line item in the table, the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales increased 7% in 2016 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	All segments had an increase in revenue except for auto.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 29% in the 53-weeks ended 2016 compared to 38% in the 52-weeks ended 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Total unit sales increased 4% to 16.8 million units in 2016 from 16.2 million units in 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 17% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation revenues increased 33%, 24%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increases in sales volumes.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Growth in outdoor was driven by wearables and the newly acquired DeLorme product lines.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	The increase in fitness was driven by wearables with Garmin Elevate TM wrist heart rate technology.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our marine segment increased due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment systems.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Aviation revenues increased due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 4% in absolute dollars for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	In the auto segment, the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	In the outdoor and fitness segments, the increases of 32% and 29% in cost of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	In the marine and aviation segments, the increases of 16% and 6%, respectively, primarily reflect volume growth.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Gross profit dollars in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% while gross profit margin increased 100 basis points compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	Fitness margin declined to 53% due to product mix.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	All other segment gross margin rates are relatively consistent between fiscal periods.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Advertising expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to outdoor and fitness, partially offset by auto.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 4% and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to information technology costs and salaries and benefits.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues with the exception of the marine segment, as expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Research and development expense increased 10% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $40.9 million when compared with the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015, and increased 40 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	As a result of the above, operating income increased 14% in absolute dollars and 120 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Revenue growth with a slight increase in gross margin percentage contributed to the growth, slightly offset by increased operating expenses, as discussed above, with the exception of the marine segment, as operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The average return on cash and investments during the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 and the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 were 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The $31.7 million currency loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The $23.5 million currency loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% against the Euro and 4.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $31.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	This was largely offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $19.5 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	The remaining net currency loss of $9.7 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	During the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, Garmin recorded other income of $4.0 million compared to $11.4 million in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease in fiscal 2016 relates primarily to a legal settlement received in fiscal 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our income tax expense increased by $7.9 million, to $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, from $111.0 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As described in Note 14, the Company expects to revalue certain Switzerland deferred tax assets, for which the Company anticipates recording approximately $150 million of income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	This may result in cash outlays for income taxes exceeding income tax expense recognized in certain future periods.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 12% to $510.8 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to $456.2 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2016 the Company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The overall impact of the move was immaterial.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	However, action camera related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net sales decreased 2% in 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	All segments, excluding aviation, were impacted by revenues denominated in currencies that weakened against the U.S. Dollar during the period.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	In total, it is estimated that the strong U.S. Dollar reduced revenues by approximately $189 million, which represents 6% of revenue.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 38% in the fiscal year 2015 compared to 44% in the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Total unit sales increased 7% to 16.2 million units in 2015 from 15.1 million units in 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to fitness and marine volumes partially offset by declines in each of the other segments.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 16% from fiscal year 2014, as both the contribution of amortization of previously deferred revenue declined when compared to 2014 and volumes declined.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Fitness revenues increased 16% on the strength of our wearables portfolio.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Aviation revenues increased 3% from fiscal year 2014 as market share gains were partially offset by industry weakness.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	Outdoor revenues remained relatively flat to fiscal year 2014, as geographic exposure to weak currencies and maturing product categories were largely offset by the strength of outdoor wearables.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	Revenues in our marine segment increased 15% as the release of new marine products drove strong revenue growth.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 1% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Cost of goods as a percentage of revenue increased in part due to a stronger U.S. Dollar that created downward pressure on revenue in all segments excluding aviation as discussed above.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	In the auto segment, the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	In the fitness and outdoor segments, the cost of goods increase outpaced revenue growth due to product mix and competitive pricing dynamics.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	The cost of goods decrease as a percentage of revenue in marine is due to increased sales of higher margin products.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	Aviation cost of goods was lower due to product mix.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2015 decreased 4% while gross profit margin decreased 130 basis points compared to fiscal year 2014 with all segments declining, excluding marine and aviation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Segment specific gross margin drivers are discussed above.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Advertising expense increased 14% in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase in absolute dollars occurred in fitness and marine to support new product introductions with increased media spend, point of sale presence at key retailers and cooperative advertising.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	This was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes and in outdoor due to fewer new product categories.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The absolute dollar increase is primarily related to litigation related costs, information technology costs and product support.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Marine expense growth exceeded other segments due to specific litigation matters.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Research and development expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout fiscal year 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $31.9 million when compared with fiscal year 2014 and increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	As a result of the above, operating income decreased 20% in absolute dollars and 460 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Declining gross margin percentages and increases in all operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, as discussed above, contributed to the decline.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 were 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in interest income is attributable to decreasing cash and investment balances and a slight decrease in the interest rates.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	As these entities have grown, currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss results from the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the Company s subsidiaries.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The $23.5 million currency loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% against the Euro and 4.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $31.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	This was largely offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $19.5 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	The remaining net currency loss of $9.7 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The majority of the $4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting in a net loss of $43.7 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	This was more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $44.8 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	During fiscal year 2015, Garmin recorded other income of $11.4 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	This income was primarily due to a legal settlement received during the year and a gain on the disposal of property.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our income tax expense decreased by $248.6 million, to $111.0 million for the fiscal year 2015, from $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Contributing to the significant decrease was:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax audits of $7.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to releases of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	In addition, the full year income mix by tax jurisdiction for 2015 compared to 2014 is resulting in an increased effective tax rate.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307.6 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	The cash tax payments of $78.1 million and $182.8 million associated with the restructuring were made in the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	The remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 25% to $456.2 million for the fiscal year 2015 compared to $364.2 million for the fiscal year 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The $425.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The $242.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The $9.6 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The $243.3 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:
1121788_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have budgeted approximately $130 million to $140 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During fiscal year 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $9.2 million foreign currency loss.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $13.0 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The U.S. Dollar strengthened 16.8% against the British Pound Sterling resulting in a loss of $5.1 million.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P9_S3	The net result of these currency moves combined with other net losses of $4.4 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $31.7 million for the Company and a currency translation adjustment of $4.7 million during the fiscal year 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $92 million and $95 million at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The Company s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P13_S2	During 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P14_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company s portfolio of marketable securities.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Based on balance sheet positions as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $45 million and $43 million at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	At the Company s Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved the cancellation of 10,000,000 registered shares of the Company held by the Company (the Formation Shares ) and the reduction in par value of each share of the Company from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company s Articles of Association to effect a corresponding share capital reduction.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company s fiscal year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year, and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2016 included 53 weeks.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	Cumulative currency translation adjustments of ($9,411) and ($14,107) as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts on operating income when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $31,651, $23,465, and $4,299, for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	The loss in fiscal 2016 was due primarily to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P14_S3	The loss in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P14_S4	The loss in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, which was largely offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the options were outstanding.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P17_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 22% and 24% of net sales since 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than or equal to 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	On March 14, 2013, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the Agreement ) with Bombardier, Inc. ( Bombardier ).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Bombardier (the Program ).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013 and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Bombardier repaid the loan in five installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent amendment signed December 6, 2013.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined by a discounted cash flow model in step one of the impairment analysis, the second step of the analysis will be performed.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Each of the Company s operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness) represents a distinct reporting unit.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company did not recognize any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2016, 2015, or 2014, and step two was not considered necessary in any of those periods as fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying amount for all reporting units in the respective periods.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	As noted above, the PND market has declined as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	This has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company s auto PND reporting unit.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	Consequently, if operating results and/or market conditions deteriorate significantly faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in our estimation of fair value, the goodwill associated with the Company s auto PND reporting unit may be at risk of impairment in the future.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company s shareholders.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	On June 10, 2016, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.53 was paid in the Company s 2016 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2016 in the amount of $481,452.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	On June 5, 2015, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.02 was paid in the Company's 2015 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2015 in the amount of $378,117.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	On June 6, 2014, the shareholders approved a dividend of $1.92 per share (of which, $0.96 was paid in the Company's 2014 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2014 in the amount of $360,075.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, approximately $304,674 of retained earnings was indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	At December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $253,472 and $216,465, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accumulated amortization was $173,023 and $158,704 at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $14,319, $7,115, and $8,362 for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $15,727, $14,502, $11,798, $9,301, and $4,931, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $224,553 at December 31, 2016 and $187,791 at December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	At December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, cumulative unrealized net losses of $27,350 and $16,321, respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company recognizes liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P52_S3	If the Company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Income taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	For the large majority of the Company s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, in-dash navigation solutions, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company offers PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	In addition, the Company offers PNDs with traffic service bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The remaining deliverables are the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P59_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU and/or the traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the products.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company has determined sufficient VSOE does not exist for LMU or traffic, and that third party evidence of selling price is not available as stand-alone and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Therefore, the Company uses the royalty cost plus a normal margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative selling prices of the LMU and traffic elements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	For multiple-element software arrangements that do not include a tangible product, the Company allocates revenue to the various elements based on VSOE.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	When VSOE cannot be established for undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until the earlier point at which all elements of the arrangement are delivered or sufficient VSOE does exist, unless the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	If the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support, the entire arrangement consideration is recognized ratably over the support period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	The Company offers navigation software licenses to certain customers, bundled with map updates to be provided periodically over the support period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	The Company has determined sufficient VSOE of similar map updates does not exist for certain arrangements, and therefore revenue from these transactions is recognized ratably over the contractual map update period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company s operating results.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S4	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P62_S5	If market conditions were to decline, the Company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	At December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $286,971 and $293,713, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $103,546 and $87,945, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives, typically two to five years, on a straight-line basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	In the next five years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $99,169, $49,605, $23,027, $8,255, and $3,369, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation .
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S5	To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P66_S6	The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	(1) Changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties are aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the accrual for products sold line .
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product, or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P68_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $177,143, $167,166, and $146,633, for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $467,960, $427,043, and $395,121, for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	The new standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or in a modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect will be recognized as of the date of adoption.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P77_S3	Additional updates to Topic 606 issued by the FASB in 2015 and 2016 include the following:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of the new guidance such that the new provisions will now be required for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Company does not intend to early adopt, and adoption will therefore occur in the fiscal year ending December 28, 2018.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance in a number of other areas.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2016-20 ), which affects narrow aspects of Topic 606 such as providing incremental guidance around contract costs.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	We currently anticipate we will adopt the new revenue standards using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	Our decision to adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on the finalization of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	We continue to make progress in evaluating all potential impacts of adopting the new revenue standards on the Company s consolidated financial statements, the materiality of which is not yet known.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	This evaluation includes monitoring the work of standard setters, including any impacts from the recently issued amendments, and considering the interpretive efforts of non-authoritative groups.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Refer to the discussion above regarding the Company s current revenue recognition policies.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Adoption of the new standards is expected to affect the manner in which the Company determines the unit of account for certain products (i.e. performance obligations), as well as the allocation of consideration (i.e. revenue) to certain obligations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	We have completed our grouping of the Company s homogenous revenue streams and are continuing to specify and allocate consideration to the associated obligations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged compared to the current accounting guidance.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment awards.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	The standard includes provisions addressing income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The Company does not intend to early adopt ASU 2016-09, rather, adoption will occur in the fiscal year ending December 30, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	ASU 2016-09 requires that tax effects from stock-based compensation be recognized in the income tax provision, as these amounts are currently recognized in additional paid-in capital.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S3	The Company believes this aspect of the standard may have a material effect on the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income in future periods.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S4	Furthermore, under ASU 2016-09, excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations, rather than as a cash flow from financing activities.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S5	The Company will apply both changes prospectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P91_S6	The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of these changes due to the dependency of these items on the underlying share price of the Company.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01 ), which narrows the scope of Topic 805 by revising the definition of a business.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single asset (or group of similar assets), the asset(s) would not represent a business in the context of Topic 805.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company does not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangible Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplify the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04 ) which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	ASU 2017-04 removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, such that a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P96_S2	ASU 2017-04 should be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, or any goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P96_S3	Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P96_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	Valuation is based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	Available-for-sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	(1) Represents impairment not related to credit for those investment securities that have been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	(2) Represents unrealized losses on investment securities that have not been determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in Other Income and the noncredit component in Other comprehensive income (loss) for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	During 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2016 were $1,283,018 and $1,252,744 respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	Approximately 64.7% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P108_S3	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no material deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P108_S4	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no material impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	The following tables display additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space, and real estate amounted to $19,657, $18,104, and $19,559 for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Certain cash balances of GEL and GC are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $113 and $259 at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $403,059.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P116_S3	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual or disclosure.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Management of the Company currently does not believe there is at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies individually and in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P118_S2	Although management considers the likelihood to be remote, an adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company settled or resolved certain matters during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, expense related to these and other defined contribution plans of $40,844, $37,489, and $29,267, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P121_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014 were significant.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P123_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P124_S2	As a result of the change in corporate structure, the Company recorded tax expense of $307,635.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P124_S3	Approximately $265,000 of this amount has been paid.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P124_S4	The remainder of the accrued tax is expected to be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	The holding company s statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the Redomestication, effective June 27, 2010, is 7.83%.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P125_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2016 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be $171,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $55,000.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P125_S2	For 2015, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $154,000 lower, or $44,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $52,000.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P125_S3	For 2014, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $197,000 lower, or $57,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $44,000.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P125_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $453,729, $403,242, and $546,790, for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above reflect $0.01, $0.02, and $0.02 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P126_S2	The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2017, at which time these tax benefits will likely expire.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Income taxes of $22,139, $21,085, and $20,606 at December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	Included in the share based compensation deferred tax asset of $29,632 are stock options that will begin to expire over the next several years.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	Given the exercise price of the options expiring over the next 12 months compared to the current market price it is possible that these options will expire unexercised, resulting in a potential increase to income tax expense.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had $5,012 of tax credit carryover compared to $3,906 at December 26, 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $5,403 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $35,843.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $22,968 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2023, $1,462 that relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between 2025 and 2026, $1,991 that relates to the United States and expires in varying amounts between 2035 and 2036, and $9,422 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 was $115,090.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014 is as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	The entire balance of net unrecognized benefits of $109,667, $93,654 and $74,205 are required to be classified as non-current at December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P134_S3	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	At December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, the Company had accrued approximately $3,901, $2,479, and $2,159, respectively, for interest.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, by $1,422, $320, and ($2,953), respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2012 and prior.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P136_S2	The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2010 and prior.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P136_S3	The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2013 and prior.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P136_S4	The Company is no longer subject to Switzerland tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2011 and prior.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $11,151, $6,971, and $83,006 in fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $15,000 to $20,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P138_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes auto, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P141_S2	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEMs.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Company s marine, auto, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P143_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	In 2015, the measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM to assess segment performance and allocate resources changed from income before income taxes to operating income.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P145_S2	This change did not impact the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss in all years presented.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses, including certain allocated general and administrative costs.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P146_S2	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P147_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	Revenues, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	In 2016 the Company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P148_S2	The overall impact of the move was immaterial.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P148_S3	However, action camera related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	Net sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	Note that APAC refers to the Asia Pacific region, and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	(1) The U.S. is the only country which constitutes greater than 10% of net sales to external customers.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	(2) Americas and APAC net assets are primarily held in the United States and Taiwan, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	For all stock compensation plans, the company s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	In June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the 2011 Directors Plan ) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	The term of each award cannot exceed ten years.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P154_S3	In 2016, 2015, and 2014, 12,984, 12,008, and 7,120 RSUs were granted under this plan.

1121788_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P157_S2	The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2016, 2015, or 2014.

1121788_17_ITEM8_P158_S3	All awards vest evenly over a three-year period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P158_S4	Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares under this plan.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	A summary of the Company s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Directors Plan for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 is provided below:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2016 was 1.21 and 1.09 years, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 31, 2016 was 1.47 years.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	The fair value of awards is determined at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	The fair value of RSUs is calculated using the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period, which are not accrued.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	The fair value of stock options and SARs was calculated with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2014.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P161_S3	No options or SARs were granted in 2016 or 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The total fair value of awards vested during 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $22,429, $23,351, and $19,127, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2016 were $942 and $884, respectively.

1121788_17_ITEM8_P163_S4	The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $27,386, $20,787, and $28,119, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P164_S1	Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Company s closing stock price was $48.49 on December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P164_S3	As of December 31, 2016, there was $55,802 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P164_S4	That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	The shareholders also adopted an ESPP.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	Up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP with shareholders approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in June 2015.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S2	Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S3	The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S4	During 2016, 2015, and 2014, 541,018, 488,753, and 349,982 shares, respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $18,157, $16,789, and $14,634, respectively.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S5	During 2016, 2015, and 2014, the purchases were issued from treasury shares.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P165_S6	At December 31, 2016, approximately 1,459,610 shares were available for future issuance.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:
1121788_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	There were 3,547,738, 4,086,983, and 2,240,005 outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units (collectively equity awards ) excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	On February 13, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares through December 31, 2016.

1121788_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	The above quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these interim periods presented have been included.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P174_S1	These results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results (the table may not foot due to rounding).
1121788_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	As a result of Switzerland corporate tax reform failing to pass on February 12, 2017, coupled with potential tax risk from evolving global tax initiatives, the Company has elected on February 20, 2017 to adjust certain Switzerland tax positions.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P175_S1	The Company expects this election to result in an estimated 300 basis points increase to the fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate compared to fiscal year 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM8_P175_S2	In addition, the Company expects to revalue certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of this election, for which the Company anticipates recording approximately $150 million of income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017.

1121788_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Based on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management s effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

1121788_17_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1121788_17_ITEM9A_P11_S0	In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Garmin s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin s engineering and manufacturing teams.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	Garmin s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered approximately 4,000 people worldwide as of December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	Garmin s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S3	Garmin s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S4	Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin s success.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P99_S5	Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Below is a table of Garmin s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	Garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	Specifically, Garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality and time to market.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	Cost: Garmin s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency, resulting in lower cost.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	Garmin s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high, mid and low volume products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	Sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects Garmin s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	The ownership and integration of our resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products, yielding improved cost.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	Quality: Garmin s automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	Garmin s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	Garmin s automotive operations in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	Garmin s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd. and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	Although most components essential to Garmin s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P108_S1	Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P110_S2	Nevertheless, if Garmin s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P110_S3	Garmin s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P110_S4	Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin s requirements.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P111_S2	Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P111_S3	Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P112_S2	We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P113_S2	In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P113_S3	For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	As of January 5, 2018, Garmin s worldwide IP portfolio included over 1,100 patent and 750 trademark registrations.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	The duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P115_S1	We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P115_S2	Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin s rights in its proprietary technologies.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P116_S1	It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P117_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P118_S1	In accordance with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P118_S2	Garmin s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P118_S3	A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin s products, or losing certification for Garmin s existing products could adversely affect our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P118_S4	In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin s operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P119_S1	The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P119_S2	Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P119_S3	Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P120_S0	Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P120_S1	Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P121_S0	The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P121_S1	The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P121_S2	A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P122_S0	Garmin s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P122_S1	Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P123_S0	Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P124_S0	Environmental regulation of Garmin s products is increasing.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P125_S0	Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P125_S1	Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P125_S2	Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	Garmin s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin s European headquarters facility, and Garmin s Taiwan and China manufacturing facilities.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	Garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	Our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete Garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P127_S2	Additionally, our new facility design has been constructed with energy efficient considerations, including reduced water consumption, LED lighting, and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	As of December 30, 2017, Garmin had approximately 12,300 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 4,700 were in North America, 5,100 were in Taiwan, 1,500 were in Europe, and 1,000 were in other global locations.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P128_S1	Except for some of Garmin s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1121788_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	Garmin considers its employee relations to be positive.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In 2017, the fitness tracker market rapidly contracted, resulting in lower sales and profits in our fitness segment.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	GPS/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in the auto segment and has reduced profits in some periods.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The auto segment, which represents approximately 24% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2018.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as PNDs became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	This has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, lower revenues and profits for this segment.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Income and expense activity in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	However, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Switzerland has agreed with the European Union (EU) to execute tax reform by 2019 in exchange for the EU s waiver of counter-measures.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	A failure to accomplish tax reform in the agreed timeframe may result in the EU member states reasserting counter-measure provisions which could result in additional tax for the Company.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Moreover, international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A significant portion of our global and U.S. sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in Taiwan and the People s Republic of China.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The imposition of additional U.S. or foreign governmental controls, regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the U.S., or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including goods imported from China and Taiwan, could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The United Kingdom (UK) is scheduled to formally leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the terms of the expected exit.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have operations in the UK and several EU member states whose currencies, namely British Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro, economies, taxation, and trade regulation, among other factors, could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the UK s leaving the EU, which is likely to be a complicated process.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These higher costs could lower our profit margins.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for specific components and map data used in our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Some components we use are from sole source suppliers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In the past, we have experienced shortages of certain components.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The largest digital map supplier for our auto products is HERE (formerly known as NAVTEQ), which is majority-owned by a consortium of Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Audi AG.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data from HERE at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement with an option to extend through 2028, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from HERE and other primary suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with primary suppliers changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other s rights or are infringed upon by others.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may become subject to significant product liability costs.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our users personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our security measures or applications are breached, disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, and a new data protection regulation in the E.U. with significant fines and penalties for noncompliance will go into effect in May 2018.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We rely on information technology systems for our business operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	These systems assist in our business processes, including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, order processing, shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	A disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P59_S6	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P60_S6	A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product s life.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P63_S5	To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Relations between Taiwan and the People s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the one-China policy.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Deviations from the one-China policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Changes in our United States federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater U.S. shareholders.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act ) signed on December 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to U.S. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-U.S. corporation (a 10% U.S. shareholder) under the U.S. Federal income tax law applicable to owners of U.S. controlled foreign corporations ( CFCs ).
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Prior to the 2017 Act, the Company did not believe we, or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, were considered a CFC, which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10% U.S. shareholders together own, or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a non-U.S. corporation.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The 2017 Act repealed Internal Revenue Code Section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries as CFCs with respect to any single 10% U.S. shareholder.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	This may be the result without regard to whether 10% U.S. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company as was the case under prior rules.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	The repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of CFCs beginning before January 1, 2018 and for the taxable year of 10% U.S. shareholders in which the CFCs' taxable year ends.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Additional tax consequences to 10% U.S. shareholders of a CFC may result from other provisions of the 2017 Act.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	For example, the 2017 Act amended Section 965 to require 10% U.S. shareholders to include in income their pro-rata share of certain earnings and profits (E P) of CFCs.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	This Section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividends-received deduction.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The 2017 Act also added Section 951A which requires a 10% U.S. shareholder of a CFC to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of the CFC.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Finally, the 2017 Act eliminated the requirement in Section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a CFC for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% U.S. shareholder to have a current income inclusion.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	From time to time, the Company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These measures could inadvertently create additional 10% U.S. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	We urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 Act revisions to the U.S. Federal income tax law applicable to owners of CFCs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers ability to sell airplanes.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S6	In addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P74_S7	Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	We do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S6	For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the United States who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P76_S7	If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our operating results are difficult to predict.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P78_S3	As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P78_S4	If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P85_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	There is uncertainty as to our shareholders ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration operations would harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Any failure of the United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System and other Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS).
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P93_S2	A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	GPS modernization software updates can cause problems.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	GPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Some of our products also use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Other countries, including China and India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use GNSS signals from these systems.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The European community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Use of non-US GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P102_S2	To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	A shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	This interference could harm our business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government s Global Positioning System satellites.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P106_S1	These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Natural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change could affect our financial results.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	If our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and/or if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	It is also possible that the U.S. Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P115_S1	During 2017, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $47.35 to a high of $62.92.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P115_S2	A variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	As of January 17, 2018, members of our Board of Directors, and our executive officers, and Gary Burrell (our co-founder and former executive officer and member of our Board of Directors), together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 39.99% of our outstanding shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P119_S2	This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd. s articles of association.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S1	The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S2	For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S3	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S4	Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S5	Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S6	For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P121_S7	These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P124_S1	A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P124_S2	However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P125_S1	However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P125_S2	Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P125_S3	No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P125_S4	However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a second trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P126_S1	However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P126_S2	No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Under Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P128_S1	We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P128_S2	The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P128_S3	We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation.
1121788_18_ITEM1A_P128_S4	Our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares has been a component of our capital management and shareholder return practices, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

1121788_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	For information on each of the following critical accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:
1121788_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan; Yangzhou manufacturing plant in China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	In recent years, pricing has stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
1121788_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):
1121788_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2016, the Company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The overall impact of the move was immaterial.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	However, action camera related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	For each line item in the table the total of the segments amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net sales increased 2% in 2017 when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Outdoor, marine, and aviation segments had an increase in revenue, while fitness and auto segments had a decrease in revenue.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 25% in 2017, which was a slight decline from 27% in 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2016 at 29% and declined to 24% in 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Total unit sales decreased 8% to 15.4 million units in the 52-weeks ended 2017 from 16.8 million units in the 53-weeks ended 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 15% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Fitness segment revenue decreased 7% from the year-ago period, primary driven by the general decline of the basic activity tracker market.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Outdoor, marine, and aviation revenues increased 28%, 13%, and 14%, respectively when compared to the year-ago period.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Growth in outdoor was driven by growth in our wearables and subscriptions categories.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	Our marine segment revenue increased primarily due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment systems, and the newly acquired Navionics.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	Aviation revenues increased due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased 3% in absolute dollars for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 when compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The auto segment cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	In the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments, the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues was a result of a shift in product mix toward higher margin products.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The aviation segment increase in cost of goods sold was generally consistent with the segment revenue increase.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Gross profit dollars in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 increased 6% while gross profit margin increased 210 basis points compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Outdoor, fitness, and marine segment increases to gross profit margin were primarily due to product mix within those segments.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Auto and aviation segment gross margin rates were relatively consistent between fiscal periods.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Advertising expense decreased 7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to decreases in spend on media advertising.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to legal-related costs and information technology costs.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a percent of revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses in all segments except marine were relatively consistent on a year over year basis.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	The increase in the marine segment, as a percent of revenues, was primarily related to a litigation settlement.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Research and development expense increased 9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of engineering personnel throughout the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $43.7 million when compared with the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, and increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	As a result of the above, operating income increased 7% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The growth in operating income, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, was primarily due to an increase in revenue growth and increase in gross margin percentage, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses, as discussed above.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The average returns on cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 and the 53- weeks ended December 31, 2016 were 1.5% for both periods.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Interest income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities, while other income decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net capital gains realized in fiscal 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The $22.6 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.4% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 14.1% against the Euro and 9.5% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The remaining net currency gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The $31.7 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our income tax benefit for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 was $12.7 million compared to income tax expense of $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a net change of $131.6 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Contributing to the decrease in tax expense was:
1121788_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Increased income tax expense of $21.0 million related to the Company s election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed by United States Congress, reducing the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	The effects of U.S. tax reform, including revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, had an immaterial impact on the 2017 income tax benefit, on a provisional basis, as discussed in Note 6.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 36% to $695.0 million for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to $510.8 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net sales increased 7% in 2016 when compared to the prior year period.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	All segments had an increase in revenue except for auto.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 29% in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to 38% in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Total unit sales increased 4% to 16.8 million units in 2016 from 16.2 million units in 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Auto segment revenue decreased 17% from the prior year period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation revenues increased 33%, 24%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in sales volumes.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Growth in outdoor was driven by wearables and the newly acquired DeLorme product lines.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	The increase in fitness was driven by wearables with Garmin Elevate TM wrist heart rate technology.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our marine segment increased due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment systems.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Aviation revenues increased due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Cost of goods sold increased 4% in absolute dollars for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	In the auto segment, the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	In the outdoor and fitness segments, the increases of 32% and 29% in cost of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	In the marine and aviation segments, the increases of 16% and 6%, respectively, primarily reflect volume growth.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gross profit dollars in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% while gross profit margin increased 100 basis points compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Fitness margin declined to 53% due to product mix.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	All other segment gross margin rates are relatively consistent between fiscal periods.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Advertising expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to outdoor and fitness, partially offset by auto.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased 4% and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to information technology costs and salaries and benefits.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues with the exception of the marine segment, as expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Research and development expense increased 10% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $40.9 million when compared with the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015, and increased 40 basis points as a percent of revenue.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	As a result of the above, operating income increased 14% in absolute dollars and 120 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Revenue growth with a slight increase in gross margin percentage contributed to the growth, slightly offset by increased operating expenses, as discussed above, with the exception of the marine segment, as operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	The average returns on cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 and the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 were 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The $31.7 million currency loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The $23.5 million currency loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% against the Euro and 4.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $31.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	This was largely offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $19.5 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	The remaining net currency loss of $9.7 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, Garmin recorded other income of $4.0 million compared to $11.4 million in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in fiscal 2016 relates primarily to a legal settlement received in fiscal 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our income tax expense increased by $7.9 million, to $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, from $111.0 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	As a result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 12% to $510.8 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to $456.2 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	As of December 30, 2017, we had $2,313.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements will be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	It is management s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately 1.6%, 1.5%, and 1.2%, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	See Note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The $44.8 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of cash provided by working capital of $133.2 million (which included increases of $52.2 million in accounts receivable and $31.5 million in cash paid for inventory) and income taxes payable of $16.5 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of $184.1 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $79.3 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The $425.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital of $223.5 million (which included decreases of $122.5 million in cash paid for inventory and $109.6 million in cash paid for prepaid royalties and other assets) and income taxes payable of $154.0 million, primarily attributable to cash taxes paid related to a 2015 intercompany restructuring.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase was also impacted by an increase of net income of $54.6 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $6.9 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	The $73.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to increased cash payments for net purchases of property and equipment of $49.1 million and net cash paid for acquisitions of $12.5 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The $9.6 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased net cash paid for acquisitions of $39.3 million and net purchases of property and equipment of $17.6 million, partially offset by an increase of $49.0 million in net redemptions of marketable securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have budgeted approximately $140 million to $150 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Approximately half of the budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are attributable to Olathe, KS facilities, including the expansion project described in Item 2.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The $113.3 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to decreased dividend payments of $98.5 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of $18.7 million under our share repurchase authorization.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	The $61.6 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased dividend payments of $103.3 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and the year-over-year increase of our dividend rate, partially offset by a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of $38.2 million under our share repurchase authorization.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our declared dividend has increased from $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the twelve calendar quarters beginning in June 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 30, 2017, operating leases comprise the substance of the Company s commercial commitments with long-term scheduled payments, as summarized below:
1121788_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company is party to certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 30, 2017 was approximately $313.4 million.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $130.8 million as of December 30, 2017, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P73_S3	For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
1121788_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The operation of Garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. Dollars.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During fiscal year 2017, the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $22.6 million, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.4% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 14.1% against the Euro and 9.5% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The remaining net currency gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P9_S3	These and other currency moves during fiscal year 2017 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $88.3 million within accumulated other comprehensive income.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $96 million and $92 million at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The Company s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P13_S2	During 2017 and 2016, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P14_S0	We assessed the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company s portfolio of marketable securities.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Based on balance sheet positions as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $42 million and $45 million at December 30, 2017 and December 30, 2016, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P3_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1990.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the Company ) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company s products to the Company s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company s products in Asia and the Far East.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company s research and new product development.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	GII also manufactures most of the Company s products in the aviation segment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Many of GEL s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	At the Company s Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved the cancellation of 10,000,000 registered shares of the Company held by the Company (the Formation Shares ) and the reduction in par value of each share of the Company from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company s Articles of Association to effect a corresponding share capital reduction.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company s fiscal year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year, and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	Therefore, the financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2016 included 53 weeks.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P12_S3	Cumulative currency translation adjustments of $78,909 and ($9,411) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling typically have offsetting impacts on operating income when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $22,579, $31,651, and $23,465 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	The loss in fiscal 2017 was due primarily to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, which was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	The loss in fiscal 2016 was due primarily to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P15_S4	The loss in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, which was partially offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive share-based compensation awards has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise or release at the average market price of the Company s stock during the period the awards were outstanding.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S3	Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S4	The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S5	The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P18_S6	Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management s expectations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company s top ten customers have contributed between 22% and 24% of net sales since 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	None of the Company s customers accounted for more than or equal to 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	(1) Inventory balances by major class of inventory as of December 31, 2016 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	As required by the Property, Plant and Equipment topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Intangibles Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 350) requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company performs its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	ASC Topic 350 allows management to first perform a qualitative assessment ( step zero ) by assessing the qualitative factors of relevant events and circumstances at the reporting unit level to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test ( step one ).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	If factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the step one assessment will be performed.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P28_S4	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount in step one then goodwill impairment will be recognized and the charge is determined through the step two analysis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Each of the Company s operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness) represents a distinct reporting unit.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The auto PND market has declined in recent years as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	This has resulted in periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company s auto PND reporting unit.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Considering these qualitative factors, management performed a step one quantitative goodwill impairment assessment of the auto PND reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	Management determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount, and a step two analysis was therefore not performed.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S4	However, considering the uncertainty of future operating results and/or market conditions deteriorating faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in management s estimation of fair value, management believes some or all of the approximately $80 million of goodwill associated with the Company s auto PND reporting unit is at risk of future impairment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P30_S5	Management concluded that no other reporting units are currently at risk of impairment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company did not recognize any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2017, 2016, or 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years .
1121788_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company s shareholders.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	On June 9, 2017, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.53 was paid in the Company s 2017 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2017 in the amount of $382,976.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	On June 10, 2016, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.53 was paid in the Company s 2016 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2016 in the amount of $481,452.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	On June 5, 2015, the shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.02 was paid in the Company's 2015 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The dates determined by the Board were as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company paid dividends in 2015 in the amount of $378,117.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately $304,674 of retained earnings was indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	At December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $316,705 and $253,473, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Accumulated amortization was $193,886 and $173,023 at December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $20,863, $14,319, and $7,115 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P42_S3	In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $18,796, $16,293, $14,167, $10,463, and $8,111, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $286,982 at December 30, 2017, and $224,553 at December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	All of the Company s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	At December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, cumulative unrealized net losses of $22,864 and $27,350, respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	If investments are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	Such amortization is included in interest income from investments.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic Income Taxes .
1121788_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company recognizes liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	If the Company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Income taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	For the large majority of the Company s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products including mobile applications, in-dash navigation solutions, incremental navigation and/or communication service subscriptions, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element arrangements that are individually immaterial.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company offers PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	In addition, the Company offers PNDs with traffic service bundled in the original purchase price.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	The remaining deliverables are the LMU and/or traffic service.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU and/or the traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the products.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company has determined sufficient VSOE does not exist for LMU or traffic, and that third party evidence of selling price is not available as stand-alone and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Therefore, the Company uses the royalty cost plus a normal margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative selling prices of the LMU and traffic elements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	For multiple-element software arrangements that do not include a tangible product, the Company allocates revenue to the various elements based on VSOE.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	When VSOE cannot be established for undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until the earlier point at which all elements of the arrangement are delivered or sufficient VSOE does exist, unless the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	If the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support, the entire arrangement consideration is recognized ratably over the support period.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Company offers navigation software licenses to certain customers, bundled with map updates to be provided periodically over the support period.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P62_S4	The Company has determined sufficient VSOE of similar map updates does not exist for certain arrangements, and therefore revenue from these transactions is recognized ratably over the contractual map update period.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company s operating results.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S4	These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P63_S5	If market conditions were to decline, the Company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	At December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $303,521 and $286,971, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $122,162 and $103,546, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives, typically one to five years, on a straight-line basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	In the next five years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $91,370, $48,627, $25,340, $11,208, and $4,814, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged or defective.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Company s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S3	The Company s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation and auto OEM products have a warranty period of two years or more from the date of installation .
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S4	The Company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S5	To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P67_S6	The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty accrual:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	(1) Changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties are not material and aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the accrual for products sold line .
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S4	Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the product, or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P69_S5	These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Advertising expense amounted to approximately $164,693, $177,143, and $167,166 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	A majority of the Company s research and development is performed in the United States.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $511,634, $467,960, and $427,043 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	The technical support is typically provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	The related cost of providing this free support is not material.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Software requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company currently sponsors four stock-based employee compensation plans.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management s estimates.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment awards.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the quarter ended April 1, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation to be recognized in the income tax provision.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	We previously recorded these amounts to additional paid-in capital.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are not estimated in the effective tax rate, rather, are recorded as discrete tax items in the period they occur.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S5	Excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations under ASU 2016-09, rather than as a cash flow from financing activities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P77_S6	The most significant impact of ASU 2016-09 during the fiscal year ending December 30, 2017 was the recognition of income tax expense of $22,620 resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights expiring unexercised in the second and fourth quarters.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The FASB has issued several standards amending or relating to ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the new revenue standard ).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	The effective date of ASU 2014-09 is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	The Company has adopted the new revenue standard in the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year ending December 29, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which will require the Company to restate each prior reporting period presented in future financial statement issuances.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company has evaluated Topic 606, and has assessed existing and historical contracts to identify possible differences in the timing of revenue recognition under the new revenue standard.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	During this evaluation, both senior management and the Audit Committee have been updated as to progress and findings on a frequent basis.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	Based on our evaluation of the new revenue standard, our recognition will be consistent with our historical accounting policies except for certain arrangements within the Company s auto segment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	A portion of the Company s auto segment contracts have historically been accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 985-605 Software-Revenue Recognition (Topic 985-605).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	Under Topic 985-605, the Company deferred revenue and associated costs of all elements of multiple-element software arrangements if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) could not be established for an undelivered element (e.g. map updates).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	In applying the new revenue standard to certain contracts that include both software licenses and map updates, we will recognize the portion of revenue and costs related to the software license at the time of delivery rather than ratably over the map update period.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Additionally, for certain multiple-element arrangements within the Company s auto segment, the Company s policy has been to allocate consideration to traffic services and recognize the revenue and associated cost of royalties ratably over the estimated life of the underlying product.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	Under the new revenue standard, we will recognize revenue and associated costs of royalties related to certain traffic services at the time of hardware and/or software delivery.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	Specifically, the new revenue standard emphasize the timing of the Company s performance, and upon delivery of the navigation device and/or software, the Company has performed its obligation with respect to the design and production of the product to receive and interpret the broadcast traffic signal for the benefit of the end user.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The changes in accounting policy described above collectively result in reductions to deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) balances, and accelerate the recognition of revenues and deferred costs in the auto segment going forward.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	Summarized financial information depicting the impact of the new revenue standard follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	(1) Effective for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2018, we have adopted ASC Topic 606.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	The balances above are restated under ASC Topic 606.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company s historical net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities are not impacted by adoption of the new revenue standard.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	The Company will adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged compared to the current accounting guidance.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	The Company will adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position of results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory ( ASU 2016-16 ), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	Callable debt securities held at a discount continue to be amortized to maturity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	ASU 2017-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2018-02 ), which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to be reclassified to retained earnings.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P94_S3	The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The FASB ASC topic entitled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1121788_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	Valuation is based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	The method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Available-for-sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in Other Income and the noncredit component in Other comprehensive income (loss) for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	During 2017 and 2016, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 30, 2017 were $1,348,777 and $1,323,807 respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	Approximately 80% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no material deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P104_S4	We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no material impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following tables display additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at December 30, 2017, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	Rental expense related to office, equipment, warehouse space, and real estate amounted to $18,915, $19,657, and $18,104 for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	Certain cash balances, primarily of GEL and GC, are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	The total amount of restricted cash balances were $271 and $113 at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 30, 2017 was approximately $313,385.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company evaluates, on a quarterly and annual basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations, claims, and other loss contingencies that could affect any required accrual or disclosure or estimate of reasonably possible loss or range of loss.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P113_S3	If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P113_S4	If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	If an outcome unfavorable to the Company is determined to be probable, but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated or is determined to be reasonably possible, but not probable, we disclose the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	The Company s aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, and a liability therefore has not been accrued.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	This aggregate range only represents the Company s estimate of reasonably possible losses and does not represent the Company s maximum loss exposure.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	In assessing the probability of an outcome in a lawsuit, claim or assessment that could be unfavorable to the Company, we consider the following factors, among others: a) the nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment; b) the progress of the case; c) the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers; d) our experience in similar cases; e) the experience of other entities in similar cases; and f) how we intend to respond to the lawsuit, claim, or assessment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	Costs incurred in defending lawsuits, claims or assessments are expensed as incurred.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Management of the Company currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	An adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	On January 24, 2018, Garmin and Navico agreed on a global settlement of all pending litigation between them, pursuant to which it is expected that all related claims will be dismissed with prejudice or terminated, including those for which the Company had previously disclosed a reasonably possible loss.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	The settlement is not material to the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P119_S2	The parties have agreed to keep the terms of the settlement confidential.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P119_S3	The Company also settled or resolved certain other matters during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	GII and the Company s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	During the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, expense related to these and other defined contribution plans of $43,826, $40,844, and $37,489, respectively, was charged to operations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P121_S2	Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 were significant.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	In the year ended December 30, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $180,034 as a result of the Company s February 2017 election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with evolving international tax initiatives.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company s statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the Redomestication, effective June 27, 2010, is 7.83%.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2017 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $186,000 lower, or $53,600, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $77,000.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	For 2016, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $171,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $55,000.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P125_S3	For 2015, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $154,000 lower, or $44,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $52,000.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P125_S4	All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Company s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $461,436, $453,729, and $403,242, for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	Income taxes of $20,287, $22,139, and $21,085 at December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	At December 30, 2017, the Company had $8,413 of tax credit carryover compared to $5,012 at December 31, 2016.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	At December 30, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $8,799 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $70,419.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	Included in the NOL carryforwards is $43,210 that relates to Switzerland and expires in varying amounts between 2023 and 2024, $1,757 that relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between 2025 and 2027, $10,610 that relates to the United States and various state jurisdictions and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and 2037, $5,234 that relates to the Netherlands and expires in 2026 and $9,608 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law in the United States.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	The new tax legislation contains several provisions that will impact the Company, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, acceleration of business asset expensing, and a reduction in the amount of executive pay that may qualify as a tax deduction, among others.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P132_S2	The decrease in the corporate income tax rate will require the Company to remeasure its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as reassess the realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	FASB ASC 740 requires the recognition of the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	However, due to the complexities of the new tax legislation, the SEC has issued SAB 118 which allows for the recognition of provisional amounts during a measurement period similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	The Company has recorded a provisional re-measurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in an immaterial impact on its 2017 income tax provision.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P133_S3	The Company will continue to assess the impact of the new tax legislation, as well as any related future regulations and rules, and will record any additional impacts as identified during the measurement period, if necessary.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P133_S4	The Company does not expect any such potential adjustments in the future periods will materially impact the Company s financial condition or result of operations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2017 was $130,798.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 is as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as noncurrent liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	The entire balance of net unrecognized benefits of $127,306, $109,667 and $93,654 are required to be classified as noncurrent at December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P135_S2	The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P135_S3	None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	At December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, the Company had accrued approximately $5,605, $3,901, and $2,479, respectively, for interest.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P136_S2	The interest component of the reserve increased income tax expense for the years ending December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, by $1,704, $1,422, and $320 respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P136_S3	The Company did not have significant amounts accrued for penalties for the years ending December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland, U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	In its major tax jurisdictions, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and U.S. federal and various states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities, with few exceptions, for years prior to 2013, 2012, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $17,918, $11,151, and $6,971 in fiscal years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $20,000 to $25,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	As required by the Financial Instruments topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P140_S1	None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P140_S2	The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1121788_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	The Company has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes auto, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P142_S1	There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P142_S2	Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	All of the Company s reportable segments offer products through the Company s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEMs.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company s marine, auto, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P144_S1	These products are produced primarily by the Company s subsidiary in Taiwan.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	The CODM uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses, including certain allocated general and administrative costs.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P147_S2	There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	Revenues, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company s reportable segments are presented below.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	In 2016 the Company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P149_S2	The overall impact of the move was immaterial.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P149_S3	However, action camera related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation.

1121788_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	(1) The U.S. is the only country which constitutes greater than 10% of net sales to external customers.
1121788_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	(2) Americas and APAC net assets are primarily held in the United States and Taiwan, respectively.

1121788_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1121788_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
