764401_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	( PC strand ) and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ) products, including concrete pipe reinforcement ( CPR ), ESM and standard welded wire reinforcement ( SWWR ).
764401_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our products are primarily sold to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction.
764401_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	For fiscal 2011, we estimate that approximately 90% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 10% were related to residential construction.
764401_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), its operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate nine manufacturing facilities that are located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our growth initiatives are focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our exit from the industrial wire business in June 2006 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) was the last in a series of divestitures which served to narrow our strategic and operational focus to concrete reinforcing products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	The results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain of the assets of Ivy Steel and Wire, Inc.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	( Ivy ) for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; the production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S4	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S5	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_11_ITEM1_P4_S6	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.

764401_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Products Our concrete reinforcing products consist of PC strand and WWR.
764401_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	PC strand is a high strength seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	For 2011, 2010 and 2009, PC strand sales represented 38%, 48% and 47%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including CPR, ESM and SWWR.
764401_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a replacement for hot-rolled rebar due to the cost advantages that it offers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	For 2011, 2010 and 2009, WWR sales represented 62%, 52% and 53%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Marketing and Distribution We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our sales force is organized by product line and trained in the technical applications of our products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our products are sold nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, and delivered primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and scheduling requirements.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Customers We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors and rebar fabricators.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	In fiscal 2011, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors and rebar fabricators.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as a high percentage of our customers sell into both the nonresidential and residential construction sectors.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	There were no customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S4	Backlog Backlog is not a significant measurement for our business because of the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P13_S5	We believe that the majority of our firm orders existing on October 1, 2011 will be shipped prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
764401_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications and actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, although we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Seasonality and Cyclicality Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, the highest level of shipments within the year typically occurs when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, the level of construction activity tends to be correlated with general economic conditions although there can be significant differences between the relative performance of the nonresidential versus residential construction sectors for extended periods.
764401_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Raw Materials The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our end products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Pricing for wire rod tends to fluctuate based on both domestic and global market conditions.
764401_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 represented approximately 15% and 29%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	We believe that the substantial volume and desirable mix of grades represented by our wire rod requirements constitutes a competitive advantage by making us a more attractive customer to our suppliers relative to our competitors.
764401_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Domestic wire rod producers have invested heavily in recent years to improve their quality capabilities and augment their product mix by increasing the proportion of higher value-added products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	This evolution toward higher value-added products has generally benefited us in our sourcing of wire rod for PC strand as this grade is more metallurgically and technically sophisticated.
764401_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	At the same time, domestic producers have deemphasized the production of the less sophisticated, low carbon grades of wire rod due to the more intense competitive conditions that prevail in this market.
764401_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	As a result, we typically rely more heavily on imports for supplies of lower grade wire rod.
764401_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Historically, when traditional offshore suppliers have withdrawn from the domestic market following the filing of trade cases by the domestic industry, new suppliers have filled the resulting gaps in supply.
764401_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	These laws generally require a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_11_ITEM1_P22_S4	However, the timing of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The relative supply and demand conditions in our markets determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	During fiscal 2009, wire rod prices collapsed in response to the recessionary conditions in the economy and resulting inventory imbalances that developed throughout the supply chain, which led to a dramatic decline in demand for steel products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Consequently, selling prices for our products also declined through most of fiscal 2009 in response to the weakening in demand, resulting in inventory write-downs as we reduced inventory carrying values to reflect the decrease in estimated net realizable values.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In July and September 2009, two U.S. rod mills representing over 20% of total domestic capacity closed in response to the weak market conditions.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Wire rod prices increased through most of fiscal 2010 due to the escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers before moderating later in the year as a result of the weakening demand environment.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Competitive pricing pressures intensified over the course of the year, which resulted in narrowing spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	One of the U.S. rod mills that closed operations during fiscal 2009 resumed production in early 2011which enhanced our sourcing alternatives in that the mill is located in close proximity to a number of our manufacturing facilities.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	During fiscal 2011, wire rod prices increased through most of the year driven by the continued escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers and increased demand from non-construction applications before moderating towards the end of the year.
764401_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	Competitive pricing pressures remained intense through the year due to the ongoing weakness in our construction end-markets.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Competition The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Steel Wire Co. and Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	Market participants compete on the basis of price, quality and service.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc., Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc. and Concrete Reinforcements Inc.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S5	Our primary competitors for PC strand are American Spring Wire Corporation, Sumiden Wire Products Corporation and Strand-Tech Martin, Inc.
764401_11_ITEM1_P26_S6	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We believe that we are the largest domestic producer of PC strand and WWR.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Technology has become a critical factor in remaining competitive from the standpoint of conversion costs and quality.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	In view of our sophisticated information systems, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low cost production capabilities, strong market positions, and broad product offering and geographic reach, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	Employees As of October 1, 2011, we employed 725 people.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S5	We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
764401_11_ITEM1_P27_S6	However, should we experience a disruption of production, we have contingency plans in place that we believe would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.
764401_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Financial Information For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business and geographic areas, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Environmental Matters We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
764401_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Executive Officers of the Company Our executive officers are as follows:
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Vice President and General Manager of IWP H. O. Woltz III, 55, was elected Chief Executive Officer in 1991and has been employed by us and our subsidiaries in various capacities since 1978.
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	He was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1989.
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	He served as our Vice President from 1988 to 1989 and as President of Rappahannock Wire Company, formerly a subsidiary of our Company, from 1981 to 1989.
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Mr. Woltz has been a Director since 1986 and also serves as President of Insteel Wire Products Company.
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S4	Mr. Woltz served as President of Florida Wire and Cable, Inc. until its merger with Insteel Wire Products Company in 2002.
764401_11_ITEM1_P31_S5	Mr. Woltz serves on the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Michael C. Gazmarian, 52, was elected Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in February 2007.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	He had previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since 1994, the year he joined us.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Gazmarian had been employed by Guardian Industries Corp., a privately-held manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products, since 1986, serving in various financial capacities.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	James F. Petelle, 61 , joined us in October 2006.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	He was elected Vice President and Assistant Secretary on November 14, 2006 and Vice President Administration and Secretary on January 12, 2007.
764401_11_ITEM1_P32_S5	He was previously employed by Andrew Corporation, a publicly-held manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, having served as Secretary from 1990 to May 2006, and Vice President - Law from 2000 to October 2006.
764401_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Richard T. Wagner, 52, joined us in 1992 and has served as Vice President and General Manager of the Concrete Reinforcing Products Business Unit of the Company s subsidiary, Insteel Wire Products Company, since 1998.
764401_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Prior to 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products, since 1977.
764401_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 8, 2011 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 21, 2012.
764401_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities.
764401_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.
764401_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets.
764401_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	2011 could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of construction activity resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_11_ITEM1_P37_S5	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S5	Current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S6	Further, the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S7	The continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S8	Demand for our products could be significantly impacted by the timing in resolving a new federal transportation funding authorization and the magnitude of the infrastructure-related funding that is provided for requiring the use of our products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S9	The previous federal transportation funding authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in September 2009 and has subsequently been extended through a series of interim measures, the most recent of which expires in March 2012.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S10	The additional federal funding provided for under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) has not had a significant impact on the demand for our products as a high proportion of the projects funded have been for pavement resurfacing and repairs, which do not require the use of our products, and any favorable impact has been offset by reduced spending at the state and local government level due to fiscal constraints.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S11	Failure to enact a new multi-year federal funding authorization in a timely manner could have a negative impact on demand for our products.
764401_11_ITEM1_P38_S12	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2011.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory, as we experienced during certain periods of fiscal 2009 and 2010.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S5	Trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_11_ITEM1_P40_S6	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	We may not be successful in fully realizing the anticipated synergies from the Ivy Acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	Although we essentially completed the integration of the Ivy Acquisition during fiscal 2011 and are realizing a substantial portion of the anticipated synergies, there could be delays, disruptions or other unexpected challenges arise in connection with the completion of the remaining reconfiguration activities at certain of the Ivy facilities.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	If these delays, disruptions or other challenges occur and not be effectively resolved, we could fail to realize the remainder of the anticipated synergies from the Ivy Acquisition which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S4	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand.
764401_11_ITEM1_P42_S5	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	In 2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_11_ITEM1_P43_S4	The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S4	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S5	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P44_S6	Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	In March 2010, Congress passed and the President signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	This legislation may have a significant impact on health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	If the implementation of this legislation significantly increases the costs attributable to our self-insured health plans, it may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S5	Although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S6	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S7	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S8	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S9	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $75.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S10	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_11_ITEM1_P45_S11	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	During fiscal 2011, our common stock traded as high as $15.10 and as low as $8.22.
764401_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, several of which are beyond our control, including: variations in our quarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	October 1, 2011, we operated nine manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_11_ITEM1B_P0_S1	We own all of our real estate with the exception of a non-operating facility located in Houston, Texas, which is leased from Ivy through November 2011.
764401_11_ITEM1B_P0_S2	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_11_ITEM1B_P0_S3	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate for the current and projected needs for our existing products.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	ODOT, which allegedly could have been in excess of $8.3 million, plus $2.7 million in damages allegedly incurred by DSI.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In 2009, the Ohio court granted our motion for summary judgment as to the third-party claim against us on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, but DSI filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	In addition, we previously filed a lawsuit against DSI in the North Carolina Superior Court in Surry County seeking recovery of $1.4 million (plus interest) owed for other products sold by us to DSI, which action was removed by DSI to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	On October 7, 2010, we participated in a structured mediation with ODOT and DSI which led to settlement of all of the above legal matters.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	The parties dismissed the action in the Middle District of North Carolina on December 23, 2010, and the Ohio Court of Claims action was dismissed on January 21, 2011.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	Pursuant to the settlement agreement, which was approved by the Ohio Court of Claims on January 5, 2011, the parties released each other from all liability arising out of the sale of strand for the bridge project.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	In connection with the settlement, we reserved the remaining outstanding balance that we were owed by DSI and agreed to make a cash payment of $600,000 to ODOT.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S7	During fiscal 2011, we paid the $600,000 settlement to ODOT and wrote off the DSI receivables against the previously established reserve.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S8	The resolution of this matter has enabled us to restore our commercial relationship with DSI that had existed prior to the initiation of the legal proceedings.
764401_11_ITEM3_P0_S9	Our fiscal 2010 results reflect a $1.5 million charge relating to the net effect of the settlement.
764401_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are also, from time to time, involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_11_ITEM4_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_11_ITEM4_P0_S1	As of November 2, 2011, there were 910 shareholders of record.
764401_11_ITEM4_P1_S0	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividend per share declared in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010: On November 18, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to buy back up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S0	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S1	We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence or suspend the program at any time at our discretion without prior notice.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S2	The share repurchase authorization continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S3	As of October 1, 2011, there was $24.8 million remaining available for future share repurchases under this authorization.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S4	During 2011 and 2010, we repurchased $143,000 or 12,633 shares and $79,000 or 8,486 shares, respectively, of our common stock through restricted stock net-share settlements.
764401_11_ITEM4_P2_S5	The following table summarizes the repurchases of common stock during the quarter ended October 1, 2011:
764401_11_ITEM4_P3_S0	(1) Under the $25.0 million share repurchase authorization announced on November 18, 2008, which continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_11_ITEM4_P4_S0	(2) Represents 5,876 shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.
764401_11_ITEM4_P5_S0	In July 2005, we resumed our quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_11_ITEM4_P5_S1	On August 12, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a special cash dividend of $0.50 per share that was paid on October 3, 2008.
764401_11_ITEM4_P5_S2	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_11_ITEM4_P5_S3	See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to dividend payments.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S0	On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, effective April 25, 2009, amending the Rights Agreement dated as of April 27, 1999 between us and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, successor to First Union National Bank.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S1	No. 1 and the Rights Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Rights Agreement.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S2	In connection with adopting the Rights Agreement, on April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S3	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S4	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us on certain dates described in the Rights Agreement one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement.
764401_11_ITEM4_P6_S5	For more information regarding our Rights Agreement, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted and retrospectively applied new accounting guidance related to the calculation of earnings per share which resulted in the following reductions in basic and diluted earnings per share:
764401_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. Overview Following our exit from the industrial wire business (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
764401_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain of the assets of Ivy for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; the production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such, are excluded from revenue.
764401_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position, cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized during the period incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.
764401_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur.
764401_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant.
764401_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The compensation cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant.
764401_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	rates that determine the stock options fair value.
764401_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	These key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
764401_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We account for our defined employee benefit plans, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ) and the supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits.
764401_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.
764401_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	The discount rate for the Delaware Plan and SERPs was 4.75%, 5.25% and 5.50% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
764401_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations.
764401_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	We regularly review our actual asset allocation and, when appropriate, rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation.
764401_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	For 2011, 2010 and 2009, the assumed long-term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the Delaware Plan was 8%.
764401_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	We currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long-term return on plan assets in 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	In determining the appropriateness of this assumption, we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets, the current and projected asset mix, our investment objectives and information provided by our third-party investment advisors.
764401_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually.
764401_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss.
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains.
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	Under GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees).
764401_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above.
764401_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the Delaware Plan are reasonable and appropriate.
764401_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The funding requirements for the Delaware Plan are based upon applicable regulations, and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under ASC Topic 715 for financial reporting purposes.
764401_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	During 2011, we made contributions totaling $478,000 to the Delaware Plan.
764401_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	No contributions were required to be made to the Delaware Plan during 2010 and 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	We currently expect net periodic pension costs for 2012 to be $772,000 for the Delaware Plan and $68,000 for the SERPs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	Cash contributions to the plans during 2012 are expected to be $265,000 for the Delaware Plan and $244,000 for the SERPs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the Delaware Plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 1, 2011 by approximately $82,000 and have no impact to the expected net periodic pension cost for 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 1, 2011 by approximately $209,000 and $163,000, respectively, and increased the net periodic pension cost for 2012 by approximately $19,000.
764401_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for 2012 by approximately $4,000.
764401_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued an update that clarifies the guidance provided in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , regarding the disclosure requirements for the pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings related to a business combination.
764401_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	We elected to early adopt this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
764401_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an update that amends the guidance provided in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income , by requiring that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	This update becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
764401_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an update that amends the guidance provided in ASC Topic 820 , Fair Value Measurement , by clarifying some existing concepts, eliminating wording differences between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), and in some limited cases, changing some principles to achieve convergence between GAAP and IFRS.
764401_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The update results in a consistent definition of fair value, establishes common requirements for the measurement of and disclosure about fair value between GAAP and IFRS, and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	This update becomes effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Results of Operations Statements of Operations Selected Data (Dollars in thousands) 2011 Compared with 2010 Net Sales Net sales increased 59.2% to $336.9 million in 2011 from $211.6 million in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Shipments for the year increased 33.7% and average selling prices increased 17.7% from the prior year levels.
764401_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to the addition of the Ivy facilities in the current year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented during the current year to recover higher raw material costs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit for 2011 was $31.7 million, or 9.4% of net sales, compared to $18.0 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to the addition of the Ivy facilities in the current year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Gross profit for the current year benefited from higher spreads between selling prices and raw material costs partially offset by the sale of the higher cost inventory acquired from Ivy that was valued at fair value in accordance with purchase accounting requirements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	Gross profit for the prior year includes a $1.9 million charge for inventory write-downs to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs resulting from reduced operating schedules.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) increased 22.4% to $19.6 million, or 5.8% of net sales in 2011 from $16.0 million, or 7.6% of net sales in 2010 primarily due to staffing additions ($1.3 million) and other transition-related costs ($151,000) largely related to the Ivy Acquisition, the relative year-over-year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($595,000) and increases in stock-based compensation ($638,000), employee benefit costs ($312,000), travel expense ($239,000) and professional services costs ($167,000).
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S6	The cash surrender of life insurance policies decreased $265,000 in the current year compared with an increase of $330,000 in the prior year due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S7	The increase in stock-based compensation expense was largely due to the full vesting of awards for plan participants that became retirement eligible in the current year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S8	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily related to higher employee medical expense during the current year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S9	These increases in SG A expense were partially offset by a net gain on the settlement of life insurance policies ($357,000) and a reduction in legal expenses ($393,000) primarily due to the prior year costs associated with the PC strand trade cases.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S10	Restructuring Charges, Net Net restructuring charges of $8.3 million were recorded in 2011, including $3.8 million for impairment charges related to plant closures and the decommissioning of equipment, $2.3 million for employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions, $1.2 million for equipment relocation costs, $533,000 for the future lease obligations associated with the closed Houston, Texas facility and $464,000 for facility closure costs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S11	The plant closure costs were incurred in connection with the consolidation of our Texas and Northeast operations, which involved the closure of facilities in Houston, Texas and Wilmington, Delaware, and the absorption of the business by other Insteel facilities.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S12	The plant closure costs are net of a $1.6 million gain on the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S13	The employee separation costs were related to the staffing reductions that were implemented across our sales, administration and manufacturing support functions to address the redundancies resulting from the Ivy Acquisition and in connection with the plant closures.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S14	The Company currently expects the remainder of the restructuring activities to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S15	Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of $3.5 million were incurred in 2011 for the advisory, accounting, legal and other professional fees directly related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S16	The accounting requirements for business combinations require the expensing of acquisition costs in the period in which they are incurred.
764401_11_ITEM7_P36_S17	We do not expect to incur any additional acquisition costs related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Bargain Purchase Gain A bargain purchase gain of $500,000 was recorded in 2011 based on the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Ivy Acquisition over the purchase price.
764401_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Interest Expense Interest expense for 2011 increased $505,000 or 111.5% to $958,000 from $453,000 in 2010 primarily due to the interest on the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition, which was partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized financing costs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on continuing operations for 2011 was distorted by the impact of changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses and tax credits that we do not expect to realize.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The effective income tax rate for the prior year was (9.0%) which reflects the favorable impact of a $500,000 increase in a tax refund as the result of changes in the federal tax regulations regarding the carryback of net operating losses partially offset by $200,000 of net reserves recorded pertaining to known tax exposures in accordance with ASC 740 together with changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to lower non-deductible life insurance expense.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The loss from continuing operations for 2011 was $387,000 ($0.02 per share) compared with earnings of $458,000 ($0.03 per share) in 2010 with the year-over-year change primarily due to the restructuring charges and acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Ivy Acquisition and higher SG A expense partially offset by the increase in gross profit and the bargain purchase gain.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Earnings From Discontinued Operations Earnings from discontinued operations were $15,000 in the prior year, which had no effect on earnings per share, and were primarily related to the gain on the sale of the real estate associated with the industrial wire business partially offset by facility-related costs incurred prior to the sale and income tax expense.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	The net loss for 2011 was $387,000 ($0.02 per share) compared with earnings of $473,000 ($0.03 per share) in 2010 with the year-over-year change primarily due to the restructuring charges and acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Ivy Acquisition and higher SG A expense partially offset by the increase in gross profit and the bargain purchase gain.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	2010 Compared with 2009 Net Sales Net sales decreased 8.1% to $211.6 million in 2010 from $230.2 million in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	Shipments for the year increased 5.6% while average selling prices declined 12.9% from the prior year levels.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	The increase in shipments during 2010 was primarily driven by customer inventory restocking together with the favorable effect of the PC strand trade cases against China, which partially offset the negative effect of the reduced level of construction activity.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S8	The year-over-year increase in shipments was relative to severely depressed volumes in the prior year resulting from the recessionary conditions in the economy, reduced level of construction activity and inventory destocking measures that were pursued by our customers.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S9	The decrease in average selling prices was due to lower raw material costs and competitive pricing pressures resulting from the weak market environment.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S10	Gross Profit (Loss) Gross profit for 2010 was $18.0 million, or 8.5% of net sales compared to a gross loss of $15.1 million, or (6.6%) of net sales in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S11	Gross profit (loss) includes charges of $2.3 million in 2010 and $25.9 million in 2009 for inventory write-downs to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market resulting from declining selling prices for certain products relative to higher raw material costs under the first in, first-out ( FIFO ) method of accounting.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S12	Gross profit (loss) for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes, compressed spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs, and elevated unit conversion costs resulting from reduced operating schedules.
764401_11_ITEM7_P38_S13	The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to lower inventory write-downs in 2010, higher shipments and spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs, and lower unit conversion costs resulting from higher production volumes.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) decreased 7.1% to $16.0 million, or 7.6% of net sales in 2010 from $17.2 million, or 7.5% of net sales in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease was primarily due to increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($557,000) together with reductions in consulting expense ($207,000), employee benefit costs ($172,000), bad debt expense ($154,000), payroll taxes ($115,000), and labor expense ($102,000).
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	The cash surrender value of life insurance polices increased $330,000 during 2010 compared with a decrease of $227,000 in the prior year due to the related changes in value of the underlying investments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	The decreases in consulting and labor expense were primarily due to the implementation of various cost reduction measures.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	The reduction in employee benefit costs was primarily due to lower employee medical expense during 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S5	The decrease in payroll taxes was due to the taxes incurred associated with the payment of the fiscal 2008 employee incentive plan bonuses during the prior year.
764401_11_ITEM7_P39_S6	These reductions were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense ($222,000) in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Legal Settlement In 2010, we recorded a $1.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of litigation with a customer.
764401_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The charge included the write-off of the remaining outstanding balance that was owed to us by the customer and certain cash payments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest Expense Interest expense for 2010 decreased $188,000, or 29.3%, to $453,000 from $641,000 in 2009 primarily due to prior year borrowings on our revolver and lower amortization of capitalized financing costs in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Interest Income Interest income for 2010 decreased $42,000, or 29.2%, to $102,000 from $144,000 in 2009 primarily due to lower rates of return on cash investments in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on continuing operations decreased to (9.0%) in 2010 from 36.0% in 2009 primarily due to changes in the federal tax regulations regarding the carry-back of net operating losses, which increased the anticipated tax refund related to the prior year loss by $500,000.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	The favorable impact from the increase in the tax refund was partially offset by $200,000 of net reserves that were recorded pertaining to known tax exposures in accordance with ASC 740 together with changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S4	Earnings (Loss) From Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations for 2010 were $458,000 ($0.03 per diluted share) compared with a loss from continuing operations of $20.9 million ($1.20 per share) in 2009 due to the increase in gross profit and decrease in SG A expense, which was partially offset by the litigation settlement in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S5	Earnings (Loss) From Discontinued Operations Earnings from discontinued operations for 2010 were $15,000, which had no effect on earnings per share compared with a loss of $1.1 million ($0.07 per share) in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S6	The earnings for 2010 were primarily due to the gain on the sale of the real estate associated with the industrial wire business, which was partially offset by facility-related costs that were incurred prior to the sale together with income tax expense.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S7	The prior year loss was primarily due to a $1.8 million impairment charge to write down the carrying value of the real estate that was subsequently sold in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P41_S8	Net Earnings (Loss) Net earnings for 2010 were $473,000 ($0.03 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $22.1 million ($1.27 per share) in 2009 primarily due to the increase in gross profit and decrease in SG A expense, which was partially offset by the $1.5 million litigation settlement in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash Flow Analysis Operating activities of continuing operations used $2.9 million of cash during 2011 while providing $13.0 million in 2010 and $22.1 million in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The year-over-year change in 2011 was primarily due to the prior year receipt of a $13.3 million income tax refund associated with the carryback of net operating losses and the $2.5 million increase in the cash used by the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.6 million in 2011 from the prior year largely due to the assets acquired in the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	The current year loss includes a $3.8 million asset impairment charge related to restructuring activities and the prior year earnings include a $2.3 million charge for inventory write-downs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	Net working capital used $16.4 million of cash in the current year and $13.9 million in 2010.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S5	The cash used by working capital in 2011 was due to a $17.0 million increase in accounts receivable that resulted from the increased sales associated with the Ivy Acquisition and higher selling prices, and the $11.9 million increase in inventory due to higher raw material purchases and unit costs, which were partially offset by the $12.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses also related to the increases in raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S6	Net working capital used $13.9 million of cash in 2010 while providing $20.3 million in 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S7	The cash used by net working capital in 2010 was due to the $7.7 million increase in inventories (excluding the impact of the inventory write-downs) as a result of higher raw material costs, a $3.7 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher current year shipments together with a $2.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to changes in the mix of vendor payments.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S8	The cash provided by working capital in 2009 was due to the $28.3 million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from reductions in shipments and selling prices, and the $6.7 million decrease in inventories (excluding the impact of the inventory write-downs) resulting from our inventory reduction initiatives.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S9	These decreases were partially offset by the $14.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was primarily due to the payment of $10.9 million of accrued income taxes payable, and lower raw material purchases.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S10	We may elect to make additional adjustments in our operating activities should the current recessionary conditions in our construction end markets persist, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S11	While a downtown in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements Investing activities of continuing operations used $41.4 million of cash during 2011 compared to $1.9 million during 2010 and $2.2 million during 2009.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S12	The increase in cash used in the current year was primarily related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S13	Capital expenditures amounted to $7.9 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are expected to total less than $10 million for fiscal 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S14	Current year investing activities also include $2.4 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility and $1.1 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_11_ITEM7_P42_S15	Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $2.4 million of cash during 2010 due to the proceeds received from the sale of the real estate associated with our discontinued industrial wire business.
764401_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, which gives us the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Financing activities used $1.6 million of cash during 2011 compared to $2.5 million and $11.3 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
764401_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	During the current year, $2.1 million of cash dividends were paid compared to $2.1 million and $11.4 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
764401_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	Prior year financing activities also include $409,000 of financing costs that were incurred in connection with the amendment of our credit facility.
764401_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Credit Facility We have a $75.0 million revolving credit facility in place, which matures in June 2015 and supplements our operating cash flow in funding our working capital, capital expenditure and general corporate requirements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	As of October 1, 2011, $656,000 was outstanding on the revolving credit facility, $73.2 million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.1 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	During the year, ordinary course borrowings on our revolving credit facility were as high as $8.8 million.
764401_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	As of October 2, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding on the credit facility, $49.6 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $919,000.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	As part of the consideration for purchasing certain assets of Ivy on November 19, 2010 (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), we entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Note requires semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Note bears interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and is collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	Based on the terms of the Note, we expect to make cash payments of approximately $775,000 for interest and a principal payment of $675,000 during fiscal 2012.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, principal and interest payments on the Note and share repurchases, if any.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S5	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our revolving credit facility.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S6	However, further deterioration of market conditions in the construction sector could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers, which would likely reduce our operating cash flows.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S7	Under such circumstances, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S8	Should we determine, at any time, that we require additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that are potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S9	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_11_ITEM7_P46_S10	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Impact of Inflation We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	During 2009, selling prices for our products declined dramatically in response to softening demand and the inventory destocking measures pursued by our customers, which negatively impacted our financial results as we consumed higher cost inventory that was purchased prior to the collapse in steel prices.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	During 2010 and 2011, wire rod prices have risen due to the escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers and increased demand from non-construction applications.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	Our ability to fully recover higher wire rod prices during this period has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the ongoing weakness in our construction end-markets.
764401_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 1, 2011.
764401_11_ITEM9_P0_S1	This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer.
764401_11_ITEM9_P0_S2	Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
764401_11_ITEM9_P0_S3	Furthermore, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S3	Internal control over financial reporting includes: (1) maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of financial statements, and that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (3) providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S4	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of financial statements would be prevented or detected.
764401_11_ITEM9_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
764401_11_ITEM9_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
764401_11_ITEM9_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2011.
764401_11_ITEM9_P2_S2	During the quarter ended October 1, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
764401_11_ITEM9_P2_S3	Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011.
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Insteel Industries, Inc.:
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S1	We have audited Insteel Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (a North Carolina corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Insteel Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
764401_11_ITEM9_P3_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
764401_11_ITEM9_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
764401_11_ITEM9_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
764401_11_ITEM9_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
764401_11_ITEM9_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
764401_11_ITEM9_P5_S0	In our opinion, Insteel Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
764401_11_ITEM9_P5_S1	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Insteel Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2011, and our report dated November 10, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

764401_11_ITEM15_P3_S0	the risks and uncertainties discussed herein under the caption Risk Factors.
764401_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Insteel Industries, Inc. ( we, us, our, the Company or Insteel ) is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand ( PC strand ) and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement ( CPR ) and standard welded wire reinforcement ( SWWR ).
764401_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction.
764401_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	For fiscal 2012, we estimate that approximately 90% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 10% were related to residential construction.
764401_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate nine manufacturing facilities that are located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our growth initiatives are focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our exit from the industrial wire business in June 2006 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) was the last in a series of divestitures which served to narrow our strategic and operational focus to concrete reinforcing products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain of the assets of Ivy Steel and Wire, Inc.
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	( Ivy ) for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments (the Ivy Acquisition ).
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; the production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Additional information about us and our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available at no cost on our web site at http://investor.insteel.com/sec.cfm and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
764401_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not part of this report and shall not be deemed incorporated into any of our SEC filings.
764401_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of PC strand and WWR.
764401_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	PC strand is a high strength seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	For 2012, 2011 and 2010, PC strand sales represented 37%, 38% and 48%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a replacement for hot-rolled rebar due to the cost advantages that it offers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	For 2012, 2011 and 2010, WWR sales represented 63%, 62% and 52%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our sales force is organized by product line and trained in the technical applications of our products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our products are sold nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, and delivered primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and scheduling requirements.
764401_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors and rebar fabricators.
764401_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	In fiscal 2012, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors and rebar fabricators.
764401_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as a high percentage of our customers sell into both the nonresidential and residential construction sectors.
764401_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	There were no customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.
764401_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Backlog is minimal for our business because of the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders existing on September 29, 2012 will be shipped prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
764401_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications and actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, although we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, the highest level of shipments within the year typically occurs when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, the level of construction activity tends to be correlated with general economic conditions although there can be significant differences between the relative performance of the nonresidential versus residential construction sectors for extended periods.
764401_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our end products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pricing for wire rod tends to fluctuate based on both domestic and global market conditions.
764401_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 represented approximately 17% and 15%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that the substantial volume and desirable mix of grades represented by our wire rod requirements constitutes a competitive advantage by making us a more attractive customer to our suppliers relative to our competitors.
764401_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Domestic wire rod producers have invested heavily in recent years to improve their quality capabilities and augment their product mix by increasing the proportion of higher value-added products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	This evolution toward higher value-added products has generally benefited us in our sourcing of wire rod for PC strand as this grade is more metallurgically and technically sophisticated.
764401_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	At the same time, domestic producers have deemphasized the production of the less sophisticated, low carbon grades of wire rod due to the more intense competitive conditions that prevail in this market.
764401_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	As a result, we typically rely more heavily on imports for supplies of lower grade wire rod.
764401_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Historically, when traditional offshore suppliers have withdrawn from the domestic market following the filing of trade cases by the domestic industry, new suppliers have filled the resulting gaps in supply.
764401_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	These laws generally require a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	However, the timing of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The relative supply and demand conditions in our markets determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe that we are the largest domestic producer of PC strand and WWR.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Steel Wire Co. and Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	Market participants compete on the basis of price, quality and service.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S5	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc., Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S6	Our primary competitors for PC strand are American Spring Wire Corporation, Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Strand-Tech Martin, Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation .
764401_12_ITEM1_P28_S7	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market.
764401_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	In 2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Technology has become a critical factor in remaining competitive from the standpoint of conversion costs and quality.
764401_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	In view of our sophisticated information systems, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low cost production capabilities, strong market positions, and broad product offering and geographic reach, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	As of September 29, 2012, we employed 682 people.
764401_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
764401_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	However, should we experience a disruption of production, we have contingency plans in place that we believe would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.
764401_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business and geographic areas, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
764401_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our executive officers are as follows:
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	H. O. Woltz III, 56, was elected Chief Executive Officer in 1991 and has been employed by us and our subsidiaries in various capacities since 1978.
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	He was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1989.
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	He served as our Vice President from 1988 to 1989 and as President of Rappahannock Wire Company, formerly a subsidiary of our Company, from 1981 to 1989.
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Mr. Woltz has been a Director since 1986 and also serves as President of Insteel Wire Products Company.
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	Mr. Woltz served as President of Florida Wire and Cable, Inc. until its merger with Insteel Wire Products Company in 2002.
764401_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	Mr. Woltz serves on the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2009.
764401_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Michael C. Gazmarian, 53, was elected Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in February 2007.
764401_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	He had previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since 1994, the year he joined us.
764401_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Gazmarian had been employed by Guardian Industries Corp., a privately-held manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products, since 1986, serving in various financial capacities.
764401_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	James F. Petelle, 62, joined us in October 2006.
764401_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	He was elected Vice President and Assistant Secretary on November 14, 2006 and Vice President - Administration and Secretary on January 12, 2007.
764401_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	He was previously employed by Andrew Corporation, a publicly-held manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, having served as Secretary from 1990 to May 2006, and Vice President - Law from 2000 to October 2006.
764401_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Richard T. Wagner, 53, joined us in 1992 and has served as Vice President and General Manager of the Concrete Reinforcing Products Business Unit of the Company s subsidiary, Insteel Wire Products Company, since 1998.
764401_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Prior to 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products, since 1977.
764401_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 21, 2012 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 12, 2013.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The tightening in the credit markets that has persisted since fiscal 2009 could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of construction activity resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Further, the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2012.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In March 2010, Congress passed and the President signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	This legislation may have a significant impact on health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If the implementation of this legislation significantly increases the costs attributable to our self-insured health plans, it may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During fiscal 2012, our common stock traded as high as $13.74 and as low as $8.93.
764401_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Insteel s corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	At September 29, 2012, we operated nine manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate.
764401_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate for the current and projected needs for our existing products.
764401_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	On November 19, 2007, Dwyidag Systems International, Inc ( DSI ) filed a third-party lawsuit in the Ohio Court of Claims alleging that certain epoxy-coated strand sold by us to DSI in 2002, and supplied by DSI to the Ohio Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) for a bridge project, was defective.
764401_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The third-party action sought recovery of any damages which could have been assessed against DSI in the action filed against it by ODOT, which allegedly could have been in excess of $8.3 million, plus $2.7 million in damages allegedly incurred by DSI.
764401_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	In 2009, the Ohio court granted our motion for summary judgment as to the third-party claim against us on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, but DSI filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling.
764401_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	In addition, we previously filed a lawsuit against DSI in the North Carolina Superior Court in Surry County seeking recovery of $1.4 million (plus interest) owed for other products sold by us to DSI, which action was removed by DSI to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 7, 2010, we participated in a structured mediation with ODOT and DSI which led to settlement of all of the above legal matters.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The parties dismissed the action in the Middle District of North Carolina on December 23, 2010, and the Ohio Court of Claims action was dismissed on January 21, 2011.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Pursuant to the settlement agreement, which was approved by the Ohio Court of Claims on January 5, 2011, the parties released each other from all liability arising out of the sale of strand for the bridge project.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	In connection with the settlement, we reserved the remaining outstanding balance that we were owed by DSI and agreed to make a cash payment of $600,000 to ODOT.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	During fiscal 2011, we paid the $600,000 settlement to ODOT and wrote off the DSI receivables against the previously established reserve.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	The resolution of this matter has enabled us to restore our commercial relationship with DSI that had existed prior to the initiation of the legal proceedings.
764401_12_ITEM3_P1_S6	Our fiscal 2010 results reflect a $1.5 million charge relating to the net effect of the settlement.
764401_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are also, from time to time, involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 24, 2012, there were 825 shareholders of record.
764401_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividend per share declared in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011:
764401_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to dividend payments.
764401_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended September 29, 2012.
764401_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on September 29, 2007 in each of our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
764401_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	On November 18, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to buy back up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
764401_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
764401_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence or suspend the program at any time at our discretion without prior notice.
764401_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	The share repurchase authorization continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of September 29, 2012, there was $24.8 million remaining available for future share repurchases under this authorization.
764401_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	During 2011, we repurchased $143,000 or 12,633 shares of our common stock through restricted stock net-share settlements.
764401_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2012.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, effective April 25, 2009, amending the Rights Agreement dated as of April 27, 1999 between us and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, successor to First Union National Bank.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	No. 1 and the Rights Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Rights Agreement.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S2	In connection with adopting the Rights Agreement, on April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S3	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S4	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us on certain dates described in the Rights Agreement one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement.
764401_12_ITEM5_P6_S5	For more information regarding our Rights Agreement, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted and retrospectively applied new accounting guidance related to the calculation of earnings per share which resulted in the following reductions in basic and diluted earnings per share:
764401_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Following our exit from the industrial wire business (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
764401_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain of the assets of Ivy for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments.
764401_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; the production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such, are excluded from revenue.
764401_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers' financial position, cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized during the period incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.
764401_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur.
764401_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant.
764401_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The compensation cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant.
764401_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	This model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value.
764401_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for our defined employee benefit plans, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ) and the supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits.
764401_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.
764401_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	The discount rate for the Delaware Plan and SERPs was 4%, 4.75% and 5.25% for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
764401_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations.
764401_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year.
764401_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	The amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year.
764401_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	We regularly review our actual asset allocation and, when appropriate, rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation.
764401_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	For 2012, 2011 and 2010, the assumed long-term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the Delaware Plan was 8%.
764401_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long-term return on plan assets in 2013.
764401_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	In determining the appropriateness of this assumption, we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets, the current and projected asset mix, our investment objectives and information provided by our third-party investment advisors.
764401_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually.
764401_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss.
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains.
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Under GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees).
764401_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above.
764401_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the Delaware Plan are reasonable and appropriate.
764401_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The funding requirements for the Delaware Plan are based upon applicable regulations, and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under ASC Topic 715 for financial reporting purposes.
764401_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	During 2012 and 2011, we made contributions totaling $206,000 and $478,000, respectively, to the Delaware Plan.
764401_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	No contributions were required to be made to the Delaware Plan during 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension costs for 2013 to be $28,000 for the Delaware Plan and $916,000 for the SERPs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Cash contributions to the plans during 2013 are expected to be $362,000 for the Delaware Plan and $244,000 for the SERPs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the Delaware Plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 29, 2012 by approximately $101,000 and have no impact on the expected net periodic pension cost for 2013.
764401_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 29, 2012 by approximately $266,000 and $195,000, respectively, and the net periodic pension cost for 2013 by approximately $23,000.
764401_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for 2013 by approximately $4,000.
764401_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an update that amends the guidance provided in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income , by requiring that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	This update becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
764401_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net sales increased 7.8% to $363.3 million in 2012 from $336.9 million in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Shipments for the year increased 5.1% and average selling prices increased 2.6% from the prior year levels.
764401_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to the full year contribution of the Ivy facilities in 2012.
764401_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented to recover higher raw material costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Gross profit decreased 29.3% to $22.5 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2012 from $31.7 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the narrowing of spreads between selling prices and raw material costs resulting from competitive pricing pressures.
764401_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules.
764401_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) decreased 3.6% to $18.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in 2012 from $19.6 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2011 primarily due to the relative year-over-year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($975,000), an increase in the net gains on the settlement of life insurance policies ($148,000) and a reduction in consulting and professional services expense ($276,000).
764401_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $710,000 in the current year compared with a decrease of $265,000 in the prior year due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	These reductions in SG A expense were partially offset by higher employee benefit costs ($278,000) and bad debt expense ($142,000).
764401_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in employee benefit costs expense was primarily related to an increase in supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	A gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $425,000 was recorded in 2012 for the discount on our prepayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the subordinated note that was issued in connection with the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net restructuring charges decreased 90.0% to $832,000 in 2012 from $8.3 million in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to reduced restructuring activities associated with the Ivy Acquisition during 2012.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Net restructuring charges for 2012 included $744,000 for equipment relocation costs and $139,000 for facility closure costs less $11,000 of net proceeds from the sale of decommissioned equipment and a $40,000 adjustment related to the remaining employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Net restructuring charges of $8.3 million in the prior year included $3.8 million for impairment charges related to plant closures and the decommissioning of equipment, $2.3 million for employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions, $1.2 million for equipment relocation costs, $533,000 for the future lease obligations associated with the closed Houston, Texas facility and $464,000 for facility closure costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	The plant closure costs were incurred in connection with the consolidation of our Texas and Northeast operations, which involved the closure of facilities in Houston, Texas and Wilmington, Delaware, and the absorption of the business by other Insteel facilities.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	The plant closure costs are net of a $1.6 million gain on the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility.
764401_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	The employee separation costs were related to the staffing reductions that were implemented across our sales, administration and manufacturing support functions to address the redundancies resulting from the Ivy Acquisition and in connection with the plant closures.
764401_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Acquisition costs of $3.5 million were incurred in 2011 for the advisory, accounting, legal and other professional fees directly related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The accounting requirements for business combinations require the expensing of acquisition costs in the period in which they are incurred.
764401_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	We did not incur any additional acquisition costs related to the Ivy Acquisition in 2012.
764401_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	A bargain purchase gain of $500,000 was recorded in 2011 based on the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Ivy Acquisition over the purchase price.
764401_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Interest expense decreased 35.0% to $623,000 in 2012 from $958,000 in 2011 primarily due to the lower interest rate on borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the current year period relative to the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition that was outstanding in the prior year and prepaid in December 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 33.6% in 2012 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-taxable life insurance proceeds, which were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation expense.
764401_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The effective income tax rate in 2011 was distorted by the impact of changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses and tax credits that we do not expect to realize.
764401_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net earnings were $1.8 million ($0.10 per share) in 2012 compared with a net loss of $387,000 ($0.02 per share) in 2011 with the year-over-year change primarily due to reductions in the restructuring charges and acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Ivy Acquisition and the current year gain from the early extinguishment of debt partially offset by the decrease in gross profit.
764401_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net sales increased 59.2% to $336.9 million in 2011 from $211.6 million in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Shipments for 2011 increased 33.7% and average selling prices increased 17.7% from the prior year levels.
764401_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to the addition of the Ivy facilities in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented during 2011 to recover higher raw material costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Gross profit increased to $31.7 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2011 from $18.0 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the addition of the Ivy facilities in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Gross profit for 2011 benefited from higher spreads between selling prices and raw material costs partially offset by the sale of the higher cost inventory acquired from Ivy that was valued at fair value in accordance with purchase accounting requirements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	Gross profit for 2010 includes a $1.9 million charge for inventory write-downs to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market.
764401_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules.
764401_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	SG A expense increased 22.4% to $19.6 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2011 from $16.0 million, or 7.6% of net sales, in 2010 primarily due to staffing additions ($1.3 million) and other transition-related costs ($151,000) largely related to the Ivy Acquisition, the relative year-over-year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($595,000) and increases in stock-based compensation ($638,000), employee benefit costs ($312,000), travel expense ($239,000) and professional services costs ($167,000).
764401_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased $265,000 in 2011 compared with an increase of $330,000 in 2010 due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase in stock-based compensation expense was largely due to the full vesting of awards for plan participants that became retirement eligible in 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily related to higher employee medical expense during 2011.
764401_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	These increases in SG A expense were partially offset by a net gain on the settlement of life insurance policies ($357,000) and a reduction in legal expenses ($393,000) primarily due to the 2010 costs associated with the PC strand trade cases.
764401_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net restructuring charges of $8.3 million were recorded in 2011, including $3.8 million for impairment charges related to plant closures and the decommissioning of equipment, $2.3 million for employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions, $1.2 million for equipment relocation costs, $533,000 for the future lease obligations associated with the closed Houston, Texas facility and $464,000 for facility closure costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The plant closure costs were incurred in connection with the consolidation of our Texas and Northeast operations, which involved the closure of facilities in Houston, Texas and Wilmington, Delaware, and the absorption of the business by other Insteel facilities.
764401_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	The plant closure costs are net of a $1.6 million gain on the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility.

764401_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	A bargain purchase gain of $500,000 was recorded in 2011 based on the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Ivy Acquisition over the purchase price.
764401_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest expense increased 111.5% to $958,000 in 2011 from $453,000 in 2010 primarily due to the interest on the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition, which was partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized financing costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2011 was distorted by the impact of changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses and tax credits that we do not expect to realize.
764401_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our effective income tax rate was (9.0%) in 2010, which reflects the favorable impact of a $500,000 increase in a tax refund as the result of changes in the federal tax regulations regarding the carryback of net operating losses partially offset by $200,000 of net reserves recorded pertaining to known tax exposures in accordance with ASC 740 together with changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to lower non-deductible life insurance expense.
764401_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	A expense partially offset by the increase in gross profit and the bargain purchase gain.
764401_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Earnings from discontinued operations were $15,000 in 2010, which had no effect on earnings per share, and were primarily related to the gain on the sale of the real estate associated with the industrial wire business partially offset by facility-related costs incurred prior to the sale and income tax expense.
764401_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The net loss was $387,000 ($0.02 per share) in 2011 compared with net earnings of $473,000 ($0.03 per share) in 2010 with the year-over-year change primarily due to the restructuring charges and acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Ivy Acquisition and higher SG A expense partially offset by the increase in gross profit and the bargain purchase gain.
764401_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operating activities provided $13.1 million of cash in 2012 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Net working capital provided $0.9 million of cash as a $10.6 million decrease in inventories was partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Operating activities used $2.9 million of cash in 2011 due to an increase in net working capital, which was partially offset by non-cash items added back to the net loss.
764401_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net working capital used $16.4 million of cash due to a $17.0 million increase in accounts receivable and an $11.9 million increase in inventories partially offset by a $12.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to the incremental sales associated with the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	The changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to higher raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Operating activities provided $12.9 million of cash in 2010 primarily due to the receipt of a $13.3 million income tax refund associated with the carryback of net operating losses in the prior year and net earnings adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by an increase in net working capital.
764401_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Net working capital used $13.9 million of cash due to a $7.7 million increase in inventories, a $3.7 million increase in accounts receivable and a $2.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	The increases in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily due to higher raw material costs and selling prices.
764401_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due to changes in the mix of vendor payments and related terms.
764401_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense was $9.8 million in 2012, $9.6 million in 2011 and $7.0 million in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 and 2012 was primarily associated with the assets that were acquired in the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	We may elect to make additional adjustments in our operating activities should the current recessionary conditions in our construction end markets persist, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Investing activities used $8.2 million of cash in 2012 and $41.4 million in 2011 while providing $0.4 million in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Capital expenditures were $8.1 million in 2012, $7.9 million in 2011 and $1.5 million in 2010, and are expected to total less than $12.0 million in 2013.
764401_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Ivy acquisition used $37.3 million of cash in 2011, which was partially offset by $2.4 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility and $1.1 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $2.4 million of cash in 2010 from the proceeds on the sale of the real estate associated with our discontinued industrial wire business.
764401_12_ITEM7_P63_S4	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Financing activities used $5.0 million of cash in 2012, $1.6 million in 2011 and $2.5 million in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Cash dividend payments were $2.1 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
764401_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Net debt repayments used $2.3 million of cash in 2012 and financing costs incurred in connection with the amendment of our credit facility used $0.2 million.
764401_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	On February 6, 2012, we entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	As of September 29, 2012, $11.5 million was outstanding on the Credit Facility, $67.2 million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.3 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	During the year, ordinary course borrowings on the Credit Facility were as high as $20.3 million.
764401_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	As of October 1, 2011, $656,000 was outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	As part of the consideration for the Ivy Acquisition (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), we entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases, if any.
764401_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility.
764401_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, further deterioration of market conditions in the construction sector could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers, which would likely reduce our operating cash flows.
764401_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	Under such circumstances, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we require additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that are potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	During 2010 and 2011, wire rod prices rose due to the escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers and increased demand from non-construction applications.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	After initially rising in the first half of 2012, wire rod prices declined during the latter part of the year due to reductions in the cost of scrap for wire rod producers and weakening demand.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	Our ability to fully recover higher wire rod prices during this period has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_12_ITEM7_P70_S6	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at September 29, 2012 are as follows:
764401_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	As we look ahead to 2013, our visibility remains limited due to the heightened degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for a recovery in the economy and employment market, the availability of financing in the credit markets and the increased volatility in raw material costs.
764401_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	Conditions in our construction end-markets appear to have stabilized following the steep decline in demand that we have experienced in recent years.
764401_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	However, we have yet to see signs of a pronounced recovery taking hold in our markets and believe that construction activity is likely to continue trending at depressed levels pending a more substantive upturn in the economy.
764401_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	In response to the challenges facing us, we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	We expect the contributions from the Ivy Acquisition to increase during the year through the realization of additional operational synergies and the reconfiguration of our combined WWR operations, which was completed in 2012.
764401_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ).
764401_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition, we will continue to evaluate further potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time, depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, should wire rod costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2012 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a $25.7 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Based on our interest rate exposure and the outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility as of September 29, 2012, a 25 basis point change in interest rates would have an estimated $29,000 impact on our pre-tax earnings over a one-year period.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.

764401_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date.
764401_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Monte Carlo valuation model considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and are thus excluded from revenue.
764401_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company includes all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
764401_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired from Ivy, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $9.8 million in 2012, $9.6 million in 2011 and $7.0 million in 2010 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

764401_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	When the Company determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, it measures recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_12_ITEM8_P28_S3	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized during the period incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a $3.8 million impairment charge resulting from the consolidation of its northeast and Texas operations and overall integration of the purchased Ivy facilities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	There were no impairment losses in 2012 and 2010.
764401_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	The carrying amount of long-term debt outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility approximates its estimated fair value.
764401_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	The estimated fair value of long-term debt is primarily based upon quoted market prices as well as borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.

764401_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets to the extent the Company no longer believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an update that amends the guidance provided in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income , by requiring that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
764401_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	This update becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
764401_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	On November 19, 2010, the Company purchased certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Ivy for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $51.1 million, consisting of $37.6 million of cash and a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note payable to Ivy (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) (the Ivy Acquisition ).
764401_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Subsequent to the date of the Ivy Acquisition, the Company recorded $780,000 of post-closing adjustments which reduced the final adjusted purchase price to $50.3 million.
764401_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of welded wire reinforcement and wire products for concrete construction applications.
764401_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company believes the addition of Ivy s facilities has enhanced Insteel s competitiveness in its Northeast, Midwest and Florida markets, in addition to providing a platform to serve the West Coast markets more effectively.
764401_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	The assets purchased included Ivy s production facilities in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; the production equipment at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	In addition, the Company assumed certain of Ivy s accounts payable and employee benefit obligations.
764401_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Following is a summary of the Company s final allocation of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Ivy Acquisition:
764401_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Accounting standards require that when the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, resulting in a bargain purchase gain, the acquirer must reassess the reasonableness of the values assigned to all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred.
764401_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company performed such a reassessment and concluded that the values assigned for the Ivy Acquisition were reasonable.
764401_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Consequently, the Company recorded a $500,000 bargain purchase gain on the Ivy Acquisition in fiscal 2011.
764401_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Ivy Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations .
764401_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	Acquisition and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, but are recorded as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Following the Ivy Acquisition, net sales of the Ivy facilities for the year ended October 1, 2011 were approximately $83.4 million.
764401_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The actual amount of net sales specifically attributable to the Ivy Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to the integration actions that have been taken by the Company involving the transfer of business between the former Ivy facilities and the Company s existing facilities.
764401_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Company has determined that the presentation of Ivy s earnings for the year ended October 1, 2011 is impractical due to the integration of Ivy s operations into the Company following the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects the combined results of operations of the Company had the Ivy Acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2010.
764401_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the Ivy Acquisition, including adjusted depreciation expense based on the fair value of the assets acquired, interest expense related to the secured subordinated promissory note and an appropriate adjustment in the prior year for the acquisition-related costs.
764401_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	The pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings which may result from the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that may have been achieved had the Ivy Acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2010, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
764401_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	The pro forma combined results of operations for the prior year periods are as follows:
764401_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Subsequent to the Ivy Acquisition, the Company elected to consolidate certain of its welded wire reinforcement operations in order to reduce its operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to the Company s existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	The Houston plant closure was completed in December 2010 and the Wilmington plant closure was completed in May 2011.
764401_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during the current and prior year periods:
764401_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	During the year ended September 29, 2012, all of the remaining restructuring liabilities were satisfied and the final proceeds were received from the sale of previously impaired machinery and equipment, which have been included in asset impairment charges.
764401_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Asset impairment charges include the proceeds received from the scrapping of certain machinery and equipment that were previously impaired.
764401_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	Facility closure costs for the prior year include a $1.6 million gain from the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility, which had been closed in May 2011.
764401_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	As of October 1, 2011, the Company had recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $254,000 on its consolidated balance sheet, including $112,000 in accounts payable and $142,000 in accrued expenses.
764401_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	For the year ended October 1, 2011, the Company recorded $3.5 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the Ivy Acquisition for advisory, accounting, legal and other professional fees.
764401_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company did not incur any additional acquisition costs related to the Ivy Acquisition in fiscal 2012.
764401_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	As of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
764401_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	The financial assets held by the Company and the fair value hierarchy used to determine their fair values are as follows:
764401_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value the Company would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis other than the assets and liabilities acquired from Ivy (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) that were acquired at fair value in the prior year.
764401_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	As of September 29, 2012, the carrying amount of long-term debt outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility approximates its estimated fair value.
764401_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	The estimated fair value of long-term debt is primarily based upon quoted market prices as well as borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.
764401_12_ITEM8_P53_S4	As of October 1, 2011, the carrying amount of the $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note payable to Ivy approximated fair value based on comparable debt with similar terms, conditions and proximity to the issuance date, which would be considered a level 2 input.
764401_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company has a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement its operating cash flow and fund its working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	On February 6, 2012, the Company and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	As of September 29, 2012, $11.5 million of borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $67.2 million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.3 million.
764401_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	As of October 1, 2011, $656,000 was outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at the election of the Company, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.50% - 1.25% for index rate loans and 1.50% - 2.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_12_ITEM8_P56_S3	Based on the Company s excess availability as of September 29, 2012, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.50% for index rate loans and 1.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company s ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if the Company is unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $13.5 million.
764401_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict the Company s ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of the Company s stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with affiliates of the Company; or permit liens to encumber the Company s property and assets.
764401_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur with respect to the Company upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company; certain entries of judgment against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control of the Company.
764401_12_ITEM8_P57_S4	As of September 29, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the credit facility was $97,000 in 2012, $81,000 in 2011 and $363,000 in 2010.
764401_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.2 million and $4.1 million as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, respectively.
764401_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Company expects the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	the Company entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_12_ITEM8_P59_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2012.
764401_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	Effective February 21, 2012, the Company s 2005 Equity Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares available for future grants by 900,000 shares.
764401_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	As of September 29, 2012, there were 786,000 shares available for future grants under the plans.
764401_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	Options granted under these plans generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Compensation expense and excess tax deficiencies (benefits) associated with stock options are as follows:

764401_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy for the Delaware Plan is to ensure that its assets are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plan as such obligations come due.
764401_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	The primary investment objectives include providing a total return that will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, diversifying investments across and within asset classes, minimizing the impact of losses in single investments and adhering to investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.

764401_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	As noted above, the SERPs were revised in 2005 to add Participants and increase benefits to certain existing Participants.
764401_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	However, for certain Participants the Company still maintains the benefits of the respective SERPs that were in effect prior to the 2005 changes, which entitles them to fixed cash benefits upon retirement at age 65, payable annually for 15 years.

(the Company ) for the period ended September 29, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, Michael C. Gazmarian, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to my knowledge:
764401_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	(2) the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
764401_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Insteel Industries, Inc. ( we, us, our, the Company or Insteel ) is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand ( PC strand ) and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement ( CPR ) and standard welded wire reinforcement ( SWWR ).
764401_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction.
764401_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	For fiscal 2013, we estimate that approximately 90% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 10% were related to residential construction.
764401_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate nine manufacturing facilities that are located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our growth initiatives are focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain assets of Ivy Steel and Wire, Inc.
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	( Ivy ) for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments (the Ivy Acquisition ).
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S5	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM1_P5_S6	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Additional information about us and our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available at no cost on our web site at http://investor.insteel.com/sec.cfm and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
764401_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not part of this report and shall not be deemed incorporated into any of our SEC filings.
764401_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of PC strand and WWR.
764401_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	PC strand is a high strength seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	For 2013, 2012 and 2011, PC strand sales represented 37%, 37% and 38%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a replacement for hot-rolled rebar due to the cost advantages that it offers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	For 2013, 2012 and 2011, WWR sales represented 63%, 63% and 62%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
764401_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our outside sales representatives sell multiple product lines in their respective territories, thereby reducing duplication of personnel and travel expenses as compared to the product line sales strategy previously utilized by the Company.
764401_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our sales representatives are trained in the technical applications of our products.
764401_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We sell our products nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering our products primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	In fiscal 2013, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as a high percentage of our customers sell into both the nonresidential and residential construction sectors.
764401_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	There were no customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011.
764401_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Backlog is minimal for our business because of the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders existing on September 28, 2013 will be shipped prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
764401_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications and actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, although we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, the highest level of shipments within the year typically occurs when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, the level of construction activity tends to be correlated with general economic conditions although there can be significant differences between the relative performance of the nonresidential and residential construction sectors for extended periods.
764401_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our end products.
764401_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pricing for wire rod tends to fluctuate based on both domestic and global market conditions.
764401_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 represented approximately 25% and 17%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that the substantial volume of our wire rod requirements, our strong financial condition and our desirable mix of sizes and grades represents a competitive advantage by making us a more attractive customer to our suppliers relative to our competitors.
764401_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	These laws generally require a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	However, the timing of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The relative supply and demand conditions in our markets determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We believe that we are the largest domestic producer of PC strand and WWR.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Steel Wire Co., Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S4	Market participants compete on the basis of price, quality and service.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S5	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc., Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S6	Our primary competitors for PC strand are American Spring Wire Corporation, Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Strand-Tech Martin, Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation .
764401_13_ITEM1_P26_S7	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market.
764401_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	In 2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	In view of our sophisticated information systems, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low cost production capabilities, strong market positions, and broad product offering and geographic reach, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of September 28, 2013, we employed 687 people.
764401_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
764401_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	However, should we experience a disruption of production, we have contingency plans in place that we believe would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.
764401_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business and geographic areas, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years 2014 and 2015.
764401_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our executive officers are as follows:

764401_13_ITEM1_P33_S5	Mr. Woltz serves on the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2009.
764401_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Michael C. Gazmarian, 54, was elected Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in February 2007.
764401_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	He had previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since 1994, the year he joined us.
764401_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Gazmarian had been employed by Guardian Industries Corp., a privately-held manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products, since 1986, serving in various financial capacities.
764401_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	James F. Petelle, 63, joined us in October 2006.
764401_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	He was elected Vice President and Assistant Secretary on November 14, 2006 and Vice President - Administration and Secretary on January 12, 2007.
764401_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	He was previously employed by Andrew Corporation, a publicly-held manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, having served as Secretary from 1990 to May 2006, and Vice President - Law from 2000 to October 2006.
764401_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Richard T. Wagner, 54, joined us in 1992 and has served as Vice President and General Manager of the Concrete Reinforcing Products Business Unit of the Company s subsidiary, Insteel Wire Products Company, since 1998.
764401_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Prior to 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products, since 1977.
764401_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 12, 2013 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 12, 2014.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The tightening in the credit markets that has persisted since fiscal 2009 could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In particular, the recent U.S. government partial shutdown presents a significant risk.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, and declines in revenues, profitability, and cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, we may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions, or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	These conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of construction activity resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Further, the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2013.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In March 2010, Congress passed and the President signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and is expected to increase our employee health care costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	This legislation requires certain large employers to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and must limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Although this new requirement has been delayed generally from January 2014 to January 2015, any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health plans could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During fiscal 2013, our common stock traded as high as $19.37 and as low as $10.53.
764401_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Insteel s corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	At September 28, 2013, we operated nine manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate.
764401_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected needs for our existing products.
764401_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are, from time to time, involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 23, 2013, there were 738 shareholders of record.
764401_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividend per share declared in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012:
764401_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
764401_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended September 28, 2013.
764401_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on September 27, 2008 in each of our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
764401_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	On November 18, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to buy back up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
764401_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
764401_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence or suspend the program at any time at our discretion without prior notice.
764401_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	The share repurchase authorization continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_13_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of September 28, 2013, there was $24.8 million remaining available for future share repurchases under this authorization.
764401_13_ITEM5_P4_S4	We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2013 and 2012.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, effective April 25, 2009, amending the Rights Agreement dated as of April 27, 1999 between us and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, successor to First Union National Bank.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	No. 1 and the Rights Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Rights Agreement.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	In connection with adopting the Rights Agreement, on April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S3	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S4	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us on certain dates described in the Rights Agreement one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement.
764401_13_ITEM5_P5_S5	For more information regarding our Rights Agreement, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	On November 19, 2010, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased certain assets of Ivy for approximately $50.3 million, after giving effect to post-closing adjustments.
764401_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of WWR and wire products for concrete construction applications (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Among other assets, we acquired Ivy s production facilities located in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; production equipment located at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also entered into a short-term sublease with Ivy for the Texas facility.
764401_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate certain of our WWR operations in order to reduce our operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to our existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such, are excluded from revenue.
764401_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers' financial position, cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.
764401_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant.
764401_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The compensation cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions such as expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates to determine the stock options fair value.
764401_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	We account for our defined employee benefit plans, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ) and the supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits.
764401_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.
764401_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	The discount rate for the Delaware Plan and SERPs was 4.75%, 4% and 4.75% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
764401_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations.
764401_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year.
764401_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	The amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year.
764401_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	We regularly review our actual asset allocation and, when appropriate, rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation.
764401_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	For 2013, 2012 and 2011, the assumed long-term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the Delaware Plan was 8%.
764401_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	We currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long-term return on plan assets in 2014.
764401_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	In determining the appropriateness of this assumption, we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets, the current and projected asset mix, our investment objectives and information provided by our third-party investment advisors.
764401_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually.
764401_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss.
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains.
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	Under GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees).
764401_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above.
764401_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the Delaware Plan are reasonable and appropriate.
764401_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	The funding requirements for the Delaware Plan are based upon applicable regulations, and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under ASC Topic 715 for financial reporting purposes.
764401_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made contributions totaling $307,000, $206,000 and $478,000, respectively, to the Delaware Plan.
764401_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension costs for 2014 to be $12,000 for the Delaware Plan and $588,000 for the SERPs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Cash contributions to the plans during 2014 are expected to be $247,000 for the Delaware Plan and $290,000 for the SERPs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the Delaware Plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 28, 2013 by approximately $80,000 and have no impact on the expected net periodic pension cost for 2014.
764401_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 28, 2013 by approximately $224,000 and $172,000, respectively, and the net periodic pension cost for 2014 by approximately $19,000.
764401_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for 2014 by approximately $5,000.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 changes the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements for all periods reported and eliminates the option under the previous guidance that allowed for the presentation of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	The update allows two options for the presentation of comprehensive income: (1) a single statement of comprehensive income, which includes all components of net income and other comprehensive income; or (2) a statement of income followed immediately by a statement of comprehensive income, which includes summarized net income and all components of other comprehensive income.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	The amendments in this update are effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	We adopted ASU No. 2011-05 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and chose to present a single statement of comprehensive income for our interim reporting periods and separate statements of income and comprehensive income for our annual reporting periods.
764401_13_ITEM7_P35_S5	The adoption of ASU 2011-05 did not impact our consolidated financial statements except for the change in presentation.
764401_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
764401_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	ASU No. 2013-02 requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income either on the face of the income statement or as a separate disclosure in the notes.
764401_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	This update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
764401_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net sales for 2013 were relatively flat at $363.9 million compared with $363.3 million in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Shipments for the year increased 4.6% while average selling prices decreased 4.3% from the prior year levels.
764401_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to modest improvement in market conditions and demand for our products relative to the prior year.
764401_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	The decrease in average selling prices was driven by competitive pricing pressures.
764401_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Gross profit increased 74.7% to $39.2 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in 2013 from $22.5 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs relative to the prior year together with higher shipments.
764401_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules.
764401_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) increased 9.4% to $20.7 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2013 from $18.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in 2012 primarily due to higher compensation expense ($1.5 million), a reduction in the gain on the settlement of life insurance policies ($460,000) and the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($155,000).
764401_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in compensation expense was primarily driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in the current year.
764401_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $555,000 in the current year compared with $710,000 in the prior year due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	These increases in SG A expense were partially offset by lower bad debt expense ($551,000).
764401_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	A gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $425,000 was recorded in 2012 for the discount on our prepayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the subordinated note that was issued in connection with the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net restructuring charges of $832,000 were recorded in 2012 that included $744,000 for equipment relocation costs and $139,000 for facility closure costs less $11,000 of net proceeds from the sale of decommissioned equipment and a $40,000 adjustment related to the remaining employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions.
764401_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Other expense for 2013 was $333,000 compared to $188,000 of other income in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The other expense for the current year was primarily due to the net loss on the disposal of equipment.
764401_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Interest expense decreased 62.3% to $235,000 in 2013 from $623,000 in 2012 primarily due to the reduction in average debt outstanding during 2013 and the lower interest rate on borrowings on the revolving credit facility relative to the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition that was outstanding in the prior year prior to its prepayment in December 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 34.8% in 2013 compared with 33.6% in 2012 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net earnings were $11.7 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2013 compared to $1.8 million ($0.10 per share) in 2012 with the year-over-year change primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense.
764401_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net sales increased 7.8% to $363.3 million in 2012 from $336.9 million in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Shipments for 2012 increased 5.1% from 2011 and average selling prices increased 2.6%.
764401_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to the full year contribution of the Ivy facilities in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented to recover higher raw material costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gross profit decreased 29.3% to $22.5 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2012 from $31.7 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the narrowing of spreads between selling prices and raw material costs resulting from competitive pricing pressures.
764401_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules.
764401_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	SG A expense decreased 3.6% to $18.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in 2012 from $19.6 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2011 primarily due to the relative year-over-year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($975,000), an increase in the gain on the settlement of life insurance policies ($148,000) and a reduction in consulting and professional services expense ($276,000).
764401_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $710,000 in 2012 compared with a decrease of $265,000 in 2011 due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	These reductions in SG A expense were partially offset by higher employee benefit ($278,000) and bad debt expense ($142,000).
764401_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	The increase in employee benefit expense was primarily related to an increase in supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	A gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $425,000 was recorded in 2012 for the discount on our prepayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the subordinated note that was issued in connection with the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net restructuring charges decreased 90.0% to $832,000 in 2012 from $8.3 million in 2011 primarily due to reduced restructuring activities associated with the Ivy Acquisition during 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net restructuring charges for 2012 included $744,000 for equipment relocation costs and $139,000 for facility closure costs less $11,000 of net proceeds from the sale of decommissioned equipment and a $40,000 adjustment related to the remaining employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Net restructuring charges of $8.3 million in 2011 included $3.8 million for impairment charges related to plant closures and the decommissioning of equipment, $2.3 million for employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions, $1.2 million for equipment relocation costs, $533,000 for the future lease obligations associated with the closed Houston, Texas facility and $464,000 for facility closure costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	The plant closure costs were incurred in connection with the consolidation of our Texas and Northeast operations, which involved the closure of facilities in Houston, Texas and Wilmington, Delaware, and the absorption of the business by other Insteel facilities.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	The plant closure costs are net of a $1.6 million gain on the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility.
764401_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	The employee separation costs were related to the staffing reductions that were implemented across our sales, administration and manufacturing support functions to address the redundancies resulting from the Ivy Acquisition and in connection with the plant closures.
764401_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Acquisition costs of $3.5 million were incurred in 2011 for the advisory, accounting, legal and other professional fees directly related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The accounting requirements for business combinations require the expensing of acquisition costs in the period in which they are incurred.
764401_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	We did not incur any additional acquisition costs related to the Ivy Acquisition in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	A bargain purchase gain of $500,000 was recorded in 2011 based on the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Ivy Acquisition over the purchase price.
764401_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest expense decreased 35.0% to $623,000 in 2012 from $958,000 in 2011 primarily due to the lower interest rate on borrowings on the revolving credit facility in 2012 relative to the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition that was outstanding in the prior year and prepaid in December 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 33.6% in 2012 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-taxable life insurance proceeds, which were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation expense.
764401_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The effective income tax rate in 2011 was distorted by the impact of changes in permanent book versus tax differences largely related to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses and tax credits that we do not expect to realize.
764401_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net earnings were $1.8 million ($0.10 per share) in 2012 compared with a net loss of $387,000 ($0.02 per share) in 2011 with the year-over-year change primarily due to reductions in the restructuring charges and acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Ivy Acquisition and the gain from the early extinguishment of debt partially offset by the decrease in gross profit in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Operating activities provided $36.8 million of cash in 2013 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net working capital provided $9.7 million of cash due to a $7.0 million decrease in inventories, a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $1.0 million decrease in accounts receivable.
764401_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was largely related to changes in the mix of vendor payments and terms.
764401_13_ITEM7_P56_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by a reduction in days sales outstanding.
764401_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Operating activities provided $13.1 million of cash in 2012 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Net working capital provided $0.9 million of cash as a $10.6 million decrease in inventories was partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operating activities used $2.9 million of cash in 2011 due to an increase in net working capital, which was partially offset by non-cash items added back to the net loss.
764401_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Net working capital used $16.4 million of cash due to a $17.0 million increase in accounts receivable and an $11.9 million increase in inventories partially offset by a $12.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to the incremental sales associated with the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	The changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to higher raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	We may elect to make additional adjustments in our operating activities should the current recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets persist, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Investing activities used $6.3 million of cash in 2013, $8.2 million in 2012 and $41.4 million in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Capital expenditures were $5.0 million in 2013, $8.1 million in 2012 and $7.9 million in 2011, and are expected to total less than $12.0 million in 2014.
764401_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain assets from Tatano Wire and Steel, Inc. in April 2013, an intangible asset was acquired for $1.9 million.
764401_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	These uses of cash were partially offset by $0.6 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	In 2011, the Ivy acquisition used $37.3 million of cash, which was partially offset by $2.4 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility and $1.1 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Financing activities used $15.1 million of cash in 2013, $5.0 million in 2012 and $1.6 million in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Net repayments of debt amounted to $11.5 million in 2013 and $2.3 million in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	Cash dividend payments were $6.6 million in 2013 (a special cash dividend of $4.5 million and regular cash dividends totaling $2.1 million) and $2.1 million in 2012 and 2011.
764401_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	In 2013, these uses of cash were partially offset by $3.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	On February 6, 2012, we entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of September 28, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility, $72.8 million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.5 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	During 2013, ordinary course borrowings on the Credit Facility were as high as $13.6 million.
764401_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	As of September 29, 2012, $11.5 million was outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	As part of the consideration for the Ivy Acquisition (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), we entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from the early extinguishment of debt in the 2012 consolidated statements of operations.
764401_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility.
764401_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	However, further deterioration of market conditions in the construction sector could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers, which would likely reduce our operating cash flows.
764401_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	Under such circumstances, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we required additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	During 2011, wire rod prices rose due to the escalation in the cost of scrap and other raw materials for wire rod producers and increased demand from non-construction applications.
764401_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	After initially rising in the first half of 2012, wire rod prices declined during the latter part of the year due to reductions in the cost of scrap for wire rod producers and weakening demand.
764401_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	During 2013, wire rod prices fluctuated within a narrower range and inflation did not have a material impact on our sales or earnings.
764401_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	Our ability to fully recover increases in wire rod prices over this period has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at September 28, 2013 are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	As we look ahead to 2014, our visibility remains limited due to the heightened degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for a recovery in the economy and employment market, the availability of financing in the credit markets and the volatility in raw material costs.
764401_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Conditions in our construction end-markets appear to be improving following the steep decline in demand that we have experienced in recent years.
764401_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	We have yet to see, however, a pronounced recovery taking hold and expect growth in nonresidential construction, our primary demand driver, to remain modest pending a more substantive upturn in the economy.
764401_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	In response to the challenges facing us, we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	We expect the contributions from the Ivy Acquisition to increase during the year through the realization of additional operational synergies and the anticipated benefits from the reconfiguration of our combined WWR operations, which was completed in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ).
764401_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	In addition, we will continue to pursue further potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time, depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, should wire rod costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2013 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a $23.8 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we were debt-free as of September 28, 2013, future borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of September 28, 2013.
764401_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2013, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

764401_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.

764401_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	When the Company determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, it measures recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.

764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 changes the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements for all periods reported and eliminates the option under the previous guidance that allowed for the presentation of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity.
764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	The update allows two options for the presentation of comprehensive income: (1) a single statement of comprehensive income, which includes all components of net income and other comprehensive income; or (2) a statement of income followed immediately by a statement of comprehensive income, which includes summarized net income and all components of other comprehensive income.
764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S3	The amendments in this update are effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S4	The Company adopted ASU No. 2011-05 in the first quarter of 2013 and chose to present a single statement of comprehensive income for interim reporting periods and separate statements of income and comprehensive income for annual reporting periods.
764401_13_ITEM8_P36_S5	The adoption of ASU 2011-05 did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements except for the change in presentation.
764401_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
764401_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	ASU No. 2013-02 requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income either on the face of the income statement or as a separate disclosure in the notes.
764401_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014.
764401_13_ITEM8_P37_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	On November 19, 2010, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Ivy for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $51.1 million, consisting of $37.6 million of cash and a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note payable to Ivy (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) (the Ivy Acquisition ).
764401_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Subsequent to the date of the Ivy Acquisition, the Company recorded $780,000 of post-closing adjustments which reduced the final adjusted purchase price to $50.3 million.
764401_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Ivy was one of the nation s largest producers of welded wire reinforcement and wire products for concrete construction applications.
764401_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company believes the addition of Ivy s facilities has enhanced Insteel s competitiveness in its Northeast, Midwest and Florida markets, in addition to providing a platform to serve the West Coast markets more effectively.
764401_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	The assets purchased included Ivy s production facilities in Arizona, Florida, Missouri and Pennsylvania; production equipment at a leased facility in Texas; and certain related inventories.
764401_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	In addition, the Company assumed certain of Ivy s accounts payable and employee benefit obligations.
764401_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Following is a summary of the Company s final allocation of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Ivy Acquisition:
764401_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Accounting standards require that when the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, resulting in a bargain purchase gain, the acquirer must reassess the reasonableness of the values assigned to all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred.
764401_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company performed such a reassessment and concluded that the values assigned for the Ivy Acquisition were reasonable.
764401_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Consequently, the Company recorded a $500,000 bargain purchase gain on the Ivy Acquisition in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Ivy Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations .
764401_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Acquisition and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, but are recorded as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Following the Ivy Acquisition, net sales of the Ivy facilities in 2011 were approximately $83.4 million.
764401_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The actual amount of net sales specifically attributable to the Ivy Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to the integration actions that were taken by the Company involving the transfer of business between the former Ivy facilities and the Company s existing facilities.
764401_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	The Company has determined that the presentation of Ivy s earnings for 2011 is impractical due to the integration of Ivy s operations into the Company following the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects the combined results of operations of the Company had the Ivy Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2010.
764401_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the Ivy Acquisition, including adjusted depreciation expense based on the fair value of the assets acquired, interest expense related to the secured subordinated promissory note and an appropriate adjustment for the acquisition-related costs in the prior year.
764401_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	The pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that may have been achieved had the Ivy Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2010, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
764401_13_ITEM8_P44_S4	The pro forma combined results of operations for 2011 are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Subsequent to the Ivy Acquisition, the Company elected to consolidate certain of its welded wire reinforcement operations in order to reduce its operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to the Company s existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Houston plant closure was completed in December 2010 and the Wilmington plant closure was completed in May 2011.
764401_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2012 and 2011:
764401_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	During 2012, all of the remaining restructuring liabilities were satisfied and the final proceeds were received from the sale of previously impaired machinery and equipment, which have been included in asset impairment charges.
764401_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Asset impairment charges include the proceeds received from the disposal of certain machinery and equipment that were previously impaired.
764401_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Facility closure costs in 2011 include a $1.6 million gain from the sale of the Wilmington, Delaware facility, which had been closed in May 2011.
764401_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded $3.5 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the Ivy Acquisition for advisory, accounting, legal and other professional fees.
764401_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The Company did not incur any additional acquisition costs related to the Ivy Acquisition in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	As of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, the Company held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
764401_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	The financial assets held by the Company and the fair value hierarchy used to determine their fair values are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	The carrying amount of the Company s cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value the Company would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, the Company had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
764401_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	As of September 29, 2012, the carrying amount of long-term debt outstanding under the Company s revolving credit facility approximated its estimated fair value.
764401_13_ITEM8_P56_S3	The estimated fair value of long-term debt is primarily based upon quoted market prices as well as borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.
764401_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company has a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement its operating cash flow and fund its working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	On February 6, 2012, the Company and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	As of September 28, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $72.8 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.5 million.
764401_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	As of September 29, 2012, $11.5 million of borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at the election of the Company, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.50% - 1.25% for index rate loans and 1.50% - 2.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_13_ITEM8_P59_S3	Based on the Company s excess availability as of September 28, 2013, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.50% for index rate loans and 1.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company s ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if the Company is unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	The Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $13.5 million.
764401_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict the Company s ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of the Company s stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with affiliates of the Company; or permit liens to encumber the Company s property and assets.
764401_13_ITEM8_P60_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur with respect to the Company upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company; certain entries of judgment against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control of the Company.
764401_13_ITEM8_P60_S4	As of September 28, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the credit facility was $102,000 in 2013, $97,000 in 2012 and $81,000 in 2011.
764401_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.3 million and $4.2 million as of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively.
764401_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company expects the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	the Company entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from the early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations in 2012.
764401_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Effective February 21, 2012, the Company s 2005 Equity Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares available for future grants by 900,000 shares.

764401_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options at September 28, 2013 was $622,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.28 years.
764401_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
764401_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $7.06, $5.20 and $5.31 per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
764401_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience.
764401_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
764401_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The dividend yield was calculated based on the Company s annual dividend as of the option grant date.
764401_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on the Company s stock.
764401_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term.
764401_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity:
764401_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	The 2013 stock option exercises included net exercises, pursuant to which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
764401_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	On January 21, 2009, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a change in the equity compensation program such that awards of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to employees and directors would be made in lieu of awards of restricted stock.
764401_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	RSUs granted under these plans are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense.
764401_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	The vesting period for RSUs is generally one to three years from the date of the grant.
764401_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	RSUs do not have voting rights.
764401_13_ITEM8_P71_S4	RSU grants and compensation expense are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs on September 28, 2013 was $985,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.53 years.

764401_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) requires that the Company periodically assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets to the extent the Company no longer believes it is more likely than not that they will be fully utilized.
764401_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	As of September 28, 2013, the Company had recorded a valuation allowance of $730,000 pertaining to various state NOLs and tax credits that were not expected to be utilized.
764401_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	The valuation allowance established by the Company is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on changes in facts and circumstances and would be reduced should the Company utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards against which an allowance had previously been provided or determine that such utilization is more likely than not.
764401_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	The $51,000 increase in the valuation allowance during 2013 is primarily due to the increase of certain state NOLs that are not expected to be utilized.
764401_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	As of September 28, 2013, the Company has no material, known tax exposures that require the establishment of contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions.

764401_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Delaware Plan provides benefits for eligible employees based primarily upon years of service and compensation levels.
764401_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company s funding policy is to contribute amounts at least equal to those required by law .
764401_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	The Delaware Plan was frozen effective September 30, 2008 whereby participants will no longer earn additional benefits.

764401_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the Delaware Plan are as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of the Company s fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	In establishing the discount rate, the Company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the plan.
764401_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption, the Company considers the historical returns and the future expectations of returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the Delaware Plan portfolio.
764401_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy for the Delaware Plan is to ensure that its assets are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plan as such obligations come due.
764401_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	The primary investment objectives include providing a total return that will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, diversifying investments across and within asset classes, minimizing the impact of losses in single investments and adhering to investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.

764401_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	The asset allocation for the Delaware Plan is as follows:
764401_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	As of September 28, 2013, the Delaware Plan s assets include equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents, and were required to be measured at fair value.
764401_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company uses a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, defined as follows: Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, thereby requiring the development of valuation assumptions.
764401_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	The fair values of the Delaware Plan s assets as of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 are as follows:

764401_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013, based on criteria established in the 1992 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
764401_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 28, 2013, and our report dated October 29, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

764401_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Insteel Industries, Inc. ( we, us, our, the Company or Insteel ) is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We manufacture and market PC strand and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement ( CPR ) and standard welded wire reinforcement ( SWWR ).
764401_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction.
764401_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	For fiscal 2014, we estimate that approximately 85% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 15% were related to residential construction.
764401_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate eleven manufacturing facilities that are located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our growth initiatives are focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation ( ASW ) for an adjusted purchase price of $33.9 million, subject to certain additional post-closing adjustments (the ASW Acquisition ).
764401_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, production equipment at its facility in Houston, Texas and its production equipment and facility in Newnan, Georgia.
764401_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	We also entered into an agreement with ASW pursuant to which we lease the Houston facility with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Additional information about us and our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available at no cost on our web site at http://investor.insteel.com/sec.cfm and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
764401_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not part of this report and shall not be deemed incorporated into any of our SEC filings.
764401_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of PC strand and WWR.
764401_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	PC strand is a high strength seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	For 2014, 2013 and 2012, PC strand sales represented 38%, 37% and 37%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a replacement for hot-rolled rebar due to the cost advantages that it offers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	For 2014, 2013 and 2012, WWR sales represented 62%, 63% and 63%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our outside sales representatives sell multiple product lines in their respective territories, thereby reducing duplication of personnel and travel expenses as compared to the product line sales strategy previously utilized by the Company.
764401_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our sales representatives are trained in the technical applications of our products.
764401_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We sell our products nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering our products primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	In fiscal 2014, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as a high percentage of our customers sell into both the nonresidential and residential construction sectors.
764401_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	There were no customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012.
764401_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Backlog is minimal for our business because of the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders existing on September 27, 2014 will be shipped prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
764401_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications and actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, although we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, the highest level of shipments within the year typically occurs when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, the level of construction activity tends to be correlated with general economic conditions although there can be significant differences between the relative performance of the nonresidential and residential construction sectors for extended periods.
764401_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our end products.
764401_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pricing for wire rod tends to fluctuate based on both domestic and global market conditions.
764401_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 represented approximately 30% and 25%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that the substantial volume of our wire rod requirements, our strong financial condition and our desirable mix of sizes and grades represents a competitive advantage by making us a more attractive customer to our suppliers relative to our competitors.
764401_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	These laws generally require a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The relative supply and demand conditions in our markets determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	We believe that we are the largest domestic producer of PC strand and WWR.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Steel Wire Co., Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Market participants compete on the basis of price, quality and service.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S5	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc., Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S6	Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Strand-Tech Martin, Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation .
764401_14_ITEM1_P26_S7	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market.
764401_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	In 2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and geographic reach, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low cost production capabilities and sophisticated information systems, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of September 27, 2014, we employed 847 people.
764401_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Company has no contracts with labor unions and has not experienced any work stoppages.
764401_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
764401_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Should we experience a disruption of production, we believe that the contingency plans we have in place would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.
764401_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business and geographic areas, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years 2015 and 2016.
764401_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our executive officers are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	H. O. Woltz III, 58, was elected Chief Executive Officer in 1991 and has been employed by us and our subsidiaries in various capacities since 1978.
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	He was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1989.
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	He served as our Vice President from 1988 to 1989 and as President of Rappahannock Wire Company, formerly a subsidiary of our Company, from 1981 to 1989.
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Mr. Woltz has been a Director since 1986 and also serves as President of Insteel Wire Products Company.
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	Mr. Woltz served as President of Florida Wire and Cable, Inc. until its merger with Insteel Wire Products Company in 2002.
764401_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	Mr. Woltz serves on the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2009.
764401_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Michael C. Gazmarian, 55, was elected Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in February 2007.
764401_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	He had previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since 1994, the year he joined us.
764401_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Gazmarian had been employed by Guardian Industries Corp., a privately-held manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products, since 1986, serving in various financial capacities.
764401_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	James F. Petelle, 64, joined us in October 2006.
764401_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	He was elected Vice President and Assistant Secretary on November 14, 2006 and Vice President - Administration and Secretary on January 12, 2007.
764401_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	He was previously employed by Andrew Corporation, a publicly-held manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, having served as Secretary from 1990 to May 2006, and Vice President - Law from 2000 to October 2006.
764401_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Richard T. Wagner, 55, joined us in 1992 and has served as Vice President and General Manager of the Concrete Reinforcing Products Business Unit of the Company s subsidiary, Insteel Wire Products Company, since 1998.
764401_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Prior to 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products, since 1977.
764401_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 12, 2014 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 17, 2015.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Tightening in the credit markets could unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather conditions on construction activity and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our customers may be adversely affected by negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Furthermore, a reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through most of fiscal 2014.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our earnings and cash flow from operations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand in most market environments.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to u nexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses .
764401_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and is expected to increase our employee health care costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	This legislation requires certain large employers to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and must limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Provisions of this law have become and will become effective at various dates over the next several years and many of the regulations and guidance for the law have not been implemented.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Due to the breadth and complexity of this law, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the requirement, we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our results.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health plans could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We may experience difficulties in integrating the ASW Acquisition and realizing the anticipated synergies, which could have a negative impact on our financial results .
764401_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There could be delays, disruptions or other unexpected challenges that arise in connection with the integration of the ASW Acquisition and realization of the anticipated synergies.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If we were unable to effectively resolve these delays, disruptions or other challenges, we could fail to effectively integrate the ASW Acquisition and realize the anticipated synergies, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets primarily related to the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions as part of our business strategy.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization and lower than projected operating results and cash flows.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If our review determined that goodwill is impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	During fiscal 2014, our common stock traded as high as $24.26 and as low as $15.45.
764401_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Insteel s corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	At September 27, 2014, we operated eleven manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Newnan, Georgia; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate except for the facility located in Houston, Texas which we currently lease from ASW with an option to purchase in the future.
764401_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected needs for our existing products.
764401_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are, from time to time, involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 20, 2014, there were 689 shareholders of record.

764401_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
764401_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended September 27, 2014.
764401_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on October 3, 2009 in each of our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
764401_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	On November 18, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to buy back up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
764401_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
764401_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence or suspend the program at any time at our discretion without prior notice.
764401_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	The share repurchase authorization continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_14_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of September 27, 2014, there was $24.8 million remaining available for future share repurchases under this authorization.
764401_14_ITEM5_P4_S4	We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2014 and 2013.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, effective April 25, 2009, amending the Rights Agreement dated as of April 27, 1999 between us and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, successor to First Union National Bank.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	No. 1 and the Rights Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Rights Agreement.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	In connection with adopting the Rights Agreement, on April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S3	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S4	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us on certain dates described in the Rights Agreement one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement.
764401_14_ITEM5_P5_S5	For more information regarding our Rights Agreement, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for an adjusted purchase price of $33.9 million, subject to certain additional post-closing adjustments.
764401_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, the production equipment at its facility in Houston, Texas and its production equipment and facility in Newnan, Georgia.
764401_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we lease the Houston facility from ASW with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such, are excluded from revenue.
764401_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position, cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling cost when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our balance sheet.
764401_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	We will perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	We will monitor operating results within the reporting unit throughout the upcoming year to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant any interim impairment testing.
764401_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Otherwise, the reporting unit will be subject to the required annual impairment test during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
764401_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including the expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could reduce the estimated fair value of our reporting unit in the future and result in an impairment of goodwill.
764401_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	From time to time, we may be involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings.
764401_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
764401_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant.
764401_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	The compensation cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions such as expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates to determine the stock options fair value.
764401_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Assumptions for employee benefit plans .
764401_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	We account for our defined employee benefit plans, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ) and the supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.
764401_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.
764401_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	The discount rate for the Delaware Plan and SERPs was 4.25%, 4.75% and 4.00% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
764401_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations.
764401_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year.
764401_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	The amount of net periodic pension cost or benefit that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year.
764401_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	We regularly review our actual asset allocation and, when appropriate, rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation.
764401_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	For 2014, 2013 and 2012, the assumed long-term rate of return utilized for the Delaware Plan assets was 8%.
764401_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long-term return on plan assets in 2015.
764401_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	In determining the appropriateness of this assumption, we considered the historical rate of return on the plan assets, the current and projected asset mix, our investment objectives and information provided by our third-party investment advisors.
764401_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually.
764401_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss.
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains.
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	Under GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees).
764401_14_ITEM7_P31_S5	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above.
764401_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the Delaware Plan are reasonable and appropriate.
764401_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The funding requirements for the Delaware Plan are based upon applicable regulations, and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under ASC Topic 715 for financial reporting purposes.
764401_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made contributions totaling $240,000, $307,000 and $206,000, respectively, to the Delaware Plan.
764401_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension (benefit) cost for 2015 to be ($8,000) for the Delaware Plan and $644,000 for the SERPs.
764401_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Cash contributions to the plans during 2015 are expected to be $261,000 for the Delaware Plan and $290,000 for the SERPs.
764401_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the Delaware Plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 27, 2014 by approximately $85,000 and have no impact on our expected net periodic pension benefit for 2015.
764401_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 27, 2014 by approximately $241,000 and $190,000, respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for 2015 by approximately $21,000.
764401_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan would have reduced our expected net periodic pension benefit for 2015 by approximately $6,000.
764401_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
764401_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	ASU No. 2013-02 requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income either on the face of the income statement or as a separate disclosure in the notes.
764401_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	We adopted ASU No. 2013-02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
764401_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
764401_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	We are evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net sales increased 12.4% to $409.0 million in 2014 from $363.9 million in 2013.
764401_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Shipments for the year increased 12.8% while average selling prices decreased 0.3% from the prior year levels.
764401_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions and increased demand for our products relative to the prior year as well as the addition of the ASW facilities for a portion of our fourth quarter.
764401_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Sales for both years reflect depressed volumes on an absolute basis relative to the prerecession levels in our construction end-markets.
764401_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross profit increased 24.3% to $48.8 million, or 11.9% of net sales, in 2014 from $39.2 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in 2013.
764401_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($6.8 million) and higher shipments ($5.4 million), partially offset by higher unit conversion costs ($1.2 million).
764401_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($8.5 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($1.4 million) and higher freight expense ($0.3 million).
764401_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely driven by reduced operating schedules.
764401_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) increased 13.0% to $23.4 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2014 from $20.7 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2013 primarily due to increases in compensation ($1.7 million), employee benefits ($0.3 million), amortization of intangible assets ($0.3 million) and bad debt expense ($0.2 million).
764401_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in compensation expense was primarily driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in the current year.
764401_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily due to higher employee health insurance costs during 2014.
764401_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	The higher amortization expense is related to the additional intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	The increase in bad debt expense was due to an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts driven by the increase in sales and accounts receivable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net restructuring charges of $1.2 million were incurred in 2014 for employee separation costs associated with staffing reductions that were implemented in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Acquisition costs of $0.6 million were incurred in 2014 for legal, accounting and other professional fees related to the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The accounting requirements for business combinations require the expensing of acquisition costs in the period in which they are incurred.
764401_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other income for 2014 was $1.9 million compared to $0.3 million of other expense in 2013.
764401_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The other income for the current year was primarily due to the net gain from insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment damaged in the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility.
764401_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Other expense for 2013 was primarily due to a net loss on the disposal of equipment.
764401_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense increased 7.2% to $252,000 in 2014 from $235,000 in 2013 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding during 2014.
764401_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% in 2014 compared with 34.8% in 2013 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Net earnings increased to $16.6 million ($0.89 per diluted share) in 2014 from $11.7 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2013 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense together with the acquisition costs and restructuring charges associated with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net sales for 2013 were relatively flat at $363.9 million compared with $363.3 million in 2012.

764401_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to modest improvement in market conditions and demand for our products relative to 2012.
764401_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	The decrease in average selling prices was driven by competitive pricing pressures.
764401_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	Sales for both years reflect severely depressed volumes due to the continuation of recessionary conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Gross profit increased 74.7% to $39.2 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in 2013 from $22.5 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($15.0 million), higher shipments ($1.5 million) and lower unit conversion costs ($0.8 million).
764401_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($31.1 million) and freight expense ($0.2 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($16.3 million).
764401_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by depressed shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs largely due to reduced operating schedules.
764401_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	SG A expense increased 9.4% to $20.7 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2013 from $18.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in 2012 primarily due to higher compensation expense ($1.5 million), a reduction in the gain on the settlement of life insurance policies ($460,000) and the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($155,000).
764401_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in compensation expense was primarily driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in 2013.
764401_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $555,000 in 2013 compared with $710,000 in 2012 due to the related changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	These increases in SG A expense were partially offset by lower bad debt expense ($551,000).
764401_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	A gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $425,000 was recorded in 2012 for the discount on our prepayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the subordinated note that was issued in connection with the acquisition of Ivy Steel and Wire, Inc.
764401_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	( Ivy ) in 2011 ( Ivy Acquisition ).
764401_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net restructuring charges of $832,000 were recorded in 2012, which included $744,000 for equipment relocation costs and $139,000 for facility closure costs less $11,000 of net proceeds from the sale of decommissioned equipment and a $40,000 adjustment related to the remaining employee separation costs associated with plant closures and other staffing reductions.
764401_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Other expense for 2013 was $333,000 compared to $188,000 of other income in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The other expense for 2013 was primarily due to the net loss on the disposal of equipment.
764401_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Interest expense decreased 62.3% to $235,000 in 2013 from $623,000 in 2012 primarily due to the reduction in average debt outstanding during 2013 and the lower interest rate on borrowings on the revolving credit facility relative to the secured subordinated promissory note associated with the Ivy Acquisition that was outstanding in 2012 prior to its prepayment in December 2011.
764401_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 34.8% in 2013 compared with 33.6% in 2012 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net earnings increased to $11.7 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2013 from $1.8 million ($0.10 per share) in 2012 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense.
764401_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operating activities provided $29.2 million of cash in 2014 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Net working capital provided $2.4 million of cash due to a $21.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $16.8 million increase in inventories and a $2.1 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventories were largely related to higher raw material purchases driven by the increase in sales.
764401_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in sales.
764401_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Operating activities provided $36.8 million of cash in 2013 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in net working capital.

764401_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was largely related to changes in the mix of vendor payments and terms.
764401_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by a reduction in days sales outstanding.
764401_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Operating activities provided $13.1 million of cash in 2012 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in net working capital.
764401_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Net working capital provided $0.9 million of cash as a $10.6 million decrease in inventories was partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	We may elect to adjust our operating activities depending upon the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Investing activities used $40.4 million of cash in 2014, $6.3 million in 2013 and $8.2 million in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	In 2014, $33.9 million of cash was used to fund the ASW Acquisition and $9.0 million for capital expenditures (including $4.5 million to replace property and equipment damaged in the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility), which was partially offset by $2.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the Gallatin fire.
764401_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	In 2013, $5.0 million of cash was used for capital expenditures and $1.9 million for an intangible asset in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from Tatano Wire and Steel, Inc., which was partially offset by $0.6 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	In 2012, $8.1 million of cash was used for capital expenditures.
764401_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Financing activities used $1.2 million of cash in 2014, $15.1 million in 2013 and $5.0 million in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	In 2014, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	In 2013, $11.5 million of cash was used to repay debt and $6.6 million for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $4.5 million and regular cash dividends totaling $2.1 million), which was partially offset by $3.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	In 2012, $2.3 million of cash was used to repay debt and $2.1 million for dividends.
764401_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	On February 6, 2012, we entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	As of September 27, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility, $89.7 million of additional borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.5 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	During 2014, ordinary course borrowings on the Credit Facility were as high as $13.6 million.
764401_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	As of September 28, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	As part of the consideration for the Ivy Acquisition, we entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from the early extinguishment of debt in the 2012 consolidated statement of operations.
764401_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility.
764401_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we required additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	After initially rising in the first half of 2012, wire rod prices declined during the latter part of the year due to reductions in the cost of scrap for wire rod producers and weakening demand.
764401_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	During 2014 and 2013, wire rod prices fluctuated within a narrower range and inflation did not have a material impact on our sales or earnings.
764401_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Our ability to fully recover increases in wire rod prices over this period has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the reduced level of activity in our construction end-markets.
764401_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at September 27, 2014 are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	As we look ahead to 2015, we expect continued improvement in the conditions in our construction end-markets following the steep decline in demand that we have experienced in recent years.
764401_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	There are growing indications the recovery in private nonresidential construction, our primary demand driver, is strengthening, which should favorably impact our financial results through higher shipment volumes and operating levels at our facilities.
764401_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	The outlook for infrastructure construction is less clear pending the enactment of a new multi-year federal transportation funding authorization.
764401_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	We expect that our financial results will be favorably impacted by the full-year contribution of the ASW Acquisition together with the realization of additional operating synergies and benefits from the reconfiguration of our welded wire reinforcement operations related to the Ivy Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ).
764401_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition, we will continue to pursue further acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time, depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, should wire rod costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2014 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a $26.2 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we were debt-free as of September 27, 2014, future borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of September 27, 2014.
764401_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2014, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

764401_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and are thus excluded from revenue.
764401_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company includes all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
764401_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The valuation of inventory includes the costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
764401_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired through acquisitions, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $9.8 million in 2014, $9.7 million in 2013 and $9.8 million in 2012 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	No interest costs were capitalized in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company performs its annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	The Company will perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S5	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S6	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of the Company s annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on the Company s estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_14_ITEM8_P27_S7	In developing these assumptions, the Company considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity.
764401_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods.
764401_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	There was no impairment of goodwill in 2014.
764401_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Other assets consist principally of capitalized financing costs and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.
764401_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how and non-competition agreements that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their finite useful lives (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S3	The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S4	When the Company determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, it measures recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S5	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_14_ITEM8_P30_S6	There were no impairment losses in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
764401_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Fair value of financial instruments .
764401_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income.
764401_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets to the extent the Company no longer believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2013-02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
764401_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	ASU No. 2013-02 requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income either on the face of the income statement or as a separate disclosure in the notes.
764401_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company adopted ASU No. 2013-02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
764401_14_ITEM8_P35_S3	The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ).
764401_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	The Company is evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
764401_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	On August 15, 2014, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for an adjusted purchase price of $33.9 million, subject to certain additional post-closing adjustments (the ASW Acquisition ).
764401_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia.
764401_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, the production equipment at its facility in Houston, Texas and its production equipment and facility in Newnan, Georgia.
764401_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	Pursuant to an agreement with ASW, the Company will lease the Houston facility from ASW with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	In addition, the Company assumed certain of ASW s accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to its PC strand business.
764401_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Following is a summary of the Company s preliminary allocation of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the ASW Acquisition:
764401_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	In connection with the ASW Acquisition the Company acquired intangible assets consisting of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how and a non-competition agreement.
764401_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The ASW Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations .
764401_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Acquisition and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, but are recorded as expenses in the period in which such costs are incurred (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Following the ASW Acquisition, net sales of the ASW facilities in 2014 were approximately $7.3 million.
764401_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	The actual amount of net sales specifically attributable to the ASW Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to the integration actions that were taken by the Company involving the transfer of business between the former ASW facilities and the Company s existing facilities.
764401_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Company has determined that the presentation of ASW s earnings for 2014 is impractical due to the integration of ASW s operations into the Company following the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects the combined results of operations of the Company had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013.
764401_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the ASW Acquisition, including adjusted amortization and depreciation expense based on the fair value of the assets acquired, interest expense related to the borrowings on the Company s revolving credit facility and an appropriate adjustment for the acquisition-related costs in the current year.
764401_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	The pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the ASW Acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that may have been achieved had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
764401_14_ITEM8_P42_S4	The pro forma combined results of operations for the current and comparative prior year periods are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Subsequent to the ASW Acquisition, the Company incurred $1.2 million in employee separation costs for staffing reductions related to the acquisition.
764401_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Current and long-term restructuring liabilities were $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as of September 27, 2014.
764401_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	On November 19, 2010, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Ivy Steel and Wire, Inc.
764401_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Subsequent to the acquisition of Ivy, the Company elected to consolidate certain of its welded wire reinforcement operations in order to reduce its operating costs, which involved the closure of facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Houston, Texas.
764401_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	These actions were taken in response to the close proximity of Ivy s facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas to the Company s existing facilities in Wilmington, Delaware and Dayton, Texas.
764401_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Houston plant closure was completed in December 2010 and the Wilmington plant closure was completed in May 2011.
764401_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2012:
764401_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	During 2012, all of the remaining restructuring liabilities were satisfied and the final proceeds were received from the sale of previously impaired machinery and equipment, which have been included in asset impairment charges.
764401_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	During 2014, the Company recorded $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the ASW Acquisition for legal, accounting and other professional fees.
764401_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, the Company held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
764401_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The financial assets held by the Company and the fair value hierarchy used to determine their fair values are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	The carrying amount of the Company s cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value the Company would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, the Company had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis other than the assets and liabilities that were acquired from ASW at fair value (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The primary components of the Company s intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Amortization expense for intangibles was $438,000 in 2014, $163,000 in 2013 and $0 in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Amortization expense for the next five years, assuming no change in estimated useful lives of identified intangible assets, is $866,000 in 2015, $866,000 in 2016, $861,000 in 2017, $629,000 in 2018 and $414,000 in 2019.
764401_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company has a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement its operating cash flow and fund its working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	On February 6, 2012, the Company and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an amendment agreement that, among other changes, increased the commitment amount of the Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extended the maturity date from June 2, 2015 to June 2, 2016.
764401_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	As of September 27, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $89.7 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.5 million.
764401_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	As of September 28, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at the election of the Company, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.50% - 1.25% for index rate loans and 1.50% - 2.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	Based on the Company s excess availability as of September 27, 2014, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.50% for index rate loans and 1.50% for LIBOR loans.
764401_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company s ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if the Company is unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $13.5 million.
764401_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict the Company s ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of the Company s stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with affiliates of the Company; or permit liens to encumber the Company s property and assets.
764401_14_ITEM8_P61_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur with respect to the Company upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company; certain entries of judgment against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control of the Company.
764401_14_ITEM8_P61_S4	As of September 27, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the credit facility was $102,000 in 2014, $102,000 in 2013 and $97,000 in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.4 million and $4.3 million as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively.
764401_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company expects the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	As part of the consideration for the acquisition of Ivy, on November 19, 2010 the Company entered into a $13.5 million secured subordinated promissory note (the Note ) payable to Ivy over five years.
764401_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Note required semi-annual interest payments in arrears, and annual principal payments payable on November 19 of each year during the period 2011 - 2015.
764401_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	The Note yielded interest on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum and was collateralized by certain of the real property and equipment acquired from Ivy.
764401_14_ITEM8_P63_S3	On December 12, 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining balance that was outstanding on the Note for $12.4 million, which represented a discount of $425,000 that was recorded as a gain from the early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations in 2012.
764401_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	As of September 27, 2014, there were 387,000 shares available for future grants under the plans.
764401_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Options granted under these plans generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	Compensation expense and excess tax benefits associated with stock options are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options at September 27, 2014 was $454,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.40 years.
764401_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
764401_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $7.00, $7.06 and $5.20 per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
764401_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience.
764401_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
764401_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	The dividend yield was calculated based on the Company s annual dividend as of the option grant date.
764401_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on the Company s stock.
764401_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term.
764401_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity:
764401_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The 2014 and 2013 stock option exercises included net exercises, pursuant to which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
764401_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	On January 21, 2009, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a change in the equity compensation program such that awards of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to employees and directors would be made in lieu of awards of restricted stock.
764401_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	RSUs granted under these plans are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense.
764401_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	The vesting period for RSUs is generally one year from the date of grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to employees.

764401_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The fair values of the Delaware Plan s assets as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 are as follows:
764401_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	Equity securities are primarily direct investments in the stock of publicly-traded companies that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded.
764401_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	Fixed income securities are government and corporate debt securities that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded.

764401_14_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

764401_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

764401_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, PC strand sales represented 43%, 38% and 37%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a replacement for hot-rolled rebar due to the cost advantages that it offers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, WWR sales represented 57%, 62% and 63%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our outside sales representatives are trained in the technical applications of our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories.
764401_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We sell our products nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering our products primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	In fiscal 2015, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as a high percentage of our customers sell into both the nonresidential and residential construction sectors.
764401_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	There were no customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the Company is not dependent on a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect.
764401_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Backlog is minimal for our business because of the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders existing on October 3, 2015 will be shipped prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
764401_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications and actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, although we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, the highest level of shipments within the year typically occurs when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, the level of construction activity tends to be correlated with general economic conditions although there can be significant differences between the relative performance of the nonresidential and residential construction sectors for extended periods.
764401_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our end products.
764401_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pricing for wire rod tends to fluctuate based on both domestic and global market conditions.
764401_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 represented approximately 29% and 30%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that the substantial volume of our wire rod requirements, our desirable mix of sizes and grades, and our strong financial condition represents a competitive advantage by making us a more attractive customer to our suppliers relative to our competitors.
764401_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	These laws generally require a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	The relative supply and demand conditions in our markets determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We believe that we are the largest domestic producer of PC strand and WWR.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Steel Wire Co., Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	Market participants compete on the basis of price, quality and service.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S5	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc., Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S6	Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Strand-Tech Martin, Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_15_ITEM1_P26_S7	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market.
764401_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	In 2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and geographic footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low cost production capabilities and sophisticated information systems, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of October 3, 2015, we employed 790 people.
764401_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Company has no contracts with labor unions and has not experienced any work stoppages.
764401_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
764401_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	Should we experience a disruption of production, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.
764401_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	For information with respect to revenue, operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business and geographic areas, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	Although we expect to incur some environmental control facility costs during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in connection with our expansion of the Houston facility, we do not expect these capital expenditures to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our executive officers are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	H. O. Woltz III, 59, was elected Chief Executive Officer in 1991 and has been employed by us and our subsidiaries in various capacities since 1978.
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	He was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1989.
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	He served as our Vice President from 1988 to 1989 and as President of Rappahannock Wire Company, formerly a subsidiary of our Company, from 1981 to 1989.
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	Mr. Woltz has been a Director since 1986 and also serves as President of Insteel Wire Products Company.
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	Mr. Woltz served as President of Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., formerly a subsidiary of our Company, until its merger with Insteel Wire Products Company in 2002.
764401_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	Mr. Woltz serves on the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2009.
764401_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Michael C. Gazmarian, 56, was elected Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in February 2007.
764401_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	He had previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since 1994, the year he joined us.
764401_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Gazmarian had been employed by Guardian Industries Corp., a privately-held manufacturer of glass, automotive and building products, since 1986, serving in various financial capacities.
764401_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	James F. Petelle, 65, joined us in October 2006.
764401_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	He was elected Vice President and Assistant Secretary on November 14, 2006 and Vice President - Administration and Secretary on January 12, 2007.
764401_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	He was previously employed by Andrew Corporation, a publicly-held manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, having served as Secretary from 1990 to May 2006, and Vice President - Law from 2000 to October 2006.
764401_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Richard T. Wagner, 56, joined us in 1992 and has served as Vice President and General Manager of the Concrete Reinforcing Products Business Unit of the Company s subsidiary, Insteel Wire Products Company, since 1998.
764401_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	From 1977 until 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products that was later acquired by the Company in 2000.
764401_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 17, 2015 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 11, 2016.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Tightening in the credit markets could unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second fiscal quarters primarily due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather conditions on construction activity and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our customers may be adversely affected by negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Furthermore, a reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2015.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our earnings and cash flow from operations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand in most market environments.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to u nexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses .
764401_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, on January 21, 2014, a fire occurred at the Company s Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility, damaging a portion of the facility and requiring the temporary curtailment of operations until the necessary repairs were completed.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and is expected to increase our employee health care costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	This legislation requires certain large employers like the Company to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Provisions of this law have become and will become effective at various dates over the next several years and many of the regulations and guidance for the law have not been implemented.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Due to the breadth and complexity of this law, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the requirement, we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our results.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers compensation plans could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill .
764401_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets primarily related to the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions as part of our growth strategy.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization and lower than projected operating results and cash flows.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If our review determined that goodwill had been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	During fiscal 2015, our common stock traded as high as $24.85 and as low as $14.61.
764401_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual financial results; changes in our business outlook and the expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Insteel s corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	At October 3, 2015, we operated ten manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate except for the facility located in Houston, Texas, which we currently lease from ASW with an option to purchase in the future.
764401_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected needs for our existing products.
764401_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 26, 2015, there were 716 shareholders of record.
764401_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2015 and 2014:
764401_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
764401_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended October 3, 2015.
764401_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on October 2, 2010 in each of our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index, and that all dividends were reinvested.
764401_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	On November 18, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to buy back up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
764401_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
764401_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence or suspend the program at any time at our discretion without prior notice.
764401_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	The share repurchase authorization continues in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors.
764401_15_ITEM5_P4_S3	As of October 3, 2015, there was $24.8 million remaining available for future share repurchases under this authorization.
764401_15_ITEM5_P4_S4	We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2015 and 2014.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	On April 21, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, effective April 25, 2009, amending the Rights Agreement dated as of April 27, 1999 between us and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, successor to First Union National Bank.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	No. 1 and the Rights Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Rights Agreement.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S2	In connection with adopting the Rights Agreement, on April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S3	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S4	Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us on certain dates described in the Rights Agreement one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement.
764401_15_ITEM5_P5_S5	For more information regarding our Rights Agreement, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	As summarized more fully in Item 7 below, on August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW.
764401_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	This transaction may materially affect the comparability of the information reflected in the selected financial data presented in this Item 6.
764401_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million.
764401_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, the production equipment at its facility in Houston, Texas and its production equipment and facility in Newnan, Georgia.
764401_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also entered into an agreement pursuant to which we lease the Houston facility from ASW with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan facility, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such, are excluded from revenue.
764401_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position, cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling cost when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our balance sheet.
764401_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We monitor our operating results throughout the year to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant any interim impairment testing.
764401_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Otherwise, goodwill will be subject to the required annual impairment test during our fourth quarter.
764401_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including the expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could reduce our estimated fair value in the future and result in an impairment of goodwill.
764401_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	There was no goodwill impairment loss recognized in 2015.
764401_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We are involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock option grants and restricted stock units, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
764401_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant.
764401_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The compensation cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions such as expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates to determine the stock options fair value.
764401_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Assumptions for employee benefit plans .
764401_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	We account for our defined employee benefit plans, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ) and the supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.
764401_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.
764401_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	The discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The discount rate for the Delaware Plan and SERPs was 4.25% for 2015 and 2014, and 4.75% for 2013.
764401_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations.
764401_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year.
764401_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The amount of net periodic pension cost or benefit that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year.
764401_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	We regularly review our actual asset allocation and, when appropriate, rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation.
764401_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the assumed long-term rate of return utilized for the Delaware Plan assets was 8%.
764401_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	We currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long-term return on plan assets in fiscal 2016.
764401_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	In determining the appropriateness of this assumption, we considered the historical rate of return on the plan assets, the current and projected asset mix, our investment objectives and information provided by our third-party investment advisors.
764401_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually.
764401_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss.
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains.
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	Under GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees).
764401_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above.
764401_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the Delaware Plan are reasonable and appropriate.
764401_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The funding requirements for the Delaware Plan are based upon applicable regulations, and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under ASC Topic 715 for financial reporting purposes.
764401_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made contributions totaling $234,000, $240,000 and $307,000, respectively, to the Delaware Plan.
764401_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2016 to be $32,000 for the Delaware Plan and $676,000 for the SERPs.
764401_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Cash contributions to the plans during fiscal 2016 are expected to be $246,000 for the Delaware Plan and $290,000 for the SERPs.
764401_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the Delaware Plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 3, 2015 by approximately $106,000 and have no impact on our expected net periodic pension cost for 2016.
764401_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 3, 2015 by approximately $245,000 and $199,000, respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2016 by approximately $25,000.
764401_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Delaware Plan would have increased our expected net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2016 by approximately $6,000.
764401_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.

764401_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Shipments for the year increased 10.0% while average selling prices decreased 0.5% from the prior year levels.
764401_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily driven by the additional business provided by the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Sales for both years reflect reduced volumes relative to prerecession levels in our construction end-markets.
764401_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross profit increased 19.6% to $58.3 million, or 13.0% of net sales, in 2015 from $48.8 million, or 11.9% of net sales, in 2014.
764401_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($11.4 million) and higher shipments ($5.3 million) partially offset by higher unit conversion costs ($7.0 million).
764401_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($13.2 million) and freight expense ($0.9 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($2.7 million).
764401_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Gross profit for both years was unfavorably impacted by reduced shipment volumes and elevated unit conversion costs relative to prerecession levels largely driven by reduced operating schedules.

764401_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in the current year.
764401_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase in amortization expense was primarily associated with the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily due to higher employee health insurance and supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $39,000 in the current year period compared with $513,000 in the prior year period due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.

764401_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions and increased demand for our products relative to the prior year as well as the additional business provided by the ASW Acquisition for a portion of our fourth quarter.
764401_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	Sales for both years reflect reduced volumes relative to the prerecession levels in our construction end-markets.
764401_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Gross profit increased 24.3% to $48.8 million, or 11.9% of net sales, in 2014 from $39.2 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in 2013.
764401_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($6.8 million) and higher shipments ($5.4 million), partially offset by higher unit conversion costs ($1.2 million).
764401_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($8.5 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($1.4 million) and higher freight expense ($0.3 million).

764401_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in 2014.
764401_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily due to higher employee health insurance costs during 2014.
764401_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	The increase in amortization expense was related to the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	The increase in bad debt expense was due to an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts driven by the increase in sales and accounts receivable.
764401_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net restructuring charges of $1.2 million were incurred in 2014 for employee separation costs associated with staffing reductions that were implemented in connection with the ASW Acquisition.

764401_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Interest expense increased 7.2% to $252,000 in 2014 from $235,000 in 2013 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding during 2014.
764401_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% in 2014 compared with 34.8% in 2013 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net earnings increased to $16.6 million ($0.89 per diluted share) in 2014 from $11.7 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2013 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense together with the acquisition costs and restructuring charges associated with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Operating activities provided $35.8 million of cash in 2015 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Net working capital provided $2.3 million of cash due to a $15.9 million decrease in inventories and a $4.3 million decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a $17.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	The decrease in accounts receivable was related to lower selling prices.
764401_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operating activities provided $29.2 million of cash in 2014 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.

764401_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was largely related to changes in the mix of vendor payments and terms.
764401_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by a reduction in days sales outstanding.
764401_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	We may elect to adjust our operating activities as there are changes in the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Investing activities used $3.0 million of cash in 2015, $40.4 million in 2014 and $6.3 million in 2013.
764401_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	In 2015, $7.2 million of cash was used for capital expenditures and $1.5 million for the acquisition of an intangible asset from a competitor, which was partially offset by $3.5 million of proceeds from the sale of the real estate and certain of the equipment associated with the Newnan facility, $1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the Gallatin fire and $0.5 million of post-closing adjustments associated with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	In 2014, $33.9 million of cash was used to fund the ASW Acquisition and $9.0 million for capital expenditures (including $4.5 million to replace property and equipment damaged in the fire at the Gallatin facility), which was partially offset by $2.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the Gallatin fire.
764401_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	In 2013, $5.0 million of cash was used for capital expenditures and $1.9 million for an intangible asset in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from Tatano Wire and Steel, Inc., which was partially offset by $0.6 million of proceeds from life insurance claims.
764401_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Financing activities used $2.5 million of cash in 2015, $1.2 million in 2014 and $15.1 million in 2013.
764401_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	In 2015, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments and $0.2 million for financing costs that were incurred in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility.
764401_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	In 2014, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	In 2013, $11.5 million of cash was used to repay debt and $6.6 million for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $4.5 million and regular cash dividends totaling $2.1 million), which was partially offset by $3.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend the maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of October 3, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $80.3 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.6 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	During 2015, ordinary course borrowings on the Credit Facility were as high as $16.2 million.
764401_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	As of September 27, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility.
764401_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we require additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	During 2015, wire rod prices declined throughout most of the year due to reductions in the cost of scrap for wire rod producers which favorably impacted our margins after the higher cost inventory had been consumed.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S4	During 2014 and 2013, wire rod prices fluctuated within a narrower range, and inflation did not have a material impact on our sales or earnings.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S5	Our ability to fully recover increases in wire rod prices over this period was mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the reduced level of activity in our construction end-markets.
764401_15_ITEM7_P69_S6	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at October 3, 2015 are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	As we look ahead to 2016, we expect further improvement in our financial results driven by the favorable conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced unit conversion costs at our facilities.
764401_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The outlook for private nonresidential construction, our primary demand driver, remains positive and we expect the ongoing recovery will result in higher shipment volumes and operating levels.
764401_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	The prospects for infrastructure construction are less clear pending the enactment of a new multi-year federal transportation funding authorization, although increased spending at the state and local level should serve to mitigate the impact of continued delays in arriving at a longer-term funding solution.
764401_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	We continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	We expect that our financial results will be favorably impacted by the realization of additional operating synergies associated with the ASW Acquisition and related reconfiguration of our PC strand operations.
764401_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ).
764401_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	In addition, we will continue to pursue further acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our geographic footprint.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time, depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, should wire rod costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2015 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a $27.3 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we were debt-free as of October 3, 2015, future borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of October 3, 2015.
764401_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2015, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

764401_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Fiscal year 2015 was a 53-week fiscal year, and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 were 52-week fiscal years.
764401_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	All references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.
764401_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
764401_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
764401_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. and such accounting principles, GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
764401_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	There is no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates.
764401_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
764401_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Concentration of c redit r isk .
764401_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company s cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which its cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_15_ITEM8_P16_S3	The Company invests excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The majority of the Company s accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S., and the Company generally requires no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
764401_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and are thus excluded from revenue.
764401_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company includes all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
764401_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The valuation of inventory includes the costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
764401_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired through acquisitions, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; and land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $10.9 million in 2015, $9.8 million in 2014 and $9.7 million in 2013 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	No interest costs were capitalized in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	The Company performs its annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S3	The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S4	The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S5	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S6	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of the Company s annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on the Company s estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_15_ITEM8_P28_S7	In developing these assumptions, the Company considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity.
764401_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods.
764401_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	Based on the results of the Company s impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for 2015 .
764401_15_ITEM8_P29_S3	Subsequent to the analysis, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company s goodwill balance.
764401_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Other assets consist principally of capitalized financing costs and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.
764401_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Company s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how and non-competition agreements that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their finite useful lives (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	When the Company determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, it measures recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_15_ITEM8_P31_S5	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	During 2015, the Company recorded $0.3 million of impairment charges related to long-lived assets resulting from the consolidation of its PC strand operations with the closure of its Newnan, Georgia facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	There were no impairment losses in 2014 and 2013.
764401_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Fair value of financial instruments .
764401_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income.
764401_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets to the extent the Company no longer believes it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
764401_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company is evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
764401_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
764401_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	ASU No. 2015-11 will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
764401_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	On August 15, 2014, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million, net of post-closing adjustments of $480,000 (the ASW Acquisition ).
764401_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia.
764401_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, the production equipment at its facility in Houston and its production equipment and facility in Newnan.
764401_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Pursuant to an agreement with ASW, the Company is leasing the Houston facility from ASW with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	In addition, the Company assumed certain of ASW s accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to its PC strand business.
764401_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Following is a summary of the Company s final allocation of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the ASW Acquisition:
764401_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	In connection with the ASW Acquisition, the Company acquired intangible assets consisting of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how, and a non-competition agreement.
764401_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The ASW Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	Acquisition and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, but are recorded as expenses in the period in which such costs are incurred (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Following the ASW Acquisition, net sales of the ASW facilities in 2014 were approximately $7.3 million.
764401_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The actual amount of net sales specifically attributable to the ASW Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to the actions that were taken by the Company to integrate ASW s facilities with its existing operations, which involved the reassignment of business across locations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company has determined that the presentation of ASW s earnings for 2014 is impractical due to the integration of ASW s facilities into the Company following the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects the combined results of operations of the Company had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013.
764401_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the ASW Acquisition, including adjusted amortization and depreciation expense based on the fair value of the assets acquired, interest expense related to the borrowings on the Company s revolving credit facility and an appropriate adjustment for the acquisition-related costs in the current year.
764401_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	The pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the ASW Acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that may have been achieved had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
764401_15_ITEM8_P46_S4	The pro forma combined results of operations for the comparative prior year periods are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Subsequent to the ASW Acquisition, in 2014, the Company incurred employee separation costs for staffing reductions associated with the acquisition.
764401_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	In February 2015, the Company elected to consolidate its PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility that had been acquired through the ASW Acquisition, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2015 and 2014:
764401_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	As of October 3, 2015, the Company recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $0.7 million on its consolidated balance sheet, including $0.5 million in accrued expenses and $0.2 million in other liabilities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	As of September 27, 2014 the Company recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $1.2 million on its consolidated balance sheet, including $0.5 million in accrued expenses and $0.7 million in other liabilities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Company does not currently expect to incur any significant restructuring charges during 2016.
764401_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	During 2014, the Company recorded $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the ASW Acquisition for legal, accounting and other professional fees.
764401_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	As of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
764401_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The financial assets held by the Company and the fair value hierarchy used to determine their fair values are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The carrying amount of the Company s cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value the Company would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	As of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis other than the assets and liabilities that were acquired from ASW at fair value (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The primary components of the Company s intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization are as follows:
764401_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Amortization expense for intangibles was $1,056,000 in 2015, $438,000 in 2014 and $163,000 in 2013.
764401_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Amortization expense for the next five years, assuming no change in estimated useful lives of identified intangible assets, is $1.2 million in 2016, $1.1 million in 2017, $918,000 in 2018, $705,000 in 2019 and $537,000 in 2020.
764401_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company has a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement its operating cash flow and fund its working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	In May 2015, the Company amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	As of October 3, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $80.3 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.6 million.
764401_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	As of September 27, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at the election of the Company, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.25% to 0.75% for index rate loans and 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans.
764401_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	Based on the Company s excess availability as of October 3, 2015, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.25% for index rate loans and 1.25% for LIBOR loans.
764401_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company s ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if the Company is unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $12.5 million.
764401_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict the Company s ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of the Company s stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with affiliates of the Company; or permit liens to encumber the Company s property and assets.
764401_15_ITEM8_P63_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur with respect to the Company upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company; certain entries of judgment against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control of the Company.
764401_15_ITEM8_P63_S4	As of October 3, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the credit facility was $89,000 in 2015, $102,000 in 2014 and $102,000 in 2013.
764401_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.5 million and $4.4 million as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively.
764401_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	The Company expects the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Effective February 17, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the 2015 Plan ), which authorizes up to 900,000 shares of Company common stock for future grants under the plan.
764401_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	The 2015 Plan, which expires on February 17, 2025, replaces the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc., which expired on February 15, 2015.
764401_15_ITEM8_P65_S3	As of October 3, 2015, there were 711,000 shares of Company common stock available for future grants under the 2015 Plan, which is the Company s only active equity incentive plan.
764401_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Under the Company s equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Options granted under these plans generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	Compensation expense associated with stock options is as follows:

764401_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	For fiscal 2016, we estimate that approximately 85% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 15% were related to residential construction.
764401_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate ten manufacturing facilities that are all located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers and raw material suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our growth strategy is focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation ( ASW ) for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million (the ASW Acquisition ).
764401_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, production equipment at its facilities in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia, and the Newnan facility.
764401_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	We also entered into an agreement with ASW to lease the Houston facility with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan facility, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of two product lines: PC strand and WWR.
764401_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Based on the criteria specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have one reportable segment.
764401_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	PC strand is a high strength, seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Its high tensile strength allows for the casting of longer spans and thinner sections.
764401_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, PC strand sales represented 39%, 43% and 38%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a lower cost reinforcing solution than hot-rolled rebar.
764401_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, WWR sales represented 61%, 57% and 62%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our outside sales representatives are trained on the technical applications for our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories.
764401_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering them primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	In fiscal 2016, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as most of our customers sell products that are used for both nonresidential and residential construction, and the same products can be used for different end uses.
764401_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	We did not have any customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, and are not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
764401_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Backlog for our business is minimal due to the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders as of the end of fiscal 2016 will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
764401_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, shipments typically reach their highest level of the year when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	As a result, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, construction activity and demand for our products is generally correlated with general economic conditions, although there can be significant differences between the relative strength of nonresidential and residential construction for extended periods.
764401_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our products.
764401_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Wire rod prices tend to fluctuate based on changes in scrap and other metallic prices for steel producers together with domestic and global market conditions.
764401_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 represented approximately 30% and 29%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe that our substantial wire rod requirements, desirable mix of sizes and grades, and strong financial condition represent a competitive advantage by making us a relatively more attractive customer to our suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	These laws generally prescribe a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	Ultimately the relative supply - demand balance in our markets and competitive dynamics determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	We are the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our markets are highly competitive based on price, quality and service.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc. ( Keystone ), Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Keystone), Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S5	Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Keystone and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_16_ITEM1_P24_S6	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market that are not subject to Buy America requirements.
764401_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2003, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	In 2010, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and national footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low-cost production capabilities, sophisticated information systems and financial strength and flexibility, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	As of October 1, 2016, we had 848 employees, none of which were represented by labor unions.
764401_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	In the event of production disruptions, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and financial results.
764401_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our products are used in applications that are subject to inherent risks, including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications.
764401_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Although actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	We expect to make capital outlays for environmental control processes associated with our expansion of the Houston facility during fiscal 2017, but do not expect these expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports, are available at no cost on our web site at http://investor.insteel.com/sec.cfm and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports electronically with, or furnish them to, the SEC.
764401_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not incorporated into this report or any of our filings with the SEC.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole and increasing the risk of payment defaults on our outstanding customer balances.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow s .
764401_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2016.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a considerable impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand in most market environments.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to u nexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses .
764401_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, during fiscal 2014, a fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility damaged a portion of the plant and required the temporary curtailment of operations until the necessary repairs were completed.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure, or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Consistent with the experience of other employers, our medical and workers compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and increase our employee health care costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	This legislation requires certain large employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Provisions of this law have become and will become effective at various dates over the next several years and many of the regulations and guidance for the law have not been implemented.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Due to the breadth and complexity of this law, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the requirement, we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our results.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, increasing prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For most of our business, we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill .
764401_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets primarily related to the ASW Acquisition, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization and lower than projected operating results and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If our review determines that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	During fiscal 2016, our common stock traded as high as $37.22 and as low as $16.19.
764401_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.
764401_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	At October 1, 2016, we operated ten manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate except for the facility located in Houston, which we currently lease from ASW with an option to purchase in the future.
764401_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected demand for our products.
764401_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

764401_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on NASDAQ since September 28, 2004.
764401_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 25, 2016, there were 675 shareholders of record.
764401_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2016 and 2015:
764401_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.
764401_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	In addition to the regular quarterly cash dividend, we paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
764401_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
764401_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended October 1, 2016.
764401_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on October 1, 2011 in our common stock and in each of the two indices and the reinvestment of all dividends.
764401_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Information regarding our share repurchase authorization is discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Information regarding our Rights Agreement is discussed in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	As summarized more fully in Item 7 below, on August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW.
764401_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	This transaction may materially affect the comparability of the information reflected in the selected financial data presented in this Item 6.
764401_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	On August 15, 2014, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million.
764401_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, production equipment at its facilities in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia, and the Newnan facility.
764401_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also entered into an agreement to lease the Houston facility from ASW with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan facility, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following critical accounting policies are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and are generally not secured by collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as the financial position, cash flows and payment history of our customers as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances for losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling cost when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our balance sheet.
764401_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	We monitor our operating results throughout the year to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant any interim impairment testing.
764401_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Otherwise, goodwill will be subject to the required annual impairment test during our fourth quarter.
764401_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including the expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could reduce our estimated fair value in the future and result in an impairment of goodwill.
764401_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	There was no goodwill impairment loss recognized in fiscal 2016.
764401_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We are involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock option grants and restricted stock units, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
764401_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions for the expected term, volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and forfeiture rates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Assumptions for employee benefit plan .
764401_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	We account for our supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.
764401_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension cost and value liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate.
764401_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The discount rate we utilize for determining net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligation for the SERPs is based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	The discount rate is used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	The discount rate for the SERPs was 3.75% for fiscal 2016 and 4.25% for fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The assumed discount rate is reevaluated annually.
764401_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Changes in this assumption can result in the recognition of a materially different pension cost over different periods and a materially different liability amount in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2017 to be $856,000 for the SERPs.
764401_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Cash contributions to the SERPs during fiscal 2017 are expected to be $290,000.
764401_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 1, 2016 by approximately $290,000 and $224,000, respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2017 by approximately $30,000.
764401_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for the related accounting and disclosures surrounding our terminated pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net sales decreased 6.5% to $418.5 million in 2016 from $447.5 million in 2015 as a 2.6% increase in shipments was offset by an 8.8% reduction in average selling prices.
764401_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Shipments for the prior year benefited from an extra week based on our fiscal calendar.
764401_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	On a pro forma basis adjusting both years to reflect the same 52-week period as 2016, the year-over-year shipment increase was 4.8%.
764401_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions and increased demand for our products relative to the prior year.
764401_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	The decrease in average selling prices was driven by competitive pricing pressures.
764401_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gross profit increased 46.0% to $85.2 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016 from $58.3 million, or 13.0% of net sales, in 2015.
764401_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($22.3 million), lower unit conversion costs ($2.3 million) and the increase in shipments ($1.6 million).
764401_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($62.4 million) and freight expense ($0.5 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($40.6 million).
764401_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) increased 0.9% to $26.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2016 from $25.8 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2015 primarily due to higher compensation expense ($1.8 million) which was partially offset by lower employee benefit ($657,000), bad debt ($250,000) and legal expense ($114,000), together with the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($441,000).
764401_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in the current year.
764401_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease in employee benefit costs was primarily related to a reduction in high-dollar health insurance claims.
764401_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	The decrease in bad debt expense was due to favorable collections experience.
764401_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $480,000 in the current year period compared with $39,000 in the prior year period due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	A pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was incurred in 2016 related to the termination of the Delaware Plan.
764401_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net restructuring charges of $115,000 were incurred in 2016 related to the consolidation of our PC strand facilities, including equipment relocation costs ($186,000), facility closure costs ($89,000) and impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($20,000) partially offset by a gain on the sale of equipment previously associated with the Newnan, Georgia PC strand facility ($180,000).
764401_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Net restructuring charges of $349,000 were incurred in 2015 related to the closure of the Newnan facility, which included facility closure costs ($547,000), impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($543,000), equipment relocation costs ($79,000) and employee separation costs ($75,000).

764401_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Other expense for 2016 was $0.2 million compared with other income of $1.1 million in 2015.
764401_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The other income for 2015 was primarily related to a $1.7 million net gain from insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment damaged in the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand facility in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million charge related to the settlement of a customer dispute.
764401_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Interest expense decreased 50.6% to $158,000 in 2016 from $320,000 in 2015 primarily due to borrowings on our revolving credit facility during the prior year.
764401_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2016 decreased slightly to 33.8% from 34.1% in 2015 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Net earnings increased to $37.2 million ($1.95 per diluted share) in 2016 from $21.7 million ($1.15 per diluted share) in 2015 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense and the pension settlement loss.
764401_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net sales increased 9.4% to $447.5 million in 2015 from $409.0 million in 2014 as a 10.0% increase in shipments was partially offset by a 0.5% reduction in average selling prices from the prior year levels.
764401_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in shipments was primarily driven by the additional business provided by the ASW Acquisition and the extra week in 2015 based on our fiscal calendar.
764401_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	On a pro forma basis adjusting both years to reflect the same 52-week period as 2014, the year-over-year shipment increase was 7.7%.
764401_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Gross profit increased 19.6% to $58.3 million, or 13.0% of net sales, in 2015 from $48.8 million, or 11.9% of net sales, in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($11.4 million) and higher shipments ($5.3 million) partially offset by higher unit conversion costs ($7.0 million).
764401_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($13.2 million) and freight expense ($0.9 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($2.7 million).
764401_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	SG A expense increased 10.5% to $25.8 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2015 from $23.4 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in 2014 primarily due to higher compensation expense ($650,000), amortization expense associated with intangible assets ($619,000) and employee benefit costs ($435,000) together with the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($474,000).
764401_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in 2015.
764401_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in amortization expense was primarily associated with the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily due to higher employee health insurance and supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $39,000 in the current year period compared with $513,000 in the prior year period due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net restructuring charges of $349,000 were incurred in 2015 compared with $1.2 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The net restructuring charges for 2015 were related to the closure of the Newnan, Georgia PC strand facility that was acquired through the ASW Acquisition, including $547,000 for facility closure costs, $543,000 for impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment, $79,000 for equipment relocation costs and $75,000 for employee separation costs.
764401_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	These charges were partially offset by an $895,000 gain on the sale of the real estate and certain of the equipment associated with the Newnan facility.
764401_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	The net restructuring charges for 2014 were for employee separation costs associated with staffing reductions that were implemented in connection with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Acquisition costs of $0.6 million were incurred in 2014 for legal, accounting and other professional fees related to the ASW Acquisition, which were expensed as required under the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.
764401_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Other income for 2015 was $1.1 million compared to $1.9 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The other income for 2015 was primarily related to a $1.7 million net gain from insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment damaged in the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand facility in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million charge related to the settlement of a customer dispute.
764401_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	The other income for 2014 was largely related to a net gain from insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment damaged in the Gallatin fire.
764401_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest expense increased 27.0% to $320,000 in 2015 from $252,000 in 2014 primarily due to higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility during 2015.
764401_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2015 was essentially unchanged at 34.1% compared with 34.0% in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net earnings increased to $21.7 million ($1.15 per diluted share) in 2015 from $16.6 million ($0.89 per diluted share) in 2014 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense.
764401_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Operating activities provided $54.5 million of cash in 2016 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Net working capital provided $3.2 million of cash due to a $9.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in inventories and a $0.6 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventories were largely related to higher raw material purchases near the end of the period.
764401_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding partially offset by lower selling prices.
764401_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Operating activities provided $35.8 million of cash in 2015 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Net working capital provided $2.3 million of cash due to a $15.9 million decrease in inventories and a $4.3 million decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a $17.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	The decrease in accounts receivable was related to lower selling prices.
764401_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Operating activities provided $29.2 million of cash in 2014 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Net working capital provided $2.4 million of cash due to a $21.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $16.8 million increase in inventories and a $2.1 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventories were largely related to higher raw material purchases driven by the increase in sales.
764401_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in sales.
764401_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We may elect to adjust our operating activities as there are changes in the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Investing activities used $13.0 million of cash in 2016, $3.0 million in 2015 and $40.4 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	In 2016, $13.0 million of cash was used for capital expenditures.
764401_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	In 2015, $7.2 million of cash was used for capital expenditures and $1.5 million for the acquisition of an intangible asset from a competitor, which was partially offset by $3.5 million of proceeds from the sale of the real estate and certain of the equipment associated with the Newnan facility, $1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the Gallatin fire and $0.5 million of post-closing adjustments associated with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	In 2014, $33.9 million of cash was used to fund the ASW Acquisition and $9.0 million for capital expenditures (including $4.5 million to replace property and equipment damaged in the fire at the Gallatin facility), which was partially offset by $2.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the Gallatin fire.
764401_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Financing activities used $15.9 million of cash in 2016, $2.5 million in 2015 and $1.2 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	In 2016, $20.9 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $18.6 million, or $1.00 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million), which was partially offset by $5.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	In 2015, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments and $0.2 million for financing costs that were incurred in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility.
764401_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	In 2014, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments, which was partially offset by $1.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend its maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of October 1, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $83.5 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	As of October 3, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities and the borrowing availability provided under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility as required.
764401_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we required additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the second half of 2016, wire rod prices escalated over most of the period due to increasing scrap costs for wire rod producers which we were generally able to recover through price increases for our products.
764401_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	During 2015 and through the first half of 2016, wire rod prices declined through most of the period due to reductions in scrap costs for wire rod producers which favorably impacted our margins after the higher cost inventory we had purchased in earlier periods was consumed.
764401_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	During 2014, wire rod prices fluctuated within a narrower range, and inflation did not have a material impact on our sales or earnings.
764401_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at October 1, 2016 are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	As we look ahead to 2017, the recent macro indicators for our construction end-markets have been mixed and it is unclear whether the softening in shipments we experienced during the latter part of the year will persist.
764401_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	Customer sentiment for the coming year remains positive and we expect to benefit from the higher degree of funding certainty provided by the FAST Act together with increased infrastructure spending at the state and local level.
764401_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	We expect that our financial results will be favorably impacted by the realization of additional operating synergies associated with the ASW Acquisition and the related reconfiguration of our PC strand operations following the anticipated completion of the expansion of our Houston plant by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
764401_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ).
764401_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	In addition, we will continue to pursue further acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, in weaker market environments, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2016 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of wire rod would have resulted in a $21.7 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we did not have any balances outstanding on our Credit Facility as of October 1, 2016, future borrowings under the facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of October 1, 2016.
764401_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2016, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

764401_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	We include all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to us for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
764401_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The valuation of inventory includes the costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
764401_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired through acquisitions, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; and land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $10.4 million in 2016, $10.9 million in 2015 and $9.8 million in 2014 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	No interest costs were capitalized in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S3	The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S4	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S5	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S6	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_16_ITEM8_P29_S7	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity.
764401_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods.
764401_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	Based on the results of our impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for 2016 .
764401_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	Subsequent to the analysis, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of goodwill.
764401_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Other assets consist principally of capitalized financing costs and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.
764401_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
764401_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how and non-competition agreements that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their finite useful lives (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	When we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we measure recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_16_ITEM8_P33_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	During 2016 and 2015, we recorded $20,000 and $0.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges related to long-lived assets resulting from the consolidation of our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Fair value of financial instruments .
764401_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income.
764401_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	We assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows Topic 230: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
764401_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	ASU No. 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing differences in the presentation of these items.
764401_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 are to be adopted retrospectively and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 Compensation Stock Compensation Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	ASU No. 2016-09 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	We are evaluating the future effects of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases, which will replace the guidance in ASC Topic 840.
764401_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	ASU No. 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset.
764401_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	ASU No. 2016-02 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
764401_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	We are evaluating the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
764401_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
764401_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	ASU No. 2015-11 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
764401_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_16_ITEM8_P45_S3	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_16_ITEM8_P45_S4	We are continuing to evaluate the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected a transition method.
764401_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	On August 15, 2014, we purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of ASW for a final adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million, net of post-closing adjustments of $480,000 (the ASW Acquisition ).
764401_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	ASW manufactured PC strand at facilities located in Houston, Texas and Newnan, Georgia.
764401_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	We acquired, among other assets, the accounts receivable and inventories related to ASW s PC strand business, the production equipment at its facilities in Houston and Newnan, and its facility in Newnan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	We also entered into an agreement with ASW to lease the Houston facility with an option to purchase it in the future.
764401_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	In addition, we assumed certain of ASW s accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to its PC strand business.
764401_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Following is a summary of our final allocation of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the ASW Acquisition:
764401_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	In connection with the ASW Acquisition, we acquired intangible assets consisting of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how, and a non-competition agreement.
764401_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	The ASW Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 805, acquisition and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, but are recorded as expenses in the period in which such costs are incurred (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Following the ASW Acquisition, net sales of the ASW facilities in 2014 were approximately $7.3 million.
764401_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	The actual amount of net sales specifically attributable to the ASW Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to the actions that we took to integrate ASW s facilities with our existing operations, which involved the reassignment of business across locations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	We have determined that the presentation of ASW s earnings for 2014 is impractical due to the integration of ASW s facilities with our existing operations following the ASW Acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects our combined results of operations had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013.
764401_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the ASW Acquisition, including adjusted amortization and depreciation expense based on the fair value of the assets acquired, interest expense related to the borrowings on our revolving credit facility and an appropriate adjustment for the acquisition-related costs.
764401_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	The pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the ASW Acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined company that may have been achieved had the ASW Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2013, nor is it intended to represent or be indicative of future results of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P52_S4	The pro forma combined results of operations for the comparative prior year period are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Subsequent to the ASW Acquisition, in 2014, we incurred employee separation costs for staffing reductions associated with the acquisition.
764401_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	In February 2015, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility that had been acquired through the ASW Acquisition, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2016, 2015 and 2014:
764401_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	As of October 1, 2016, we recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $0.3 million on our consolidated balance sheet, including $0.1 million in accounts payable and $0.2 million in accrued expenses.
764401_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	As of October 3, 2015, we recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $0.7 million on our consolidated balance sheet, including $0.5 million in accrued expenses and $0.2 million in other liabilities.
764401_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	We do not currently expect to incur any significant restructuring charges during 2017.
764401_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	During 2014, we recorded $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the ASW Acquisition for legal, accounting and other professional fees.
764401_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	As of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are summarized below:
764401_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The carrying amount of our cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value we would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	As of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, we had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis other than the assets and liabilities that were acquired from ASW at fair value (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The primary components of our intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Amortization expense for intangibles was $1.2 million in 2016, $1.1 million in 2015 and $438,000 in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Amortization expense for the next five years, assuming no change in the estimated useful lives of identified intangible assets, is $1.1 million in 2017, $918,000 in 2018, $705,000 in 2019, $537,000 in 2020 and $414,000 in 2021.
764401_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend its maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	As of October 1, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $83.5 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million.
764401_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	As of October 3, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at our election, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.25% to 0.75% for index rate loans and 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans.
764401_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	Based on our excess availability as of October 1, 2016, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.25% for index rate loans and 1.25% for LIBOR loans.
764401_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if we are unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $12.5 million.
764401_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; or permit liens to encumber our property and assets.
764401_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by us or any of our subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain entries of judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control.
764401_16_ITEM8_P70_S4	As of October 1, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the Credit Facility was $65,000 in 2016, $89,000 in 2015 and $102,000 in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.5 million as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015.
764401_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	We expect the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Under the our equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Effective February 17, 2015, our shareholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the 2015 Plan ), which authorizes up to 900,000 shares of our common stock for future grants under the plan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P72_S2	The 2015 Plan, which expires on February 17, 2025, replaces the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc., which expired on February 15, 2015.
764401_16_ITEM8_P72_S3	As of October 1, 2016, there were 558,000 shares of our common stock available for future grants under the 2015 Plan, which is our only active equity incentive plan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under our equity incentive plans, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Options granted under these plans generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	Compensation expense associated with stock options is as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options at October 1, 2016 was $344,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.51 years.
764401_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
764401_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $9.92, $7.10 and $7.00 per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
764401_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience.
764401_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term.
764401_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
764401_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on our stock.
764401_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	The dividend yield was calculated based on our annual dividend as of the option grant date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity:
764401_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Stock option exercises include net exercises for which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
764401_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) granted under our equity incentive plans are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense.
764401_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	The vesting period for RSUs is generally one year from the date of grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to employees.
764401_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	RSUs do not have voting rights.
764401_16_ITEM8_P80_S3	RSU grants and compensation expense are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs on October 1, 2016 was $584,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.79 years.
764401_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table summarizes RSU activity:
764401_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The reconciliation between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes is as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.
764401_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	Under this update, all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, are required to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
764401_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	Effective January 2, 2016, we early adopted ASU No. 2015-17 on a prospective basis, which resulted in the reclassification of our current deferred tax asset as a non-current deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_16_ITEM8_P86_S3	No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.
764401_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	As of October 1, 2016, we recorded a non-current deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $5.5 million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	As of October 3, 2015, we recorded a current deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) of $1.5 million on our consolidated balance sheet in other current assets and a non-current deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $6.1 million in other liabilities.
764401_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	We have $7.5 million of state operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2017, but principally expire between 2017 and 2031.
764401_16_ITEM8_P87_S3	We have also recorded deferred tax assets for various state tax credits of $87,000, which will begin to expire in 2018 and principally expire between 2018 and 2020.
764401_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The realization of our deferred tax assets is entirely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions.
764401_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	GAAP requires that we periodically assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully utilized.
764401_16_ITEM8_P88_S2	As of October 1, 2016, we had recorded a valuation allowance of $280,000 pertaining to various state NOLs and tax credits that were not expected to be utilized.
764401_16_ITEM8_P88_S3	The valuation allowance is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on changes in facts and circumstances and would be reduced should we utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards against which an allowance had previously been provided or determine that such utilization is more likely than not.
764401_16_ITEM8_P88_S4	The $212,000 decrease in the valuation allowance during 2016 is primarily due to the utilization of state tax credits for which an allowance had been previously recorded.
764401_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	As of October 1, 2016, we had no material, known tax exposures that required the establishment of contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions.
764401_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.
764401_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	There were no interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits incurred during 2016, 2015 and 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	We file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as state and local income tax returns in various jurisdictions.
764401_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	Federal and various state tax returns filed subsequent to 2011 remain subject to examination.
764401_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	We had one defined benefit pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Delaware Plan provided benefits for eligible employees based primarily upon years of service and compensation levels.
764401_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Delaware Plan was frozen effective September 30, 2008 whereby participants no longer earned additional benefits.
764401_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	During the second quarter of 2016, we notified plan participants of our intent to terminate the Delaware Plan effective May 1, 2016.
764401_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	During September 2016, the Delaware Plan settled plan liabilities through either lump sum distributions to plan participants or annuity contracts purchased from a third-party insurance company that provided for the payment of vested benefits to those participants that did not elect the lump sum option.
764401_16_ITEM8_P93_S2	As of October 1, 2016, there were no remaining plan assets.
764401_16_ITEM8_P93_S3	We made contributions totaling $1.9 million, $234,000 and $240,000 to the Delaware Plan during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
764401_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	As a result of the pension termination, unrecognized losses, which previously were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets, were recognized as expense and the pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was recorded on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended October 1, 2016.
764401_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	The reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for the Delaware Plan is as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the Delaware Plan includes the following components:
764401_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the Delaware Plan are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	In establishing the discount rate, we reviewed published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the Delaware Plan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and future expectations of returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the Delaware Plan portfolio.
764401_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Prior to the termination and settlement of the Delaware Plan the fundamental goal underlying the investment policy was to ensure that its assets were invested in a prudent manner to meet its obligations as such obligations became due.
764401_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The primary investment objectives included providing a total return that would promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, diversifying investments across and within asset classes, minimizing the impact of losses in single investments and adhering to investment practices that complied with applicable laws and regulations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	The investment strategy for equities emphasized U.S. large cap equities with the portfolio s performance measured against the S P 500 index or other applicable indices.
764401_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	The investment strategy for fixed income investments was focused on maintaining an overall portfolio with a minimum credit rating of A-1 as well as a minimum rating of any security at the time of purchase of Baa/BBB by Moody s or Standard Poor s, if rated.
764401_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Delaware Plan had a long-term target asset mix of 60% equities and 40% fixed income.
764401_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	The asset allocations for the Delaware Plan in 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of October 3, 2015, the Delaware Plan s assets included equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents, and were required to be measured at fair value.
764401_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	We used a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, defined as follows: Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, thereby requiring the development of valuation assumptions.
764401_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The fair values of the Delaware Plan s assets as of October 3, 2015 were as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Equity securities are primarily direct investments in the stock of publicly-traded companies that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded.
764401_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	Fixed income securities are government and corporate debt securities that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded.
764401_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are money market funds that are valued based on the net asset value as determined by the fund each business day.
764401_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	We have Retirement Security Agreements (each, a SERP ) with certain of our employees (each, a Participant ).
764401_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	Under the SERPs, if the Participant remains in continuous service with us for a period of at least 30 years, we will pay them a supplemental retirement benefit for the 15-year period following their retirement equal to 50% of their highest average annual base salary for five consecutive years in the 10-year period preceding their retirement.
764401_16_ITEM8_P108_S2	If the Participant retires prior to the later of age 65 or the completion of 30 years of continuous service with us, but has completed at least 10 years of continuous service, the amount of their supplemental retirement benefit will be reduced by 1/360th for each month short of 30 years that they were employed by us.
764401_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	In 2005, we revised the SERPs to add Participants and increase benefits to existing Participants.
764401_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized for the SERPs in our consolidated balance sheets is as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the SERPs includes the following components:
764401_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2017 is $174,000.
764401_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the SERPs are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the plan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	The SERPs expected rate of increase in compensation levels is based on the anticipated increases in annual compensation.
764401_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	The projected benefit payments under the SERPs are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	As noted above, the SERPs were revised in 2005 to add Participants and increase benefits to certain existing Participants.
764401_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	However, for certain Participants we still maintain the benefits of the respective SERPs that were in effect prior to the 2005 changes, which entitle them to fixed cash benefits upon retirement at age 65, payable annually for 15 years.
764401_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	These SERPs are supported by life insurance policies on the Participants that are purchased and owned by us.
764401_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	The cash benefits paid under these SERPs were $25,000 in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P118_S4	The expense attributable to these SERPs was $26,000 in 2016, $23,000 in 2015 and $16,000 in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	In 1996, we adopted the Retirement Savings Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the Plan ) to provide retirement benefits and stock ownership for our employees.
764401_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	The Plan is an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
764401_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	As allowed under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees.
764401_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Plan allows for discretionary contributions to be made by us as determined by the Board of Directors, which are allocated among eligible participants based on their compensation relative to the total compensation of all participants .
764401_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	Employees are permitted to contribute up to 75% of their annual compensation to the Plan, limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code.
764401_16_ITEM8_P121_S2	During 2014 to 2016, we matched employee contributions up to 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of eligible compensation that was contributed by employees.
764401_16_ITEM8_P121_S3	Our contributions to the Plan were $1.0 million in 2016 and 2015 and $0.9 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations ( VEBA ) .
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	We have a VEBA which allows both us and our employees to make contributions to pay for medical costs.
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S2	Our contributions to the VEBA were $5.4 million in 2016, $6.3 million in 2015 and $4.6 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S3	We are primarily self-insured for our employee s healthcare costs, carrying stop-loss insurance coverage for individual claims in excess of $175,000 per benefit plan year.
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S4	Our self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims.
764401_16_ITEM8_P122_S5	We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates.
764401_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	On January 21, 2014, a fire occurred at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility, damaging a portion of the facility and requiring the temporary curtailment of operations until the necessary repairs were completed.
764401_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	In response, we reassigned a portion of our strand production requirements to our facility located in Sanderson, Florida, which was operating at a reduced utilization level.
764401_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the remainder of the repairs and the Gallatin facility was fully operational.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	We maintained general liability, business interruption and replacement cost property insurance coverage on our facilities that was sufficient to cover the losses incurred from the fire.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	We received $2.0 million and $6.7 million of insurance proceeds in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the expenses that were incurred and capital outlays that were required to replace property and equipment damaged in the fire.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S2	During 2015, the insurance proceeds attributable to the additional expenses incurred were recorded in cost of sales ($244,000) and SG A expense ($69,000) on our consolidated statement of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S3	During 2014, the insurance proceeds attributable to the additional expenses were recorded in cost of sales ($3.9 million) and SG A expense ($147,000) on our consolidated statement of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S4	The insurance proceeds attributable to the property and equipment damaged in the fire were reported in cash flows from investing activities and all other insurance proceeds received were reported in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM8_P124_S5	We reached a final settlement on this claim with our insurance carrier during the third quarter of 2015.
764401_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	We lease a portion of our equipment and our facility in Houston, Texas under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2020.
764401_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	Under most lease agreements, we pay insurance, taxes and maintenance.
764401_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	Rental expense for operating leases was $1.8 million in 2016 and in 2015 and $1.2 million in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	As of October 1, 2016, minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year are payable as follows: 2017, $1.4 million; 2018, $742,000; 2019, $260,000; 2020 $50,000 and 2021 and beyond, $0.
764401_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of October 1, 2016 , we had $26.8 million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw material extending as long as approximately 100 days and $11.6 million of contractual commitments for the purchase of certain equipment that had not been fulfilled and are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	During 2015, we settled a dispute with a customer resulting in a $0.7 million charge that was recorded in other expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	We do not expect the ultimate cost to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	Seve rance and change of control a greements.
764401_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	We have entered into severance agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that provide them with certain termination benefits in the event their employment with us is terminated without cause.
764401_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	The initial term of each agreement is two years and they automatically renew for successive one year terms unless we or the executive provide notice of termination as specified in the agreement.
764401_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	In the event of termination of the executive s employment without cause, these agreements provide that they would receive termination benefits equal to one and one-half times their annual base salary in effect on the termination date and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for eighteen months.
764401_16_ITEM8_P130_S3	In addition, all of the executive s stock options and restricted stock would vest immediately, and outplacement services would be provided.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	We have also entered into change in control agreements with key members of management, including our executive officers, which specify the terms of separation in the event that termination of their employment followed a change in control.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	The initial term of each agreement is two years and they automatically renew for successive one year terms unless we or the executive provide notice of termination as specified in the agreement.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	The agreements do not provide assurances of continued employment or specify the terms of an executive s termination should one occur in the absence of a change in control.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S3	The compensation payable under the terms of these agreements differs between the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and the other covered executives.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S4	In the event of termination of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer within two years of a change of control, they would receive severance benefits equal to two times base compensation, two times the average bonus for the prior three years and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for two years.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S5	In the event of such a termination of the other key members of management, including our other two executive officers, within two years of a change of control, they would receive severance benefits equal to one times base compensation, one times the average bonus for the prior three years and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for one year.
764401_16_ITEM8_P131_S6	In addition, for any covered executive that is terminated within two years of a change of control, all of their stock options and restricted stock would vest immediately, and outplacement services would be provided.
764401_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders is as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	Options representing 51,000 shares in 2016, 144,000 shares in 2015 and 120,000 shares in 2014 were antidilutive and were not included in the diluted EPS computation.
764401_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of two product lines: PC strand and WWR.
764401_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Based on the criteria specified in ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have one reportable segment.

764401_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	Our net sales by product line are as follows:
764401_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	There were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	Sales to a company affiliated with one of our directors amounted to $420,000 in 2016, $361,000 in 2015 and $459,000 in 2014.
764401_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	On April 26, 1999, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right per share of our outstanding common stock as of May 17, 1999 pursuant to a Rights Agreement, dated as of April 27, 1999.
764401_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	The Rights Agreement also provides that one right will attach to each share of our common stock issued after May 17, 1999.
764401_16_ITEM8_P140_S2	On April 21, 2009, effective April 25, 2009, our Board of Directors amended the Rights Agreement to, among other changes, extend the final expiration date and adjust the purchase price payable upon exercise of a right.
764401_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	The rights are not currently exercisable but trade with our common stock shares and become exercisable on the distribution date.
764401_16_ITEM8_P141_S1	The distribution date will occur upon the earliest of 10 business days following a public announcement that either a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an acquiring person ) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more (after adjustment for certain derivative transactions) of the outstanding shares of common stock (the stock acquisition date ), or of a tender offer or exchange offer that would, if consummated, result in an acquiring person beneficially owning 20% or more of such outstanding shares of common stock, subject to certain limitations.
764401_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	Each right will entitle the holder, other than the acquiring person or group, to purchase one two-hundredths of a share (a Unit ) of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock ) at a purchase price of $46 per Unit, subject to adjustment as described in the Rights Agreement (the purchase price ).
764401_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	At the time specified, each holder of a right will have the right to receive in lieu of Preferred Stock, upon exercise and payment of the purchase price, common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the purchase price or, at the discretion of the Board, upon exercise and without payment of the purchase price, common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to the difference between the purchase price and the value of the consideration which a person exercising the right and paying the purchase price would receive.
764401_16_ITEM8_P142_S2	Rights that are or (under specified circumstances) were, beneficially owned by any acquiring person will be null and void.
764401_16_ITEM8_P142_S3	The purchase price payable and the number of Units of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the rights are subject to adjustment from time to time.

764401_16_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

764401_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	PC strand is a high strength, seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Its high tensile strength allows for the casting of longer spans and thinner sections.
764401_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, PC strand sales represented 38%, 39% and 43%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a lower cost reinforcing solution than hot-rolled rebar.
764401_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, WWR sales represented 62%, 61% and 57%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our outside sales representatives are trained on the technical applications for our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories.
764401_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering them primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	In fiscal 2017, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as most of our customers sell products that are used for both nonresidential and residential construction, and the same products can be used for different end uses.
764401_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	We did not have any customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, and are not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
764401_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	B acklog for our business is minimal due to the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders as of the end of fiscal 2017 will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, shipments typically reach their highest level of the year when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result, assuming normal seasonal weather patterns, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, construction activity and demand for our products is generally correlated with general economic conditions, although there can be significant differences between the relative strength of nonresidential and residential construction for extended periods.
764401_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Wire rod can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our products.
764401_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Wire rod prices tend to fluctuate based on changes in scrap and other metallic prices for steel producers together with domestic and global market conditions.
764401_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Trade actions initiated by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 27% and 30%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	We believe that our substantial wire rod requirements, desirable mix of sizes and grades, and strong financial condition represent a competitive advantage by making us a relatively more attractive customer to our suppliers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	These laws generally prescribe a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	Ultimately the relative supply - demand balance in our markets and competitive dynamics determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We are the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our markets are highly competitive based on price, quality and service.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc. ( Keystone ), Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Nucor Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation, Engineered Wire Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Keystone), Davis Wire Corporation, Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc., Concrete Reinforcements Inc. and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Keystone and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_17_ITEM1_P23_S6	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market that are not subject to Buy America requirements.
764401_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2003, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	In 2010, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and national footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low-cost production capabilities, sophisticated information systems and financial strength and flexibility, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	As of September 30, 2017, we had 803 employees, none of which were represented by labor unions.
764401_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	In the event of production disruptions, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and financial results.
764401_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our products are used in applications that are subject to inherent risks, including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications.
764401_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Although actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal 2018.
764401_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	O ur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports, are available at no cost on our web site at https://insteelgcs.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports electronically with, or furnish them to, the SEC.
764401_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not incorporated into this report or any of our filings with the SEC.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and c an be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole and increasing the risk of payment defaults on our outstanding customer balances.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow s .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2017.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a considerable impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand in most market environments.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to u nexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, during fiscal 2017, operations at our Texas and Florida plants were temporarily curtailed due to flooding and power outages related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Consistent with the experience of other employers, o ur medical and workers compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and increase our employee health care costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This legislation requires certain large employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Although certain provisions of the ACA were waived in January 2017, others are anticipated to become effective at various dates over the next several years and many of the regulations and guidance pertaining to the law have not been implemented.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Due to the breadth and complexity of the ACA, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the requirement, we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our results.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, increasing prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For most of our business, we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill .
764401_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	During fiscal 2017, our common stock traded as high as $42.81 and as low as $22.50.
764401_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results.

764401_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	Our August 15, 2014 acquisition of substantially all the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation (the ASW Acquisition ) may materially affect the comparability of the information reflected in the selected financial data presented in this Item 6.
764401_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	O ur operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer in our industry; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these consolidated financial statements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following critical accounting policies are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and are generally not secured by collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as the financial position, cash flows and payment history of our customers as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances for losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling cost when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our balance sheet.
764401_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	W e monitor our operating results throughout the year to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant any interim impairment testing.
764401_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Otherwise, goodwill will be subject to the required annual impairment test during our fourth quarter.
764401_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including the expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could reduce our estimated fair value in the future and result in an impairment of goodwill.
764401_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	There was no goodwill impairment loss recognized in fiscal 2017.
764401_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We are involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	We account for stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock option grants and restricted stock units, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
764401_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions for the expected term, volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and forfeiture rates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Assumptions for employee benefit plan .
764401_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We account for our supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.
764401_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension cost and value liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate.
764401_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The discount rate we utilize for determining net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligation for the SERPs is based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	The discount rate is used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	The discount rate for the SERPs was 3.75% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and 4.25% for fiscal 2015.
764401_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The a ssumed discount rate is reevaluated annually.
764401_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Changes in this assumption can result in the recognition of a materially different pension cost over different periods and a materially different liability amount in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2018 to be $806,000 for the SERPs.
764401_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Cash contributions to the SERPs during fiscal 2018 are expected to be $358,000.
764401_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 30, 2017 by approximately $284,000 and $230,000, respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2018 by approximately $31,000.
764401_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for the related accounting and disclosures surrounding our terminated pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net sales decreased 7.1% to $388.9 million in 2017 from $418.5 million in 201 6 due to lower shipments as average selling prices were essentially unchanged.
764401_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Shipments in 2017 were unfavorably impacted by adverse weather conditions during the second half of the year including the effect from hurricanes Harvey and Irma on our Texas and Florida facilities together with a reduction in new project activity and competitive pricing pressures.
764401_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Gross profit decreased 29.8% to $59.8 million, or 15.4% of net sales, in 2017 from $85.2 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016.
764401_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($16.8 million), the decrease in shipments ($6.4 million) and higher unit conversion costs ($3.4 million).
764401_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The decrease in spreads was driven by higher raw material costs ($16.2 million) and freight expense ($0.7 million) partially offset by higher average selling prices ($0.1 million).
764401_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) decreased 2.2% to $25.5 million, or 6.6% of net sales, in 2017 from $26.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2016 primarily due to lower compensation expense ($762,000) together with the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($332,000) , which was partially offset by higher bad debt ($186,000), travel ($163,000) and employee benefit expense ($160,000).
764401_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The decrease in compensation expense was largely driven by lower incentive plan expense based on our weaker results in 2017.
764401_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $812,000 in 2017 compared with $480,000 in the prior year due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in bad debt expense was due to a prior year adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our favorable collections experience.
764401_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily due to higher employee supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	A pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was incurred in 2016 related to the termination of the Delaware Plan.
764401_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net restructuring charges of $164,000 were incurred in 2017 for equipment relocation costs related to the consolidation of our PC strand facilities.
764401_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net restructuring charges of $115,000 were incurred in 2016 , which included equipment relocation costs ($186,000), facility closure costs ($89,000) and impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($20,000) partially offset by a gain on the sale of equipment previously associated with the Newnan, Georgia PC strand facility ($180,000).
764401_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2017 increased slightly to 34.0% from 33.8% in 2016 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net earnings decreased to $22.5 million ($1.17 per diluted share) in 2017 from $37.2 million ($1.95 per diluted share) in 2016 primarily due to the decrease in gross profit partially offset by lower SG A expense and the pension plan settlement loss incurred in 2016.
764401_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net sales decreased 6.5% to $418.5 million in 2016 from $447.5 million in 2015 as a 2.6% increase in shipments was offset by a n 8.8% reduction in average selling prices.
764401_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Shipments for the prior year benefited from an extra week based on our fiscal calendar.
764401_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	On a pro forma basis adjusting both years to reflect the same 52-week period as 2016, the year-over-year shipment increase was 4.8%.
764401_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions and increased demand for our products relative to the prior year.
764401_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	The decrease in average selling prices was driven by competitive pricing pressures.
764401_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross profit increased 46.0% to $85.2 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016 from $58.3 million, or 13.0% of net sales, in 2015.
764401_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($22.3 million), lower unit conversion costs ($2.3 million) and the increase in shipments ($1.6 million).
764401_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in spreads was driven by lower raw material costs ($62.4 million) and freight expense ($0.5 million) partially offset by lower average selling prices ($40.6 million).
764401_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	SG A expense increased 0.9% to $26.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2016 from $25.8 million, or 5.8% of net sales, in 2015 primarily due to higher compensation expense ($1.8 million), which was partially offset by lower employee benefit ($657,000), bad debt ($250,000) and legal expense ($114,000) together with the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($441,000).
764401_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in 2016.
764401_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The decrease in employee benefit costs was primarily related to a reduction in high-dollar health insurance claims.
764401_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The decrease in bad debt expense was due to an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our favorable collections experience.
764401_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $480,000 in 2016 compared with $39,000 in 2015 due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	A pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was incurred in 2016 related to the termination of the Delaware Plan.
764401_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Net restructuring charges of $115,000 were incurred in 2016 related to the consolidation of our PC strand facilities, including equipment relocation costs ($186,000), facility closure costs ($89,000) and impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($20,000) partially offset by a gain on the sale of equipment previously associated with the Newnan, Georgia PC strand facility ($180,000).
764401_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Net restructuring charges of $349,000 were incurred in 2015 related to the closure of the Newnan facility, which included facility closure costs ($547,000), impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($543,000), equipment relocation costs ($79,000) and employee separation costs ($75,000).
764401_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	These charges were partially offset by an $895,000 gain on the sale of the real estate and certain of the equipment associated with the Newnan facility.
764401_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other expense for 2016 was $0.2 million compared with other income of $1.1 million in 2015.
764401_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The other income for 2015 was primarily related to a $1.7 million net gain from insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment damaged in the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand facility in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million charge related to the settlement of a customer dispute.
764401_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest expense decreased 50.6% to $158,000 in 2016 from $320,000 in 2015 primarily due to borrowings on our revolving credit facility during the prior year.
764401_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2016 decreased slightly to 33.8% from 34.1% in 2015 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net earnings increased to $37.2 million ($1.9 5 per diluted share) in 2016 from $21.7 million ($1.15 per diluted share) in 2015 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense and the pension plan settlement loss.
764401_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Operating activities provided $20.3 million of cash in 2017 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by an increase in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Net working capital used $15.5 million of cash due to an $11.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $10.7 million increase in inventories partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in accounts receivable.
764401_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to lower raw material purchases near the end of the period along with a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	The increase in inventories was due to higher raw material costs and, to a lesser extent, quantities on-hand.
764401_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower sales during the period.
764401_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Operating activities provided $54.5 million of cash in 2016 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Net working capital provided $3.2 million of cash due to a $9.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in inventories and a $0.6 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventories were largely related to higher raw material purchases near the end of the period.
764401_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding partially offset by lower selling prices.
764401_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Operating activities provided $35.8 million of cash in 2015 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net working capital provided $2.3 million of cash due to a $15.9 million decrease in inventories and a $4.3 million decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a $17.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The decrease in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to lower raw material purchases and unit costs.
764401_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	The decrease in accounts receivable was related to lower selling prices.
764401_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	We may elect to adjust our operating activities as there are changes in the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Investing activities used $20.9 million of cash in 2017 primarily due to $20.6 million of capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of the Houston, Texas PC strand facility and the addition of a new ESM production line at the St. Joseph, Missouri facility.
764401_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Investing activities used $13.0 million of cash in 2016 primarily due to capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of the Houston facility.
764401_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Investing activities used $3.0 million of cash in 2015 primarily related to $7.2 million of capital expenditures and the $1.5 million acquisition of an intangible asset from a competitor, which was partially offset by $3.5 million of proceeds from the sale of the real estate and certain of the equipment associated with the Newnan, Georgia PC Strand facility, $1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to the insurance claim for the fire at our Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand facility in 2014 and $0.5 million of post-closing adjustments associated with the ASW Acquisition.
764401_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Financing activities used $26.2 million of cash in 2017, $15.9 million in 2016 and $2.5 million in 2015.
764401_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	In 2017, $26.0 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $23.7 million, or $1.25 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million).
764401_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	In 2016, $20.9 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $18.6 million, or $1.00 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million), which was partially offset by $5.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	In 2015, $2.2 million of cash was used for dividend payments and $0.2 million for financing costs that were incurred in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit facility.
764401_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend its maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	As of September 30, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $85.4 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	As of October 1, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities and the borrowing availability provided under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility as required.
764401_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we require d additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	During 2017, we were unable to fully recover the escalation in our raw material costs through price increases due to the weakening in demand and competitive pricing pressures.
764401_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	During the second half of 2016, our raw material costs rose over most of the period due to increasing scrap costs for wire rod producers which we were generally able to recover through price increases.
764401_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	During 2015 and through the first half of 2016, wire rod prices declined through most of the period due to reductions in scrap costs which favorably impacted our margins after the higher cost inventory we had purchased in earlier periods was consumed.
764401_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at September 30, 2017 are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	As we look ahead to 201 8, we expect improved conditions in our construction end-markets.
764401_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Customer sentiment remains positive and we expect the infrastructure-related portion of our business will be favorably impacted by higher state and local funding in many of our markets.
764401_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	We also expect to benefit from modest increases in nonresidential construction together with the continued recovery of the housing market.
764401_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	We believe the recent compression in spreads that we have experienced will diminish as these factors begin to drive increased demand for our products.
764401_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	We expect that our financial results will be favorably impacted by the realization of additional operating synergies associated with the ASW Acquisition and the related reconfiguration of our PC strand operations as we ramp up the new raw material cleaning and production lines at our Houston plant.
764401_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	As market conditions improve, we also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth.
764401_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	In addition, we will continue to pursue further acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The statements contained in this section are forward-looking statements.
764401_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors .
764401_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	W e are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs and other trade actions.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, in weaker market environments, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2017 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of wire rod would have resulted in a $21.7 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we did not have any balances outstanding on our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2017, future borrowings under the facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2017.
764401_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2017, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Selected quarterly financial data for 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

764401_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America.
764401_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have evaluated all subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and concluded there were no events or transactions during this period that required additional recognition or disclosure in our financial statements.
764401_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to September 30.
764401_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were 52-week periods and fiscal year 2015 was a 53-week period.
764401_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	All references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.
764401_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insteel and our subsidiaries.
764401_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
764401_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. and such accounting principles, GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
764401_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	There is no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates.
764401_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
764401_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Concentration of c redit r isk .
764401_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities.
764401_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and are generally not secured by collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	We write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
764401_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Stock- b ased c ompensation .
764401_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	We include all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to us for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost).
764401_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The valuation of inventory includes the costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
764401_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired through acquisitions, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; and land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $10.5 million in 2017, $10.4 million in 2016 and $10.9 million in 2015 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	No interest costs were capitalized in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S4	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S5	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S6	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_17_ITEM8_P28_S7	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity.
764401_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods.
764401_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Based on the results of our impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for 2017 .
764401_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	Subsequent to the analysis, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of goodwill.
764401_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Other assets consist principally of capitalized financing costs and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.
764401_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
764401_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how and non-competition agreements that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their finite useful lives (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	When we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we measure recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	There were no impairment losses in 2017.
764401_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	During 2016 and 2015, we recorded $20,000 and $0.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges related to long-lived assets resulting from the consolidation of our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Fair value of financial instruments .
764401_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income.
764401_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	We assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2017-09 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.
764401_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	ASU No. 2017-09 was issued to clarify and reduce both (i) diversity in practice and (ii) cost and complexity when applying its guidance to changes in the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award.
764401_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	ASU No. 2017-09 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

764401_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
764401_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	ASU No. 2015-11 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
764401_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
764401_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	While we have not yet identified any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition, our evaluation is ongoing and not complete.
764401_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	In 2014 we purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation ( ASW Acquisition ).
764401_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	Subsequent to the ASW Acquisition, in 2014, we incurred employee separation costs for staffing reductions associated with the acquisition.
764401_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	In February 2015, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility that had been acquired through the ASW Acquisition, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015:
764401_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	As of October 1, 2016, we recorded restructuring liabilities amounting to $0.3 million on our consolidated balance sheet, including $0.1 million in accounts payable and $0.2 million in accrued expenses.
764401_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	We do not currently expect to incur any additional restructuring charges during 2018 related to the consolidation of our PC strand operations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016, we held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are summarized below:
764401_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The carrying amount of our cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value we would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016, we had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
764401_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The primary components of our intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Amortization expense for intangibles was $1.2 million in 2017 and 2016 and $1.1 million in 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Amortization expense for the next five years, assuming no change in the estimated useful lives of identified intangible assets, is $918,000 in 2018, $705,000 in 2019, $537,000 in 2020 and $414,000 in 2021 and 2022.
764401_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend its maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	As of September 30, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $85.4 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million.
764401_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	As of October 1, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at our election, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.25% to 0.75% for index rate loans and 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans.
764401_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	Based on our excess availability as of September 30, 2017, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.25% for index rate loans and 1.25% for LIBOR loans.
764401_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Our ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if we are unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $12.5 million.
764401_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; or permit liens to encumber our property and assets.
764401_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by us or any of our subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain entries of judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control.
764401_17_ITEM8_P62_S4	As of September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the Credit Facility was $65,000 in 2017 and 2016 and $89,000 in 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.6 million as of September 30, 2017 and $4.5 million as of October 1, 2016.
764401_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	We expect the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Under our equity incentive plan, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	Effective February 17, 2015, our shareholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the 2015 Plan ), which authorizes up to 900,000 shares of our common stock for future grants under the plan.
764401_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	The 2015 Plan, which expires on February 17, 2025, replaces the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc., which expired on February 15, 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	As of September 30, 2017, there were 433,000 shares of our common stock available for future grants under the 2015 Plan, which is our only active equity incentive plan.
764401_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Under our equity incentive plan, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Options granted under the plan generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	Compensation expense associated with stock options is as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options at September 30, 2017 was $330,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.49 years.
764401_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
764401_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $11.08, $9.92 and $7.10 per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
764401_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience.
764401_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term.
764401_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
764401_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on our stock.
764401_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	The dividend yield was calculated based on our annual dividend as of the option grant date.
764401_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity:
764401_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Stock option exercises include net exercises for which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
764401_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) granted under our equity incentive plan are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense.
764401_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	The vesting period for RSUs is generally one year from the date of grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to employees.
764401_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	RSUs do not have voting rights.
764401_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	RSU grants and compensation expense are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs on September 30, 2017 was $548,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.69 years.
764401_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	The following table summarizes RSU activity:
764401_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	The reconciliation between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes is as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	As of September 30, 2017, we recorded a non-current deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $8.1 million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	As of October 1, 2016, we recorded a non-current deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $5.5 million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	We have $7.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) that begin to expire in 2018, but principally expire between 2018 and 2031.
764401_17_ITEM8_P78_S3	We have also recorded deferred tax assets for various state tax credits of $46,000, which will begin to expire in 2019 and principally expire between 2019 and 2020.
764401_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	The realization of our deferred tax assets is entirely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions.
764401_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	GAAP requires that we periodically assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully utilized.
764401_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	As of September 30, 2017, we had recorded a valuation allowance of $251,000 pertaining to various state NOLs and tax credits that were not expected to be utilized.
764401_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	The valuation allowance is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on changes in facts and circumstances and would be reduced should we utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards against which an allowance had previously been provided or determine that such utilization is more likely than not.
764401_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	The $29,000 decrease in the valuation allowance during 2017 is primarily due to the reduction in enacted state tax rates and the expiration of state NOLs for which an allowance had been previously recorded.
764401_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of September 30, 2017, we had no material, known tax exposures that required the establishment of contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions.
764401_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.
764401_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	There were no interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015.
764401_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	We file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as state and local income tax returns in various jurisdictions.
764401_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	Federal and various state tax returns filed subsequent to 2012 remain subject to examination.
764401_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	We had one defined benefit pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Delaware Plan provided benefits for eligible employees based primarily upon years of service and compensation levels.
764401_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Delaware Plan was frozen effective September 30, 2008 whereby participants no longer earned additional benefits.
764401_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	During 2016, we terminated the Delaware Plan and settled plan liabilities through either lump sum distributions to plan participants or annuity contracts purchased from a third-party insurance company that provided for the payment of vested benefits to those participants that did not elect the lump sum option.
764401_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	As of October 1, 2016, there were no remaining plan assets.
764401_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	We made contributions totaling $1.9 million and $234,000 to the Delaware Plan during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
764401_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	As a result of the pension termination, unrecognized losses, which previously were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets, were recognized as expense and the pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was recorded on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended October 1, 2016.
764401_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	T he reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for the Delaware Plan is as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the Delaware Plan includes the following components:
764401_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the Delaware Plan are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In establishing the discount rate, we reviewed published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the Delaware Plan.
764401_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and future expectations of returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the Delaware Plan portfolio.
764401_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Prior to the termination and settlement of the Delaware Plan the fundamental goal underlying the investment policy was to ensure that its assets were invested in a prudent manner to meet its obligations as such obligations became due.
764401_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The primary investment objectives included providing a total return that would promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, diversifying investments across and within asset classes, minimizing the impact of losses in single investments and adhering to investment practices that complied with applicable laws and regulations.
764401_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The investment strategy for equities emphasized U.S. large cap equities with the portfolio s performance measured against the S P 500 index or other applicable indices.
764401_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The investment strategy for fixed income investments was focused on maintaining an overall portfolio with a minimum credit rating of A-1 as well as a minimum rating of any security at the time of purchase of Baa/BBB by Moody s or Standard Poor s, if rated.
764401_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Delaware Plan had a long-term target asset mix of 60% equities and 40% fixed income.
764401_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	The asset allocations for the Delaware Plan as of October 3, 2015 were as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	We have Retirement Security Agreements (each, a SERP ) with certain of our employees (each, a Participant ).
764401_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	Under the SERPs, if the Participant remains in continuous service with us for a period of at least 30 years, we will pay them a supplemental retirement benefit for the 15-year period following their retirement equal to 50% of their highest average annual base salary for five consecutive years in the 10-year period preceding their retirement.
764401_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	If the Participant retires prior to the later of age 65 or the completion of 30 years of continuous service with us, but has completed at least 10 years of continuous service, the amount of their supplemental retirement benefit will be reduced by 1/360th for each month short of 30 years that they were employed by us.
764401_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	In 2005, we revised the SERPs to add Participants and increase benefits to certain existing Participants.
764401_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized for the SERPs in our consolidated balance sheets is as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the SERPs includes the following components:
764401_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2018 is $150,000.
764401_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the SERPs are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the plan.
764401_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	The SERPs expected rate of increase in compensation levels is based on the anticipated increases in annual compensation.
764401_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	The projected benefit payments under the SERPs are as follows:
764401_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	As noted above, the SERPs were revised in 2005 to add Participants and increase benefits to certain existing Participants.
764401_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	However, for certain Participants we still maintain the benefits of the respective SERPs that were in effect prior to the 2005 changes, which entitle them to fixed cash benefits upon retirement at age 65, payable annually for 15 years.
764401_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	These SERPs are supported by life insurance policies on the Participants that are purchased and owned by us.
764401_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	The cash benefits paid under these SERPs were $40,000 in 2017 and 25,000 in 2016 and 2015.

764401_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	As allowed under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees.
764401_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Plan allows for discretionary contributions to be made by us as determined by the Board of Directors, which are allocated among eligible participants based on their compensation relative to the total compensation of all participants .

764401_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	During 2015 to 2017, we matched employee contributions up to 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of eligible compensation that was contributed by employees.

764401_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	In response, we reassigned a portion of our strand production requirements to our facility located in Sanderson, Florida, which was operating at a reduced utilization level.
764401_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the remainder of the repairs and the Gallatin facility was fully operational.
764401_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	We maintained general liability, business interruption and replacement cost property insurance coverage on our facilities that was sufficient to cover the losses incurred from the fire.

764401_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

764401_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance that a misstatement of financial statements would be prevented or detected.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

764401_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
764401_17_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, and our report dated October 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

764401_17_ITEM14_P37_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the Company ) for the period ended September 30, 2017 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, Michael C.

764401_17_ITEM14_P38_S0	(2) the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
764401_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Insteel Industries, Inc. ( we, us, our, the Company or Insteel ) is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand ( PC strand ) and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement ( CPR ) and standard welded wire reinforcement ( SWWR ).
764401_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction.
764401_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	For fiscal 2018, we estimate that approximately 85% of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 15% were related to residential construction.
764401_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina.
764401_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer in our industry; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate ten manufacturing facilities that are all located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers and raw material suppliers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our growth strategy is focused on organic opportunities as well as acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
764401_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our concrete reinforcing products consist of two product lines: PC strand and WWR.
764401_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Based on the criteria specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have one reportable segment.
764401_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	PC strand is a high strength, seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures.
764401_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Its high tensile strength allows for the casting of longer spans and thinner sections.
764401_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, PC strand sales represented 40%, 38% and 39%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction.
764401_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR.
764401_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a lower cost reinforcing solution than hot-rolled rebar.
764401_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, WWR sales represented 60%, 62% and 61%, respectively, of our net sales.
764401_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees.
764401_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our outside sales representatives are trained on the technical applications for our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories.
764401_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering them primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	The delivery method selected is dependent upon backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements.
764401_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	In fiscal 2018, we estimate that approximately 70% of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as most of our customers sell products that are used for both nonresidential and residential construction, and the same products can be used for different end uses.
764401_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	We did not have any customers that represented 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	The loss of a single customer or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
764401_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Backlog for our business is minimal due to the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We believe that the majority of our firm orders as of the end of fiscal 2018 will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	From a seasonal standpoint, shipments typically reach their highest level of the year when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity.
764401_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result, assuming normal seasonal weather patterns, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters.
764401_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	From a cyclical standpoint, construction activity and demand for our products is generally correlated with overall economic conditions, although there can be significant differences between the relative strength of nonresidential and residential construction for extended periods.
764401_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers and can generally be characterized as a commodity product.
764401_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our products.
764401_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR.
764401_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Wire rod prices tend to fluctuate based on changes in scrap and other metallic prices for steel producers together with domestic and global market conditions.
764401_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market.
764401_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	Trade actions initiated by the U.S. government or domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 represented approximately 14% and 27%, respectively, of our total wire rod purchases.
764401_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	We believe that our substantial wire rod requirements, desirable mix of sizes and grades, and strong financial condition represent a competitive advantage by making us a relatively more attractive customer to our suppliers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels.
764401_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	These laws generally prescribe a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance.
764401_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	Certain segments of the PC strand market and the majority of our CPR and ESM products are certified to customers to be in compliance with the domestic content regulations.
764401_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices.
764401_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors.
764401_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Ultimately the relative supply - demand balance in our markets and competitive dynamics determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	We are the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our markets are highly competitive based on price, quality and service.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc. ( Keystone ), Oklahoma Steel and Wire, and Gerdau Long Products North America, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	Our primary competitors for WWR products are Engineered Wire Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Keystone), Wire Mesh Corporation, Concrete Reinforcements, Inc., National Wire Products, Davis Wire Corporation and Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S5	Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation, Keystone and Wire Mesh Corporation.
764401_18_ITEM1_P22_S6	Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand market, and, to a lesser extent, the SWWR market that are not subject to Buy America requirements.
764401_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	In 2003, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC ) alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market.
764401_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	In 2010, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry.
764401_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.
764401_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers.
764401_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities.
764401_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and national footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low-cost production capabilities, sophisticated information systems and financial strength and flexibility, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products.
764401_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	As of September 29, 2018, we had 810 employees, none of which were represented by labor unions.
764401_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	In the event of production disruptions, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and financial results.
764401_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our products are used in applications that are subject to inherent risks, including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production.
764401_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	We warrant our products to meet certain specifications.
764401_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	Although actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial.
764401_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks.
764401_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
764401_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations.
764401_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
764401_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal 2019.
764401_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports, are available at no cost on our web site at https://insteelgcs.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings and the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports electronically with, or furnish them to, the SEC.
764401_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	The information available on our web site and the SEC s web site is not incorporated into this report or any of our filings with the SEC.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and c an be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the overall economy as well as other factors beyond our control.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole and increasing the risk of payment defaults on our accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products .
764401_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow s .
764401_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Demand for our products is highly variable.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory rebalancing measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2018.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, trade actions by the U.S. government, such as the imposition of the steel tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended, or domestic wire rod producers against other countries can significantly impact the availability and cost of imported wire rod.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The imposition of tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. government against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their competitiveness and participation in the domestic market, which is of increasing importance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our PC strand business, and, to a lesser extent, our SWWR business are subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand and SWWR producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to u nexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses .
764401_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, during fiscal 2017, operations at our Texas and Florida plants were temporarily curtailed due to flooding and power outages related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and during fiscal 2018, a transformer outage and electrical fire at our Dayton, Texas plant resulted in a temporary interruption of operations.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Consistent with the experience of other employers, our medical and workers compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and increase our employee health care costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This legislation requires certain large employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Administration and Congress are pursuing legislative and regulatory changes that modify, repeal, replace with new legislation or otherwise invalidate all or certain portions of the ACA.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminated certain provisions of the ACA, including the individual mandate beginning in 2019.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	It is uncertain whether the other reform proposals being considered by the Administration and Congress will be enacted and potentially alter the full-time employee healthcare coverage requirement and reporting obligations imposed on large employers like us.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In addition, increasing prices for freight, natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	For most of our business, we incur the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products to our customers.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill .
764401_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our growth, operations, financial condition and results of operations.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	During fiscal 2018, our common stock traded as high as $43.78 and as low as $24.51.
764401_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results.
764401_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
764401_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	At September 29, 2018, we operated ten manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri.
764401_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own all of our real estate following the exercise of the purchase option on the previously leased Houston facility in October 2017.
764401_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained.
764401_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected demand for our products.
764401_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM4_P0_S0	Our executive officers are as follows:

764401_18_ITEM4_P4_S1	In February 2007, Mr. Wagner was appointed Vice President of the parent company, Insteel Industries, Inc.
764401_18_ITEM4_P5_S0	From 1977 until 1992, Mr. Wagner served in various positions with Florida Wire and Cable, Inc., a manufacturer of PC strand and galvanized strand products, which was later acquired by us in 2000.
764401_18_ITEM4_P6_S0	The executive officers listed above were elected by our Board of Directors at its annual meeting held February 13, 2018 for a term that will expire at the next annual meeting or until their successors are elected and qualify.
764401_18_ITEM4_P6_S1	The next meeting at which officers will be elected is expected to be February 12, 2019.
764401_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol IIIN and has been trading on Nasdaq since September 28, 2004.
764401_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of October 23, 2018, there were 550 shareholders of record.
764401_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table summarizes the high and low sales prices as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2018 and 2017:
764401_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	In addition to our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, we declared special cash dividends of $1.00 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and $1.25 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
764401_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and our financial condition, operating results, cash requirements and expansion plans.
764401_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion with respect to restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
764401_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index for the five years ended September 29, 2018.
764401_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	The graph and table assume that $100 was invested on September 28, 2013 in our common stock and in each of the two indices and the reinvestment of all dividends.
764401_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S P Building Products Index are based on our fiscal year.
764401_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Information regarding our share repurchase authorization is discussed in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Information regarding our Rights Agreement is discussed in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	Our August 15, 2014 acquisition of substantially all the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation (the ASW Acquisition ) may materially affect the comparability of the information reflected in the selected financial data presented in this Item 6.
764401_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks.
764401_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
764401_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry.
764401_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer in our industry; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
764401_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following critical accounting policies are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments, assumptions and estimates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded for accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
764401_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and are generally not secured by collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us.
764401_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances.
764401_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	These judgments and estimates consider such factors as the financial position, cash flows and payment history of our customers as well as current and expected business conditions.
764401_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	It is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates, which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances.
764401_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	Adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	This evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances for losses in the normal course of operations, providing for excess and obsolete inventory, and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory, future demand, our historical experience and market conditions.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	In assessing the realization of inventory values, we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	Adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We review long-lived assets, which consist principally of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured based on the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has been incurred, the impairment loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling cost when we have committed to a disposal plan, and are reported separately as assets held for sale on our balance sheet.
764401_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge.
764401_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We monitor our operating results throughout the year to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant any interim impairment testing.
764401_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Otherwise, goodwill will be subject to the required annual impairment test during our fourth quarter.
764401_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including the expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could reduce our estimated fair value in the future and result in an impairment of goodwill.
764401_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	There was no goodwill impairment loss recognized in fiscal 2018.
764401_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims.
764401_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience.
764401_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	These estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates, litigation trends, changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns.
764401_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances, future adjustments to these reserves may be required.
764401_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We are involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
764401_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The eventual outcome of such matters and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
764401_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
764401_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	We estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel, the outcome of similar litigation, the status of the lawsuits and other factors.
764401_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions, it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	We monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments.
764401_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	We account for stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock option grants and restricted stock units, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
764401_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Under these provisions, compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
764401_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We use the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, which requires us to make assumptions for the expected term, volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and forfeiture rates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	These assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends.
764401_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	If actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors, future adjustments to these estimates may be required.
764401_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Assumptions for employee benefit plan .
764401_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for our supplemental employee retirement plans (each, a SERP ) in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.
764401_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Under the provisions of ASC Topic 715, we recognize net periodic pension cost and value liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions, principally the assumed discount rate.
764401_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The discount rate we utilize for determining net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligation for the SERPs is based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies.
764401_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds.
764401_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	The discount rate is used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year.
764401_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	The discount rate for the SERPs was 4.00% for fiscal 2018 and 3.75% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The assumed discount rate is reevaluated annually.
764401_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Changes in this assumption can result in the recognition of a materially different pension cost over different periods and a materially different liability amount in our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase.
764401_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain.
764401_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains.
764401_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SERPs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels.
764401_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates.
764401_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	We currently expect net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2019 to be $821,000 for the SERPs.
764401_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Cash contributions to the SERPs during fiscal 2019 are expected to be $325,000.
764401_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SERPs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of September 29, 2018 by approximately $281,000 and $228,000, respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2019 by approximately $33,000.
764401_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for the related accounting and disclosures surrounding our terminated pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference.
764401_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net sales increased 16.5% to $453.2 million in 2018 from $388.9 million in 2017, reflecting a 4.6% increase in shipments and an 11.5% increase in average selling prices.
764401_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions and strengthening demand for our products relative to the prior year.
764401_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented in the current year to recover the escalation in raw material costs.
764401_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross profit increased 18.4% to $70.8 million, or 15.6% of net sales, in 2018 from $59.8 million, or 15.4% of net sales, in 2017 primarily due to higher spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($6.2 million), higher shipments ($2.8 million) and lower manufacturing costs ($1.1 million).
764401_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The increase in spreads was driven by higher average selling prices ($46.2 million) partially offset by higher raw material costs ($38.7 million) and freight expense ($1.3 million).
764401_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) increased 11.0% to $28.3 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2018 from $25.5 million, or 6.6% of net sales, in 2017 primarily due to higher compensation ($1.7 million) and employee benefit costs ($566,000) partially offset by a smaller increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($259,000).
764401_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by additional staffing to support the growth of our ESM product line and higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results.
764401_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily related to higher employee health insurance costs.
764401_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $553,000 in 2018 compared with $812,000 in the prior year due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net restructuring charges of $164,000 were incurred in 2017 for equipment relocation costs related to the consolidation of our PC strand facilities.
764401_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Other expense for 2018 was $274,000 compared with $53,000 in 2017 primarily due to losses on the disposition of property, plant and equipment.
764401_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2018 decreased to 14.9% from 34.0% in 2017.
764401_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The effective rate for 2018 reflects a $3.3 million gain on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.
764401_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	Excluding the deferred tax gain, our effective rate decreased to 22.7% from 34.0% in the prior year period reflecting the reduction in the federal statutory rate to 21% from 35% for three quarters of fiscal 2018.
764401_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net earnings increased to $36.3 million ($1.88 per diluted share) in 2018 from $22.5 million ($1.17 per diluted share) in 2017 primarily due to the increase in gross profit together with the deferred tax gain and reduction in our effective tax rate related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by higher SG A expense.
764401_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net sales decreased 7.1% to $388.9 million in 2017 from $418.5 million in 2016 due to lower shipments as average selling prices were essentially unchanged.
764401_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Shipments in 2017 were unfavorably impacted by adverse weather conditions during the second half of the year including the effect from hurricanes Harvey and Irma on our Texas and Florida facilities together with a reduction in new project activity and competitive pricing pressures.
764401_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Gross profit decreased 29.8% to $59.8 million, or 15.4% of net sales, in 2017 from $85.2 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs ($16.8 million), the decrease in shipments ($6.4 million) and higher manufacturing costs ($3.4 million).
764401_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The decrease in spreads was driven by higher raw material costs ($16.2 million) and freight expense ($0.7 million) partially offset by higher average selling prices ($0.1 million).
764401_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	SG A expense decreased 2.2% to $25.5 million, or 6.6% of net sales, in 2017 from $26.1 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in 2016 primarily due to lower compensation expense ($762,000) together with the relative year-over-year change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies ($332,000), which was partially offset by higher bad debt ($186,000), travel ($163,000) and employee benefit expense ($160,000).
764401_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease in compensation expense was largely driven by lower incentive plan expense based on our weaker results in 2017.
764401_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $812,000 in 2017 compared with $480,000 in 2016 due to the changes in the value of the underlying investments.
764401_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	The increase in bad debt expense was due to an adjustment in 2016 that reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our favorable collections experience.
764401_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase in employee benefit costs was primarily due to higher employee supplemental retirement plan expense.
764401_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	A pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was incurred in 2016 related to the termination of the Delaware Plan.
764401_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Net restructuring charges of $164,000 were incurred in 2017 for equipment relocation costs related to the consolidation of our PC strand facilities.
764401_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Net restructuring charges of $115,000 were incurred in 2016, which included equipment relocation costs ($186,000), facility closure costs ($89,000) and impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment ($20,000) partially offset by a gain on the sale of equipment previously associated with the Newnan, Georgia PC strand facility ($180,000).
764401_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our effective income tax rate for 2017 increased slightly to 34.0% from 33.8% in 2016 due to changes in permanent book versus tax differences.
764401_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net earnings decreased to $22.5 million ($1.17 per diluted share) in 2017 from $37.2 million ($1.95 per diluted share) in 2016 primarily due to the decrease in gross profit partially offset by lower SG A expense and the pension plan settlement loss incurred in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating activities provided $54.0 million of cash in 2018 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Net working capital provided $4.7 million of cash due to a $28.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in inventories and an $11.2 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to higher raw material purchases near the end of the period and, to a lesser extent, increases in accrued salaries, wages and related expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increases in inventories and accounts receivable were due to the escalation in raw material costs and average selling prices during 2018.
764401_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Operating activities provided $20.8 million of cash in 2017 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by an increase in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Net working capital used $15.5 million of cash due to an $11.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $10.7 million increase in inventories partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to lower raw material purchases near the end of the period along with a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	The increase in inventories was due to higher raw material costs and, to a lesser extent, quantities on-hand.
764401_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the lower sales in 2017.
764401_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Operating activities provided $56.3 million of cash in 2016 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and a reduction in the net working capital components of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Net working capital provided $3.2 million of cash due to a $9.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in inventories and a $0.6 million increase in accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventories were largely related to higher raw material purchases near the end of 2016.
764401_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding partially offset by lower average selling prices.
764401_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We may elect to adjust our operating activities as there are changes in the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Investing activities used $21.9 million of cash in 2018 primarily due to $18.4 million of capital expenditures and $3.3 million for the acquisition of a business.
764401_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	The capital expenditures were largely related to additional investments in ESM manufacturing capabilities, the purchase of the leased Houston facility and further upgrades of production technology and information systems.
764401_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Investing activities used $20.9 million of cash in 2017 primarily due to $20.6 million of capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of the Houston, Texas PC strand facility and the addition of a new ESM production line at the St. Joseph, Missouri facility.
764401_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	Investing activities used $13.0 million of cash in 2016 primarily due to capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of the Houston facility.
764401_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken.
764401_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Financing activities used $20.1 million of cash in 2018, $26.7 million in 2017 and $17.7 million in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2018, $21.3 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $19.0 million, or $1.00 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million), which was partially offset by $2.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	In 2017, $26.0 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $23.7 million, or $1.25 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million).
764401_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	In 2016, $20.9 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of $18.6 million, or $1.00 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling $2.3 million), which was partially offset by $5.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
764401_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk.
764401_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	In May 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other changes, extend its maturity date from June 2, 2016 to May 13, 2020.
764401_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	As of September 29, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $98.2 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	As of September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities and the borrowing availability provided under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any.
764401_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility as required.
764401_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Should we determine, at any time, that we require additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding.
764401_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
764401_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.
764401_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes.
764401_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives.
764401_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.
764401_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	During 2018, we were successful in implementing price increases sufficient to recover the escalation in our raw material costs that occurred over the course of the year.
764401_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	In 2017, we were unable to fully recover the increase in our raw material costs due to the weakening in demand and competitive pricing pressures.
764401_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	During 2016, our raw material costs rose over most of the period, which we were generally able to recover through price increases.
764401_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	The timing and magnitude of any future increases in raw material costs and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time.
764401_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses.
764401_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our contractual obligations and commitments at September 29, 2018 are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	(1) Non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw materials.
764401_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	(2) Contractual commitments for capital expenditures.
764401_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Looking ahead to 2019, we expect our financial results will be favorably impacted by continued growth in our construction end-markets.
764401_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The infrastructure-related portion of our business should benefit from increased federal funding through the FAST Act and supplementary measures together with higher state and local spending in many of our markets supported by various initiatives such as fuel tax increases, bond issuances and other ballot measures.
764401_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The leading indicators and industry forecasts for nonresidential construction remain positive, and the housing recovery is expected to continue driven by favorable employment and demographic trends.
764401_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Business conditions are likely to remain challenging, however, in view of the escalation in our raw material costs resulting from the Administration s Section 232 imported steel tariff program.
764401_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Considering that the tariffs do not apply to imports of downstream products such as welded wire reinforcement and PC strand, we expect a surge in low-priced import competition that results in market share erosion and margin compression for domestic producers.
764401_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	We are engaged with the Administration and Congress to arrive at a solution that addresses the unsustainable competitive environment resulting from the tariff program.
764401_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	We will continue to maintain our focus on the operational fundamentals of our business: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.
764401_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	We also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth.
764401_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, we will continue to pursue further acquisitions in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our footprint.
764401_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The statements contained in this section are forward-looking statements.
764401_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors .
764401_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, quotas and other trade actions.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, in weaker market environments, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our 2018 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10% increase in the price of wire rod would have resulted in a $26.6 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices).
764401_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we did not have any balances outstanding on our Credit Facility as of September 29, 2018, future borrowings under the facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	There were no forward contracts outstanding as of September 29, 2018.
764401_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	During 2018, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Selected quarterly financial data for 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

764401_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Insteel Industries, Inc. ( we, us, our, Insteel or the Company ) is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
764401_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company ( IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary.
764401_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand ( PC strand ) and welded wire reinforcement ( WWR ), including engineered structural mesh, concrete pipe reinforcement and standard welded wire reinforcement.
764401_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Our products are primarily sold to manufacturers of concrete products and, to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors.
764401_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America.
764401_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have evaluated all subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and concluded there were no events or transactions during this period that required additional recognition or disclosure in our financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to September 30.
764401_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 52-week periods.
764401_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	All references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.
764401_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insteel and our subsidiaries.
764401_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
764401_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. and such accounting principles, GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
764401_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	There is no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates.
764401_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
764401_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Concentration of c redit r isk .
764401_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
764401_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits.
764401_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
764401_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities.
764401_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the U.S. and are generally not secured by collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account.
764401_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
764401_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	We write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
764401_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk.
764401_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
764401_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	We account for forfeitures as they occur.
764401_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a Monte Carlo valuation model at the grant date, which considers a range of assumptions including the expected term, volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.
764401_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	We recognize revenue from product sales when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer.
764401_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and recorded on a net basis.
764401_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	We include all of the outbound freight, shipping and handling costs associated with the shipment of products to customers in cost of sales.
764401_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Any amounts paid by customers to us for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates computation on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value.
764401_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The valuation of inventory includes the costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
764401_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or fair market value in the case of the assets acquired through acquisitions, or otherwise at reduced values to the extent there have been asset impairment write-downs.
764401_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred, while major improvements are capitalized.
764401_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes principally by use of the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 - 15 years; buildings, 10 - 30 years; and land improvements, 5 - 15 years.
764401_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	Depreciation expense was approximately $11.6 million in 2018, $10.5 million in 2017 and $10.4 million in 2016 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A expense ) in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 5 years and reflected in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	No interest costs were capitalized in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value, including goodwill.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S4	We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S5	It may be necessary to perform a quantitative analysis where a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S6	Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date; (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (c) a discount rate based on our estimated after-tax weighted average cost of capital; and (d) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to alternative scenarios based on their likelihood of occurrence.
764401_18_ITEM8_P27_S7	In developing these assumptions, we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated.
764401_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity.
764401_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods.
764401_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	Based on the results of our impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment losses were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for 2018.
764401_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	Subsequent to the analysis, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of goodwill.
764401_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Other assets consist principally of capitalized financing costs related to our revolving credit facility and the cash surrender value of life insurance policies.
764401_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Capitalized financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related credit agreement, and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives.
764401_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
764401_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology and know-how, non-competition agreements and a trade name, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their finite useful lives (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
764401_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	When we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we measure recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset or asset group.
764401_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future net cash flows or comparable market values.
764401_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	There were no impairment losses in 2018 and 2017.
764401_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	During 2016, we recorded $20,000 of impairment charges related to long-lived assets resulting from the consolidation of our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
764401_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Fair value of financial instruments .
764401_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
764401_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Income taxes are based on pretax financial accounting income.
764401_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
764401_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	We assess the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that the tax assets will be fully realized.
764401_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
764401_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Diluted EPS are computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive equity securities outstanding during the period.
764401_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	Securities that have the effect of increasing EPS are considered to be antidilutive and are not included in the computation of diluted EPS.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2018-02 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	ASU No. 2018-02 provides for the reclassification of stranded income tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	We elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02 during our fourth fiscal quarter.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	The amount of the stranded income tax effect was determined under the specific identification approach and derived from the deferred tax balance associated with our supplemental employee retirement plan.
764401_18_ITEM8_P38_S5	The adoption of the guidance resulted in the transfer of $0.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings, with no impact to total shareholders equity or net earnings.
764401_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
764401_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	We adopted this update during our first quarter.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	ASU No. 2016-09 requires that excess income tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments be recognized within income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which they occur, rather than within additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet on a prospective basis.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	There was no material impact from this provision on income tax expense in the current year.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	The impact of this provision on our future results of operations is difficult to predict as it will depend in part on the market prices for the shares of our common stock on the dates there are taxable events related to the share-based awards.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S3	In connection with another provision within ASU No. 2016-09, we have elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards as an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest, which is consistent with our accounting policy prior to adoption.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S4	We also adopted the provisions related to changes on the consolidated statements of cash flows on a retrospective basis.
764401_18_ITEM8_P40_S5	As a result, we no longer classify excess income tax benefits as a financing activity, which increased net cash provided by operating activities and reduced net cash provided by financing activities by $0.5 million and $1.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
764401_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
764401_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
764401_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	We adopted ASU No. 2015-11 during our first quarter.
764401_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The adoption of this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.
764401_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	ASU No. 2017-09 was issued to clarify and reduce both (i) diversity in practice and (ii) cost and complexity when applying its guidance to changes in the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award.
764401_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	ASU No. 2017-09 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
764401_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
764401_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	ASU No. 2017-04 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
764401_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows Topic 230: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
764401_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	ASU No. 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing differences in the presentation of these items.
764401_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 are to be adopted retrospectively and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_18_ITEM8_P46_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases, which will replace the guidance in ASC Topic 840.
764401_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	ASU No. 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset.
764401_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	ASU No. 2016-02 will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
764401_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as subsequently amended, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
764401_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	ASU No. 2014-09 provides that an entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
764401_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
764401_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
764401_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	We have substantially completed our evaluation of the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements and plan on using the modified retrospective method upon adoption.
764401_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	We have not identified any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition that will result from the adoption of this guidance, but expect it will have a material impact on the disclosures required in our notes to the consolidated financial statements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	In 2014 we purchased substantially all of the assets associated with the PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation ( ASW Acquisition ).
764401_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Subsequent to the ASW Acquisition, in 2014, we incurred employee separation costs for staffing reductions associated with the acquisition.
764401_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	In February 2015, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Newnan, Georgia facility that had been acquired through the ASW Acquisition, which was completed in March 2015.
764401_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Following is a summary of the restructuring activities and associated costs that were incurred during 2017 and 2016:
764401_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
764401_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
764401_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
764401_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
764401_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
764401_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are summarized below:
764401_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
764401_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The carrying amount of our cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
764401_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2.
764401_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value we would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date.
764401_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had no nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
764401_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
764401_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The primary components of our intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Amortization expense for intangibles was $1.3 million in 2018 and $1.2 million in 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Amortization expense for the next five years, assuming no change in the estimated useful lives of identified intangible assets, is $1.1 million in 2019, $924,000 in 2020, $809,000 in 2021, $770,000 in 2022 and $705,000 in 2023.
764401_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	We completed the acquisition of a business during 2018, and the effects of the purchase price allocation for this transaction on the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not material.
764401_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	We have a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) maturing May 13, 2020 that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements.
764401_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently $100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories.
764401_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	As of September 29, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, $98.2 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled $1.8 million.
764401_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	As of September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.
764401_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon (1) an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, 0.50% plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or (2) at our election, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin.
764401_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of 0.25% to 0.75% for index rate loans and 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans.
764401_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by 2.00% upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	Based on our excess availability as of September 29, 2018, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were 0.25% for index rate loans and 1.25% for LIBOR loans.
764401_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Our ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if we are unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility.
764401_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve-month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than $12.5 million.
764401_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; or permit liens to encumber our property and assets.
764401_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by us or any of our subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain entries of judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control.
764401_18_ITEM8_P64_S4	As of September 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default.
764401_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the Credit Facility was $65,000 in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	Accumulated amortization of capitalized financing costs was $4.7 million as of September 29, 2018 and $4.6 million as of September 30, 2017.
764401_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	We expect the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years:
764401_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Under our equity incentive plan, employees and directors may be granted stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards.
764401_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	Effective February 17, 2015, our shareholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the 2015 Plan ), which authorizes up to 900,000 shares of our common stock for future grants under the plan.
764401_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	The 2015 Plan, which expires on February 17, 2025, replaces the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc., which expired on February 15, 2015.
764401_18_ITEM8_P66_S3	As of September 29, 2018, there were 334,000 shares of our common stock available for future grants under the 2015 Plan, which is our only active equity incentive plan.
764401_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Under our equity incentive plan, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant.
764401_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	Options granted under the plan generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
764401_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	Compensation expense associated with stock options was $906,000 in 2018, $1.0 million in 2017 and $988,000 in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P67_S3	As of September 29, 2018, there was $262,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.66 years.
764401_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
764401_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $12.06, $11.08 and $9.92 per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
764401_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience.
764401_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term.
764401_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.
764401_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on our common stock.
764401_18_ITEM8_P70_S3	The dividend yield was calculated based on our annual dividend as of the option grant date.
764401_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity:
764401_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Stock option exercises include net exercises for which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
764401_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) granted under our equity incentive plan are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense.
764401_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	The vesting period for RSUs is generally one year from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to employees.
764401_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	RSUs do not have voting rights.
764401_18_ITEM8_P73_S3	RSU grants and compensation expense are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	As of September 29, 2018, there was $451,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.74 years.
764401_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The following table summarizes RSU activity:
764401_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	The reconciliation between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes is as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) was enacted, which, among other changes, reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
764401_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Since our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 rather than the calendar year, we are subject to IRS rules relating to transitional income tax rates.
764401_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	Based on these rules, our federal statutory rate was 24.5% for fiscal 2018 and will be 21% for fiscal 2019 and beyond.
764401_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	Based on the provisions of the Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities and adjusted our estimated annual federal income tax rate to incorporate the lower corporate tax rate into our tax provision during our first fiscal quarter which resulted in a $3.3 million reduction of income tax expense.
764401_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	We are still in process of evaluating the income tax effect of the Act on the executive compensation limitations that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019.
764401_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	As of September 29, 2018, we recorded a deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $5.3 million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	As of September 30, 2017, we recorded a deferred tax liability (net of valuation allowance) of $8.1 million in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
764401_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	We have $6.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) that begin to expire in 2019, but principally expire between 2019 and 2032.
764401_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	We have also recorded deferred tax assets of $16,000 for various state tax credits that begin to expire in 2019, but principally expire between 2019 and 2020.
764401_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	The realization of our deferred tax assets is entirely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions.
764401_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	GAAP requires that we periodically assess the need to establish a reserve against our deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully realized.
764401_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	As of September 29, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $233,000 pertaining to various state NOLs and tax credits that were not expected to be utilized.
764401_18_ITEM8_P82_S3	The valuation allowance is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on changes in facts and circumstances and would be reduced should we utilize the state NOLs and tax credits against which an allowance had previously been provided or determine that such utilization was more likely than not.
764401_18_ITEM8_P82_S4	The $18,000 decrease in the valuation allowance during 2018 is primarily due to the expiration of state NOLs for which an allowance had been previously recorded.
764401_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	As of September 29, 2018, we had no material, known tax exposures that required the establishment of contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions.
764401_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.
764401_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	There were no interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits incurred during 2018, 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	We file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as state and local income tax returns in various jurisdictions.
764401_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Federal and various state tax returns filed subsequent to 2013 remain subject to examination.
764401_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	We had one defined benefit pension plan, the Insteel Wire Products Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees, Wilmington, Delaware (the Delaware Plan ).
764401_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Delaware Plan provided benefits for eligible employees based primarily upon years of service and compensation levels.
764401_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Delaware Plan was frozen effective September 30, 2008 whereby participants no longer earned additional benefits.
764401_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	During 2016, we terminated the Delaware Plan and settled plan liabilities through either lump sum distributions to plan participants or annuity contracts purchased from a third-party insurance company that provided for the payment of vested benefits to those participants that did not elect the lump sum option.
764401_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	We made contributions totaling $1.9 million to the Delaware Plan during 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	As a result of the pension termination, unrecognized losses, which previously were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets, were recognized as expense and a pension plan settlement loss of $2.5 million was recorded on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended October 1, 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	The reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for the Delaware Plan is as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Reconciliation of funded status to net amount recognized:
764401_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet:
764401_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss:
764401_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive loss:
764401_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the Delaware Plan includes the following components:
764401_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The assumed discount rate used for the valuation of the Delaware Plan was 3.75% as of October 1, 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	In establishing the discount rate, we reviewed published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the Delaware Plan.
764401_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	We have Retirement Security Agreements (each, a SERP ) with certain of our employees (each, a Participant ).
764401_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	Under the SERPs, if the Participant remains in continuous service with us for a period of at least 30 years, we will pay the Participant a supplemental retirement benefit for the 15-year period following the Participant s retirement equal to 50% of the Participant s highest average annual base salary for five consecutive years in the 10-year period preceding the Participant s retirement.
764401_18_ITEM8_P96_S2	If the Participant retires prior to the later of age 65 or the completion of 30 years of continuous service with us, but has completed at least 10 years of continuous service, the amount of the Participant s supplemental retirement benefit will be reduced by 1/360th for each month short of 30 years that the Participant was employed by us.
764401_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The reconciliation of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized for the SERPs in our consolidated balance sheets is as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	Net periodic pension cost for the SERPs includes the following components:
764401_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2019 is $140,000.
764401_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	The assumptions used in the valuation of the SERPs are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date.
764401_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the SERPs.
764401_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The SERPs expected rate of increase in compensation levels is based on the anticipated increases in annual compensation.
764401_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The projected benefit payments under the SERPs are as follows:
764401_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	In 1996, we adopted the Retirement Savings Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the Plan ) to provide retirement benefits and stock ownership for our employees.
764401_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Plan is an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
764401_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	As allowed under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees.
764401_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Plan allows for discretionary contributions to be made by us as determined by the Board of Directors, which are allocated among eligible participants based on their compensation relative to the total compensation of all participants .
764401_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	Employees are permitted to contribute up to 75% of their annual compensation to the Plan, limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code.
764401_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	We match employee contributions up to 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of eligible compensation that is contributed by employees.
764401_18_ITEM8_P107_S3	Our contributions to the Plan were $1.1 million in 2018 and 2017 and $1.0 million in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations ( VEBA ) .
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	We have a VEBA which allows both us and our employees to make contributions to pay for medical costs.
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	Our contributions to the VEBA were $5.1 million in 2018, $5.6 million in 2017 and $5.4 million in 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S3	We are primarily self-insured for our employee s healthcare costs, carrying stop-loss insurance coverage for individual claims in excess of $175,000 per benefit plan year.
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S4	Our self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims.
764401_18_ITEM8_P108_S5	We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates.
764401_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	We maintain general liability, business interruption and replacement cost property insurance coverage on our facilities.
764401_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	In August 2018, a transformer outage and electrical fire occurred at our Dayton, Texas manufacturing facility, which resulted in the temporary curtailment of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	Alternative power arrangements for the facility were subsequently made, allowing for operations to continue until permanent repairs could be completed.
764401_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	We are in the process of preparing the supporting analysis for the insurance claim related to the business interruption and property damage resulting from the fire.
764401_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	During 2018, we received $183,000 of insurance proceeds related to the claim and recorded a $462,000 receivable for the anticipated insurance proceeds associated with the expenses incurred as of the end of the year.
764401_18_ITEM8_P111_S2	The insurance proceeds attributable to the additional expenses incurred were recorded in cost of sales ($645,000) on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	In August 2017, operations at our manufacturing facility located in Dayton, Texas were adversely affected by hurricane Harvey.
764401_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	We are in the process of finalizing the supporting analysis for insurance claims relating to the business interruption and property damage resulting from the storm.
764401_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	During 2018, we received $439,000 of insurance proceeds related to the claim and recorded a $52,000 receivable for the anticipated insurance proceeds associated with the expenses that were incurred and capital outlays required to replace property and equipment damaged in the storm.
764401_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	The insurance proceeds attributable to the additional expenses incurred were recorded in cost of sales ($439,000), SG A expense ($26,000) and other income ($26,000) on the consolidated statements of operations.
764401_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	We believe the coverage provided for under our insurance policies is sufficient to cover the losses incurred from these claims.
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	Leases and p urchase c ommitments .
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	We lease a portion of our equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2023.
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	Additionally, we leased our facility in Houston, Texas through September 30, 2017 and subsequently exercised the $4.9 million purchase option under the lease in October 2017.
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S3	Under most lease agreements, we pay insurance, taxes and maintenance.
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S4	Rental expense for operating leases was $1.5 million in 2018 and $1.8 million in 2017 and 2016.
764401_18_ITEM8_P114_S5	As of September 29, 2018, minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one year are payable as follows: 2019, $1.0 million; 2020 $543,000; 2021, $185,000; 2022, $22,000 and 2023 and beyond, $16,000.
